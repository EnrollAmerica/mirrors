<p>Long-term care is a complex policy area which involves many of the  		programs of the Department of Health and Human Services. The projected increase  		in the number of elderly above the age of 75; the longer life expectancy of the  		disabled; and the inflation of nursing home, home health care, and personal  		care costs make it increasingly difficult to maintain the security of those in  		need of long-term care services. Federal, state, and local programs must be  		organized to use resources as efficiently as possible to assure the quality of  		care and quality of life of the long-term care population - both in the  		institution and in the community. Creative solutions to providing and financing  		long-term care must be developed, which acknowledge the desire of people to be  		independent and productive for as long as possible.</p>
<p>These Working Papers describe the current state of knowledge about  		long-term care in the United States, and serve as a knowledge base for the  		difficult analytic tasks that lie ahead. They are based on the work of the  		Department Task Force on Long-Term Care up to January, 1981 and contain data  		that have not been available before.</p>
<p>The Working Papers were prepared by staff of the Division of Long-Term  		Care Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,  		under the direction of Maureen Baltay. Barbara Manard served as the principal  		author and editor of these papers. Substantial contributions were made by John  		Grana. Numerous staff of the Department were responsible for much of the data,  		analysis, and documents on which these papers were based. They are listed in  		the appendix to Working Paper #1. Brenda Thorne typed the several drafts and  		was assisted by Jewell Griffin. Graphics were executed by Ray Shapiro and  		Vijaya Sonti.</p>

</dl><h2><a name="wp1" id="wp1">WORKING PAPER #1: OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Long-term care refers to the services required by people who have  		functional limitations as a result of or in conjunction with chronic illness or  		conditions. Appropriate long-term care services are fundamentally  		cross-cutting, involving both medical care and social support, with the line  		between them often blurred. Now, as in the distant past, families and friends  		provide most of the care received by the chronically disabled. In addition,  		there has been a substantial public role since the colonial era, though the  		nature and scope has changed over time.</p>
<p>Federal involvement in the care of the frail and dependent dates largely  		from the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935, prompted in part by  		widespread dissatisfaction with state and muncipal almshouses housing indigent  		disabled and elderly people. The Social Security Act and subsequent amendments  		established a complex patchwork of programs variously targeted by age, income,  		condition and largely organized along functional lines -- income support,  		social services, and medical care. These patterns of funding and organization  		are mirrored at every level of public responsibility: federal, state, and  		local. The Congress, government officials at all levels, consumers, and  		providers generally agree that the present programs often fail to promote  		desired objectives:</p>
<ul><li>the maximum feasible independence of the individual in making  		  decisions and in performing everyday activities;</li>
<li>the provision of services in the least restrictive environment,  		  preferably at home or in other community settings;</li>
<li>the provision of appropriate, cost-effective, accessible, and humane  		  care to all individuals who need it; and</li>
<li>the encouragement and support of the care provided by family and  		  friends.</li>
</ul><p>The Department of Health and Human Services administers most of the  		major federal programs which serve the chronically disabled. Escalating program  		costs, anticipated growth in the number of the aged and disabled, and  		increasing awareness of unsatisfactory aspects of the current system prompted  		Secretary Patricia Roberts Harris to establish the 1980 Task Force on long-term  		care. The scope of its responsibilities was considerably broader and the  		orientation of its activities significantly different from existing  		Departmental efforts involving long-term care issues.</p>
<p>The 1980 Task Force had three major responsibilities:</p>
<ol><li>To establish a clear organizational structure and lines of  		  responsibility for long-term care throughout the Department, creating a central  		  focus for policy development and program coordination;</li>
<li>To identify, analyze, and review priority long-term care issues which  		  required immediate attention; and</li>
<li>To begin the systemmatic and in-depth analysis which will lead to a  		  comprehensive long-term care policy for the Department.</li>
</ol><p>The Task Force was headed by the Under Secretary and the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and composed of senior officials at the  		level of Deputy Assistant Secretary from principal operating components and  		staff offices. The Task Force incorporated other related activities underway  		such as the implementation of the National Long-Term Care Demonstration  		Program, and established staff working groups to review research, budget, and  		analytical issues. These working groups were organized around eleven long-term  		care issues. Much of their work is incorporated in these Working Papers (See  		<a href="#append1-A">Appendix 1-A</a> for a complete list of Task Force members  		and staff). In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  		and each principal operating component in the Department established a  		long-term care organizational unit or function to signal its commitment to this  		key policy area and to ensure permanent staff capacity for these  		activities.</p>
<h4>Long-Term Care System Analysis</h4>
<p>A major problem which has confronted this Department and others in  		developing policy recommendations in long-term care has been the absence of a  		consistent and generally accepted definition of the issue. The characteristics  		of the population to be considered, the services which should be included, the  		overlap between services and settings, the definition of need, and the  		assessment of the extent to which it is currently being met have all been dealt  		with in fundamentally different ways at different times.</p>
<p>The development of a coordinated comprehensive long-term care policy  		requires a different approach. The Task Force agreed that as an initial step we  		need a common ground of understanding for the Department as a whole. This has  		meant standing back from specific program issues and attempting to define and  		understand basic elements of the current long-term care system and how they  		interact. The Task Force Working Papers represent one effort toward that goal.  		They are summarized below.</p>
<h3>A. <a href="#wp2">Working Paper #2</a>: The  		Population</h3>
<p>Approximately 30 million people or more than 13% of the total U. S.  		population have some "activity limitation" as a result of a chronic disease or  		condition. This long-term care population is varied one: varied in age, source  		of limitation, degree of disability and dependence on others, and in the  		capacity to obtain assistance on their own, through either personal or public  		financial resources or from families and friends.</p>
<p>Approximately 6.0 million people are substantially disabled. They  		include:</p>
<ul><li>Approximately 3.6 million individuals reporting a need for help with  		  personal care and/or mobility assistance or basic living services;</li>
<li>approximately 1.8 million individuals in long-term care institutions;  		  and</li>
<li>an estimated .6 million disabled individuals living in board and care  		  homes and other individuals not likely to have been interviewed in the National  		  Health Interview Survey.</li>
</ul><p>Older people are particularly vulnerable to chronic illness and  		accompanying functional disabilities. Eighty-five percent of the nursing home  		population (approximately 1.1 million people) is 65 years and older.  		Approximately 4% of the elderly living outside of institutions (approximately  		0.9 million people) have levels of functional disability so high that they  		require direct personal assistance in performing even the most basic activities  		of daily living.</p>
<p>The elderly -- and hence the potential long-term care population -- are  		a rapidly growing segment of the population. Furthermore, projected growth  		rates are greatest among the "old-old" who are the most vulnerable. According  		to the Series II Census projections, the population aged 65 and over is  		expected to increase by 26% between 1980 and 1999. The rate of increase among  		those 85 and over, however, will be twice that: in 1999 there will be 1.4  		million more very old people than there are today.</p>
<p>While the elderly are particularly vulnerable, there are numerically  		more younger people in the long-term care population. Those who are  		developmentally disabled, mentally retarded, chronically mentally ill may need  		more services over a life-time than those whose problems begin in old age.</p>
<p>Many people in the long-term care population have low incomes and this  		seriously compounds their problems. In 1977, 41% of the non-institutionalized  		functionally disabled had incomes less than $6,000; 46% of the functionally  		disabled age 65 and older had incomes less than $6,000. In comparison, only 16%  		of all individuals and 39% of all elderly were similarly poor. People who are  		too poor to purchase adequate services and whose family and friends are unable  		to help sufficiently find it difficult to maintain an independent existence in  		the community. Although most of the disabled live with others, who can help  		them, some 20% live alone and therefore must make arrangements to secure  		services -- services which are often accessible only in institutional  		settings.</p>
<h3>B. <a href="#wp3">Working Paper #3</a>: Services and  		Settings</h3>
<p>People in the long-term care population suffer from a wide variety of  		physical and mental conditions and often have multiple conditions and multiple  		service requirements. These needs range from social to medical, from basic  		living services to highly skilled technical ones needed to diagnose, test,  		treat, and manage chronic or acute illness.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Basic Living Services</b> are those services associated with the  			 maintenance of a household and participation in community life. They include  			 home maintenance, meals, chore, transportation, legal counseling, and the  			 like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Personal Care Services</b> are those services which assist  			 functionally limited individuals with, or directly provide for them, care of  			 the person including functions of bathing, eating, dressing, toilet ing, or  			 "activities of daily living".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Illness/Disability Services</b> include the full range of  			 diagnostic and therapeutic services directed at objectives related to the  			 management of chronic illness. They are services needed to identify the  			 etiology and pathology of the illness; to stabilize and manage the condition;  			 to decrease its rate of progression; to prevent acute flare-ups and  			 complications; and to maximize functional capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Theoretically, the full range of basic living, pesonal care, and health  		services for long-term care could be provided in any setting. At present,  		nearly two million people are in institutions and group settings -- mostly  		nursing homes.</p>
<p>Analysis of unpublished data indicates that the need for personal care  		services is a greater factor in institutionalization than has previously been  		thought.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Nursing home residents are considerably more functionally  			 dependendent than the non-institutionalized</b>.</p>
<ul><li>95% of the non-institutionalized, but only 10% of nursing home  				residents need no ADL asistance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>The greater the degree of dependency, the more likely is  			 institutionalization</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Elderly people who need a great deal of ADL assistance are more  			 likely to be in nursing homes than in the community</b>.</p>
<ul><li>4% of the nursing home population is over age 75 and needs help  				with all ADL activities.</li>
<li>There are three times as many people of that age and condition in  				nursing homes as in the community.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Nevertheless, functional needs alone do not determine whether or not an  		individual is cared for at home or in an institution. For example, among those  		who require some but not many personal care services (about 30% of the LTC  		population), for every one person in an institution, there are approximately  		three with similar needs functioning in the community. The availability of  		family and friends to help appears to be a critical distinguishing factor.</p>
<p>Thus, nursing homes are currently an important source of personal care  		services for people without families able or willing to provide these services,  		without the financial resources to purchase them in the community, or with  		personal care requirements which might be most efficiently provided in an  		institutional setting. While this is true, relatively few nursing have  		residents need nursing services or therapeutic services that can only be  		provided in an institutional setting. Further, recent research indicates that  		nursing homes provide very few rehabilitative services and that nursing home  		patients have remarkably little contact with skilled medical personnel.</p>
<p>Historical analyses and international comparison suggest that an average  		of 4 to 6% of the elderly population require or will use some type of group  		living arrangement (including nursing homes). The absence of family and/or the  		type and frequency of the services needed by some functionally disabled people  		make a group setting with others with similar needs practical and economical.  		However, there is nothing to suggest that nursing homes as we know them today  		are the preferred setting for all people who cannot live in their own homes. As  		the almshouses, boarding homes, retirement hotels, and rest homes of the past  		have been supplanted by nursing homes, new forms of group living arrangements  		-- notably congregate housing -- are emerging. They may prove to be suitable,  		less technically-oriented alternative settings, especially for potential  		nursing home residents who do not require much assistance in the activities of  		daily living or substantial nursing and therapeutic services.</p>
<p>The quality of long-term care institutions continues to be problemmatic.  		As long-term care services are extended into different community settings,  		quality assurance will become even more complex. These difficulties stem in  		part from the complexity of the long-term care mission. Long-term care  		institutions have been expected to rehabilitate the chronically ill, shelter  		the homeless, entertain the bored, and provide for the total psychosocial needs  		of people living and dying among strangers. In the absence of clearly defined  		goals and well-understood means of achieving them, it is difficult for  		institutions, largely staffed by semi-skilled workers, to evaluate successes  		and failures and to "improve." The results of federal efforts to encourage and  		ensure quality within the long-term care system reflect those inherent  		difficulties.</p>
<p>After more than fifteen years of direct federal efforts to upgrade  		nursing homes -- largely through a process of standards, certification, and  		inspections -- some progress has been made in the provision of clean and safe  		physical environments. The federal government has little authority over board  		and care facilities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that even minimum physical  		standards have not been achieved in that segment of the long-term care  		system.</p>
<p>Considerable problems remain in the assurance of quality <b>care</b>,  		regardless of setting. Quality of care objectives are more difficult to achieve  		than custodial goals because the elements of quality care are so poorly  		understood and there is no well-defined technology for either producing or  		evaluating quality care in long-term care settings. Nevertheless, some problems  		are striking and require redress: high rates of staff turnover in LTC  		facilities; repeated, if anecdotal, evidence of abuse; inadequate recognition  		that LTC facilities -- unlike hospitals -- are places where people live for  		long periods and hence should be designed, run, and financed accordingly -- as  		places for living.</p>
<p>These problems call for innovative and diverse approaches to quality  		assurance. Reliance on the regulatory methods emphasized to date appears to  		have produced only limited success.</p>
<h3>C. <a href="#wp4">Working Paper #4</a>: Programs and  		Financing for Long-Term Care Services</h3>
<p>Federal, state, and local governments fund a number of long-term care  		services. There are at least 80 Federal programs which benefit the disabled  		(and able) elderly, either directly or indirectly through cash assistance,  		in-kind transfers, or the direct provision of goods and services; Another  		source lists 150 programs which assist the handicapped by providing health,  		education, rehabilitation, income and housing.</p>
<p>The DHHS programs which fund the majority of long-term care services are  		funded by Medicare, Medicaid, and Title XX of the Social Security Act, and  		Title III of the Older Americans Act. None of them was designed to meet  		long-term care needs or targeted on the long-term care population per se.</p>
<p>Additional programs include:</p>
<ul><li>housing programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban  		  Development, the Veterans Administration, the Farmers Home Loan Administration,  		  and individual municipalities;</li>
<li>institutional care programs administered by a number of agencies in  		  DHHS, by VA, and the States; and</li>
<li>social, cane unity residential and health service programs  		  administered by DHHS, VA, CSA, the States, and local jurisdictions.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there are supplemental income programs such as Disability  		Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) which provide income to  		people too disabled to work and to the very low income elderly. Benefit levels  		range from a monthly average of $322 for the DI program to $357 for families  		($238 for individuals) in the SSI program (including optional state  		supplementation). While these programs are designed to cover basic living  		expenses, they are not intended to cover the special service requirements of  		the long-term care population.</p>
<p>Eligibility for these programs is defined by age (Medicare, OAA), income  		(Medicaid, Title XX, SSI), condition (Medicare, DI, SSI) or a combination  		(e.g., Medicaid ICF/MR) even though the need for long-term care is more broadly  		defined. As a result, there are both gaps and overlaps in eligibility under  		present programs.</p>
<p>Since the range of services which provide assistance to the chronically  		disabled is broad, it is difficult to isolate how much is actually spent on  		long-term care from all sources, public and private. Nor is it possible with  		existing data to substantiate some widely held beliefs, namely, that spending  		for health services is much greater then spending for social services, and that  		spending for nursing home care is substantially larger than spending for  		non-institutional care.</p>
<p>Some evidence can be cited in support of those conclusions. For example,  		total federal expenditures for nursing home care were over ten times the  		expenditures for home health in 1978. Further, the entire federal share of  		Title XX, including the costs of all social programs, was only about half of  		the federal share of nursing home costs in the same year. Nevertheless, the  		conclusions commonly drawn from such isolated facts cannot be substantiated for  		total public and private spending.</p>
<p>One problem is that the indirect use of public dollars provided through  		the Social Security program for long-term care services in institutional or  		community settings cannot be calculated. Further, some services financed under  		health care programs are actually "basic living services." For example, money  		spent on nursing home care pays for food and housing as well as nursing.  		Finally, the extent to which the patterns of expenditure are appropriate is  		difficult to judge without more detailed analyses of population needs and  		service effectiveness.</p>
<p>Where expenditures can be clearly related to long-term care, it is clear  		that costs are high and are rapidly increasing.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Expenditures for nursing home care totalled $15.8 billion in 1978 or  			 8 percent of all health care expenditures. Over half (54%) of this spending is  			 derived from public sources. In that same year, 39 percent of all Medicaid  			 benefits were for nursing home expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicaid nursing have expenditures rose 22% per year from 1974 to  			 1978.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicare have health expenditures rose 44.6% per year from 1975 to  			 1979.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This inflation in the nursing home sector (along with even more rapid  		inflation in home health services) has serious implications for the public and  		private role in financing long-term care. First, more rapid inflation in  		nursing home services than in the general economy means fewer people can pay  		for services privately, placing increasing pressure on public budgets. Rapidly  		increasing costs increase the probability that Medicaid will have to pay the  		nursing have bill. Also, available data indicate that although nursing home  		care costs per resident were approximately $8,011 in 1975, average per capita  		income for those over 65 was only $5,349. While the majority of nursing home  		patients initially use private funds, a substantial proportion convert to  		public sources of payment after exhausting personal resources during the first  		year.</p>
<p>This diminution of private ability to finance LTC services is a matter  		of serious concern; to the extent that the public nursing have bill absorbs  		additional resources, it will be more difficult to target funds on alternatives  		to nursing have care and other possible system changes.</p>
<h3>D. <a href="#wp5">Working Paper #5</a>: Dynamics of the  		Current System</h3>
<p>The long-term care system is extraordinarily complex, encompassing  		issues in the areas of health, housing, transportation, social services, income  		security and jobs. The long-term care population is extremely diverse in its  		functional disabilities, illnesses, needs, desires, personal resources and  		living arrangements. Poor data and rudimentary analytical methods limit our  		understanding of long-term care to isolated segments of the system and to short  		time periods.</p>
<p>Current evidence is inadequate to conclude that there is currently a  		national surplus or shortage of nursing have beds and other long-term care  		services and settings. With regard to nursing have beds, reports of overuse and  		misplacement (indications of possible surpluses) are to be contrasted with  		reports of long queues of people waiting to enter nursing homes (possibly  		indicating bed shortages). Both conditions, of course, may exist at the same  		time: Individuals may demand care who do not need it because of the lack of  		alternatives, or because of incentives to enter an institution owing to  		distorted price signals obtained from the public reimbursement mechanism. On  		the other hand, measurement of "appropriateness" of placement is still in the  		early stages of development, and is highly subjective; there are many  		determinants of nursing home need and use other than functional disability  		which are not captured by existing assessment methods.</p>
<p>Reliable data on the nation's nursing home bed supply are available only  		up to 1976; measurement of recent trends is impossible. The combination of wide  		variation in the ratio of beds to population across the States and no accepted  		standard of adequacy suggests the issue of a nursing home bed supply shortage  		or surplus is a state specific issue. Evaluation of local health plans  		indicates there are perceived shortages in some states and surpluses in others,  		perceptions being highly correlated with current availability of beds.</p>
<p>Even less is known about the adequacy of non-institutional services.  		These services have traditionally been provided by family, friends, community  		and private sector providers, at relatively little public expense and with  		little public oversight. Consequently, useful information in this area is  		rare.</p>
<p>Evidence does appear to indicate that the choices of living arrangements  		available to the elderly have narrowed in the past 50 years. The proportion of  		the elderly population in institutions grew only slightly over the first half  		of this century; recent, more rapid growth has resulted mainly from large  		recent increases in the relative numbers of "old-old" (over 75 years) and  		increasing rates of instititutionalization of this group. Nursing homes,  		formerly homes for the aged, have only recently become the predominant  		institution providing shelter and long-term care to the chronically ill and  		functionally dependent. This development has occured at the expense of other  		types of institutions and "near-institutions," especially once-important "group  		quarters." As a consequence, the spectrum of non-medical settings available to  		the elderly has narrowed.</p>
<p>The growing cost of nursing have care has prompted studies of the costs  		and cost-effectiveness of care delivered in alternative settings. Available  		studies appear to indicate that for slightly impaired people, alternatives are  		more economical than nursing homes; for severely impaired people the opposite  		is true. What is not known is the break-even point, and how to determine for  		which individuals which particular services and settings are  		cost-effective.</p>
<p>Some studies indicate that some alternatives tend to became additions  		to, not substitutes for, existing services, with very costly implications:  		additional costs tend to outweigh savings from reduced institutionalization.  		This experience is apparently replicated in Europe, where the ready  		availability of have based services does little to displace  		institutionalization. One of the most difficult research questions is the  		extent to which the availability of formal support services retards  		institutionalization without destroying the fabric of the informal support  		network and its willingness to provide care.</p>
<p>It is clear that, presently, we are less equipped than is desirable to  		capture the simultaneous interactions among all facets of long-term care and  		the dynamics of the long-term care system as a whole.</p>

<h3>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>The Long-Term Care Task Force adopted a broad rather than narrow  		definition of the long-term care population, including individuals of all ages,  		not just the elderly, and all persons disabled by chronic conditions, whether  		these conditions are physical or mental in origin. Stated briefly, the  		definition is as follows:</p>

<p></p><center><br /><div class="bordered-text">The long-term care population consists of people who are  				functionally disabled as a result of or in conjunction with chronic illness or  				conditions.</div>

<p></p></center>
<p>For Task Force purposes, then, the long-term care population encompasses  		several important subgroups: those elderly disabled by chronic conditions, the  		physically handicapped, the developmentally disabled, the chronically mentally  		ill and the mentally retarded. Although the particular combination of services  		required by members of each of these groups may differ, the general nature of  		their conditions and resulting overall service requirements appear to be  		similar enough to warrant efforts to integrate the development of overall  		program policy to the extent possible. Since the Department of Health and Human  		Services already had underway two planning efforts focusing particularly on the  		chronically mentally ill and the mentally retarded, the Task Force has not  		initiated separate analyses pertaining to these subgroups. Rather, an attempt  		has been made to include material from those planning efforts in these Working  		Papers.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. Chronic Conditions, Functional Disability, and  		Service Requirements</h3>
<p>Chronic conditions are defined as those in which nonreversible  		pathological alterations or congenital deficits cause residual disability which  		requires habilitation or rehabilitation, supervision and care over a long  		period of time. Acute conditions, by contrast, are those which entail single  		episodes of fairly short duration.</p>
<p>The National Center for Health Statistics, for the purposes of the  		Health Interview Survey, uses two criteria to distinguish chronic from acute  		illness. First, a chronic condition is one which was noticed more than three  		months before the interview. Further, some conditions are always classified as  		chronic, including: allergy; diabetes; hemorrhoids; hernia; mental illness;  		missing fingers, hand, arm, toes, foot, or leg; speech defect; stomach ulcer;  		tuberculosis; and trouble with varicose veins.</p>
<p>Obviously, the type of long-term care required by schizophrenics differs  		from that required by diabetics. Further, there is considerable variation among  		people in the severity, responsiveness to treatment, and so forth of any one  		condition. Thus, simply knowing the number of people with various types of  		chronic diseases is not very useful to discussions of long-term care  		services.</p>
<p>There is widespread agreement that long-term care service "needs" are  		more closely related to functional disability than to chronic disease or  		condition, per se. Hence the Task Force adopted a framework for analysis which  		characterizes the long-term care population according to different levels or  		types of functional disability. As the data are reviewed in the following  		sections, two important caveats should be kept in mind:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The available national data are based on very imprecise measures of  			 functional disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter how sophisticated the measure of functional disability, it  			 is still difficult to relate the need for particular types or amounts of  			 service to various levels of disability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>People who are more disabled in some sense than others may need fewer  		services, depending on a variety of factors. Empirically there are only very  		tenuous links between physical characteristics (a missing leg), physical  		functioning (ability to walk), and social functioning (ability to get and keep  		a job); it is difficult to predict any one characteristic, knowing another.  		Even more obscure is the relationship between any of these and the need for  		particular services. Further, it is difficult to define "levels" of functional  		disability because "disability" is less an individual characteristic than a  		characteristic of individual and environmental interaction: blind men may be  		less "disabled" in the dark than the sighted. Nevertheless, it is useful to  		consider estimates of the numbers of people in the long-term care population  		with different degrees and types of functional disability, broadly defined.</p>
<h3>C. Estimates of the Size of the Long-Term Care  		Population</h3>
<h4>The Non-Institutional Population: Levels of  		Functional Disability</h4>
<p>Approximately 30 million people, or more than 13% of the total U. S.  		population, according to the 1977 National Health Interview Survey, have some  		"activity limitation" as a result of a chronic disease or condition.  		<a href="#table2-I">Table I</a> presents estimates of the size of this  		population according to various levels of disability.</p>
<p>These levels are defined as follows:</p>
<p><b>LEVEL I</b>: (Approximately 20 million people) includes all those  		with some "activity limitation" due to chronic conditions, but who are still  		able to conduct their "major activity."</p>
<p><b>LEVEL II</b>: (7.7 million people) refers to people who report that  		they are unable to conduct their "major activity" because of a chronic  		condition. The National Health Interview Survey defines inability to conduct  		major activity according to four broad categories:</p>
<ol><li>Pre-school children: inability to take part in ordinary play with  		  other children.</li>
<li>School-age children: inability to go to school.</li>
<li>Housewives: inability to do any housework.</li>
<li>Workers and all other persons: inability to work at a job or  		  business.</li>
</ol><p>Thus, "major activity" does not necessarily refer to a person's own  		perception of his or her usual, desirable, or most important activity. Instead,  		it refers to pre-determined categories of activity. As a measure of functional  		impairment it works better for adult men than for adult women. Most of those  		women who are not employed -- in part because of chronic conditions -- but who  		are able to do housework are not counted in Level II. Similarly disabled men  		would normally be included in this level. Problems are also encountered when  		the concept of major activity limitation is applied to the elderly since most  		of them are likely to be retired. Consequently, assessing the comparability of  		levels of disability between the population under and over 65 is difficult when  		the "major activity" criteria is used.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>LEVEL III</b>: (3.6 million people) refers to people reporting a need  		for help getting around the house, neighborhood, or community ("mobility  		assistance"). Without help from family, friends, or formal community services,  		many people at Level III would be unable to maintain an independent household.  		Included in this group are those who may require such basic living services as  		transportation, help with meal preparation, and chore services.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL IV</b>: (1.6 million people) refers to those who report needing  		help with personal care and hygiene, that is, "activities of daily living":  		eating, dressing, bathing, and using the toilet. This group includes those most  		"at risk" for institutionalization and is discussed in greater detail in  		<a href="#wp3">Working Paper #3</a>.</p>
<h4>Interrelation Among The Levels Of  		Disability</h4>
<p><a href="#figure2-I">Figure I</a> illustrates the relationships among  		the various levels of disability. In general, each successively higher level of  		disability is a subset of the previous level. As one might expect, most people  		who need help with personal care (Level IV) also need help getting around the  		neighborhood (Level III), and are also unable to conduct their major activity  		(Level II). There are, however, a number of significant and interesting  		exceptions to this pattern. For example, a paraplegic may need help with  		bathing or dressing (Level IV), and may yet report no need for help getting  		around the house (Level III) because special aids, devices, and architectural  		features transform the environment, reducing the functional importance of a  		physical disability. Similarly, many who are dependent on others for help with  		the most basic elements of daily life are yet quite capable</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure2-I" id="figure2-I"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68481/wrkpprF1.gif" /></a></div>
<h4>The Institutionalized Population</h4>
<p>There are approximately 1.5 to 2 million individuals who are  		institutionalized in long-term care facilities. <a href="#figure2-II">Figure  		II</a> shows the distribution of institutional long-term care beds. As can be  		seen, nursing homes comprise 69% of the beds.</p>
<h4>Under-counted Groups</h4>
<p>The National Health Interview Survey and other sources of national data  		based on household samples under-represent the number of disabled people in  		board and care facilities and other group settings not classified as  		institutions. The increasing importance of these settings in long-term care has  		been recognized and plans for future national surveys address the problem of  		obtaining more accurate data.</p>
<h4>The Core Population</h4>
<p>Recognizing the serious need for better data, the Task Force  		nevertheless estimated that approximately 6 million people form the core of the  		long-term care population. These 6 million represent a potential target group  		within the larger population of disabled. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Approximately 3.6 million individuals reporting a need for help with  		  personal care and/or mobility assistance or basic living services (Levels III  		  or IV);</li>
<li>approximately 1.8 million individuals in long-term care institutions;  		  and</li>
<li>an estimated .6 million disabled individuals living in board and care  		  homes and other individuals not likely to have been interviewed in the  		  NHIS.</li>
</ul><h3>D. Estimating the Size of Subgroups in the Long-Term  		Care Population </h3>
<h4>The Chronically Mentally Ill</h4>
<p>The National Plan for the Chronically Mentally Ill defines the  		chronically mentally ill population as encompassing: "those persons who suffer  		certain mental or emotional disorders that erode or prevent the development of  		their functional capacities in relation to three or more of such primary  		aspects of daily life as personal hygiene and self-care, self-direction,  		interpersonal relationships, social transactions, learning and recreation and  		that erode or prevent the development of their economic  		self-sufficiency."<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The National Plan identified 1.7 million people as the CMI target  		population. Approximately 800,000 are individuals living in the community and  		unable to work. Thus, about 10% of the Level II non-institutionalized  		population are disabled by chronic mental conditions.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>An additional 900,000 people in institutions are counted in the CMI  		target population. This estimate is based on a very broad conception of  		"chronic mental illness" as it includes all people who have any chronic mental  		condition, including "senility," and all of those regardless of whether the  		condition is the primary reason for admission to an institution or a secondary  		diagnosis. By this estimate, 58% of the nursing home population is included in  		the CMI target group.</p>

<h4>The Mentally Retarded and Developmentally Disabled</h4>
<p>Mental retardation is a diagnostic classification which includes all  		individuals who have significantly below average intellectual functioning as  		measured by standardized tests. The broader concept of developmental  		disabilities is a functional classification, including individuals with severe  		chronic disabilities occurring before age 22, attributable to physical or  		mental impairments, and causing limitations in three or more major life  		activities such as self-care, learning, and economic sufficiency.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Some, but not all people  		classified as mentally retarded (because they score low on an I.Q. test) are  		also classified as being developmentally disabled (because they are  		functionally limited). The National Task Force for the Definition of  		Developmental Disabilities estimated that there are approximately 2.8 million  		people with developmental disabilities. Of those, an estimated 1 million were  		mentally retarded. Current data do not permit classification of these  		populations by the levels of functional disability (Level II, III, etc.)  		described above. According to the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey, however,  		almost 80,000 or 6.1 percent of nursing home residents had a primary diagnosis  		of mental retardation.</p>
<h4>Adult Physically  		Disabled</h4>
<p>There is no one commonly agreed on definition of the adult physically  		disabled. Traditionally this group has included those who are blind, deaf,  		paralyzed, and otherwise "visibly" physically handicapped. <a href="#table2-II">Table II</a> presents estimates from the National Health  		Interview Survey of those who are limited in their major activity (Level II)  		because of such conditions. Blindness is the most prevalent condition, followed  		by paralysis and impairments of the back and spine.</p>
<p>Increasing attention has been focused in recent years on those with  		"hidden" handicaps such as epilepsy and alcoholism. Once viewed principally as  		a moral flaw, alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse have been variously  		defined and redefined over the years as forms of criminal behavior, evidence of  		"mental illness" and -- some would argue -- "physical handicaps" with a  		substantially biological etiological component. However people with such  		conditions are classified, to the extent to which they experience functional  		limitations over a long period of time, they are included in the long-term care  		population. Approximately 1% of the total long-term care beds can be identified  		as serving "drug abusers or alcoholics" (<a href="#figure2-II">Figure II</a>).  		Most observers agree, however, that a substantial proportion of the  		institutionalized population has problems associated with chronic  		alcoholism.</p>
<h3>E. The Age and Income of the Long-Term Care  		Population</h3>
<p>The age and income distributions of the long-term care population are  		interesting, in part because these characteristics are criteria for various  		public benefits.</p>
<p>As can be seen in <a href="#table2-I">Table I</a>, there are only  		slightly more people over age 65 than under among the non-institutionalized at  		Levels II and IV. Men age 75 is used as the cut-off point, there are more young  		people than elderly in the long-term care population. The elderly, however, are  		substantially more likely to be disabled. Proportionally, 17 percent of all  		elderly persons living in the community are disabled enough to fit within Level  		II, compared with only 2 percent of all persons under 65 years of age. For  		Level III, the relative proportions are 9 percent of those over 65 years and .8  		percent for those under 65 (<a href="#append2-A">Appendix 2-A</a>).</p>
<p>Poverty in some cases is a result of chronic illness and in all cases  		severely complicates the lives of those afflicted. Old age, poverty, and  		chronic illness can be, quite literally, a deadly combination. Both the young  		and the old disabled alike have lower incomes than their peers. The income  		disparity is far more pronounced for the working age disabled than for the  		elderly, as would be expected, though the aged are more likely to be both  		disabled and poor. Two percent of the elderly but less than one percent of all  		younger people have incomes below $6,000 and need personal care services (See  		<a href="#append2-A">Appendix 2-A</a>).</p>
<h3>F. The Future Size of the Long-Term Care Population</h3>
<p>The number of people who will need long-term care services in the future  		depends on an enormous array of factors including economic conditions,  		demographic changes, and patterns of family organization. Scientific advances  		are certain to have an impact, though in ways which are unpredictable. On one  		hand, it may become possible to prevent or cure certain chronic conditions and  		hence reduce the number needing long-term care, as did the conquest of polio.  		Barring major breakthroughs, however, continued incremental improvements in the  		management of chronic conditions and further reductions in general mortality  		are likely to increase the size of the long-term care population.</p>

</tr></table><p>The aging of the U. S. population is both the most predictable element  		in future projections and the fact with the most dramatic implications for  		long-term care. Overall, it is expected that the percentage of persons with  		activity limitation due to chronic conditions will increase by 13 to 23 per  		cent by 1990 (the growth rates depend on different mortality assumptions). Most  		of this growth is projected to occur in the older age groups (<a href="#figure2-III">Figure III</a>).</p>
<p>At the same time, depending on the mortality assumptions employed, the  		nursing home population is projected to increase by 28 to 56 percent over the  		next ten years if current patterns of use are continued. Increased demand for  		nursing home care is expected to be particularly great among persons 85 years  		and older (<a href="#figure2-IV">Figure IV</a>).</p>
<p>Based on these projections, the Task Force has estimated that the target  		long-term care population could increase between 25 and 50 percent over the  		next decade, since this target population includes a large number of older and  		highly dependent members of the more general population. According to these  		estimates, a long-term care target population of 6 million persons in 1980  		could increase to 7.5 or 9 million by 1990.</p>
<p>If the proportions of the long-term care population cared for in various  		settings remain constant, roughly a third of this projected increase would  		occur within the institutionalized population, with 2.5 to 3 million persons in  		these facilities by 1990 (provided there is a commensurate increase in the  		supply of institutional beds).</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure2-III" id="figure2-III"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68481/wrkpprF3.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Over the same time period, another third of this population growth would  		occur among those persons currently living in the community who are potential  		candidates for institutional services due to disability and limited resources.  		This group would increase by 2.5 to 3 million persons. The remaining population  		increase would occur among those persons living in the community with resources  		sufficient enough to make institutionalization unlikely.</p>
<p>These changes are likely to further exacerbate current problems in the  		organization and financing of long-term care services.</p>

<h3>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>Definitions of long-term care services are often tautological: long-term  		care services are those services used/needed by the long-term care population.  		There is widespread agreement, however, that the nature of chronic conditions  		demands a very broad view of services to include those which are 'social' as  		well as 'medical', those rendered informally by family and friends as well as  		formally by public or private agencies. The Task Force considered three generic  		sets of services:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Basic Living Services</b> are those services associated with the  			 maintenance of a household and participation in community life. They include  			 have maintenance, meals, chores, transportation, and the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Personal Care Services</b> are those services which assist  			 functionally limited individuals with bathing, eating, dressing, using the  			 toilet, ("activities of daily living").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Illness/Disability Services</b> include the full range of  			 diagnostic and therapeutic services directed at objectives related to the  			 management of chronic illness. They are services needed to identify the  			 etiology and pathology of the illness; to stabilize and manage the condition;  			 to decrease its rate of progression; to prevent acute flare-ups and  			 complications; and to maximize functional capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The boundaries of these categories are imprecise. For example, "basic  		living" always includes food, but meals may also be part of a highly complex  		therapeutic plan. The chief virtue of the typology for Task Force purposes is  		that it emphasizes the distinctions among services, settings, and programs. The  		incremental development of the current long-term care "system" has resulted in  		a complicated pattern where public social services programs (e.g., Title XX)  		support health care services, health care programs support social services  		(Medicaid), some sets of services are "pre-packaged" in settings (e.g., nursing  		homes), while individually tailored service packages are difficult to organize  		in any setting.</p>
<p>Ultimately we would like to have a comprehensive picture of the  		availability, use, efficacy, costs, sources of funding and so forth of each  		service set. Because the framework used for Task Force analysis departs from  		the way public programs have been structured, reliable national data are not  		available. The discussion in this paper represents a preliminary  		exploration.</p>
<h3>B. Types of Services</h3>
<h4>Basic Living Services</h4>
<p>At a minimum the long-term care population needs what everyone needs:  		food, shelter, clothing, transportation, companionship, and assistance in time  		of crisis. The additional and exceptional demands of chronic disabling  		conditions complicate the ordinary process of living. We know very little about  		how most such people manage -- particularly those who never come to the  		attention of social service agencies -- though such information would be  		enormously useful. We do know that family and friends provide most of the basic  		help:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>According to the National Health Interview Survey, among the  			 chronically disabled who require help getting around the house or neighborhood  			 (level II), 88% report that relatives provide the necessary help. Approximately  			 25% receive help from someone other than a friend or relative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A GAO study of services for the elderly in Cleveland (1977  			 preliminary report) showed that 23 percent of the sample were assessed as  			 impaired. Of those impaired, 56 percent were receiving services from family or  			 friends. Provided on this informal basis were transportation (60%), "checking"  			 (stopping by to look in on) (44%), homemaking (20%), administrative and legal  			 (15%), meal preparation (13%), housing services (12%), coordination (8%),  			 groceries and food stamps (7%), continuous supervision (6%), nursing care (3%),  			 and general financial help (2%). When these elderly were asked if someone were  			 available if they were sick or disabled, 87% answered "yes". Of those who did  			 have a person who would be available, 89% named a family member.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1977, a national probability sample revealed that the primary  			 caretaker of the bedfast elderly was the spouse: 38% of the housework was done  			 by spouse, 44% of the meal preparation, and 30% of the shopping.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> Children within and outside of the household  			 were the next helping source. Formal social service agencies were infrequently  			 mentioned.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>While the importance of family, community networks, and informal  		services in long-term care cannot be overly stressed, little is known about the  		relationship between these and formal services or public programs. It has been  		argued that the development of respite care, adult day care, and similar  		services may relieve some stress on families of the disabled and enhance their  		ability and willingness to continue caring for the aged and dependent. On the  		other hand, some fear that public subsidies for community-based services may  		encourage the substitution of formal for informal services. Research to date is  		very limited and inconclusive.</p>
<h4>Personal Care Services</h4>
<p>A considerable amount of information is available on the need for  		personal care services among the institutional and non-institutional  		population. The 1977 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the 1977 National  		Nursing Home Survey, and numerous local studies use cannon elements of the  		index of Activities of Daily Living developed by Dr. Sidney Katz to assess  		functional capacity, which allows profitable comparisons. The index is based on  		an evaluation of the functional independence of patients in bathing, dressing,  		using the toilet, transferring (i.e. moving from bed to a chair) continence,  		and feeding. Independence means without supervision, direction, or active  		personal assistance. Ratings are given based on the actual performance of the  		patient, regardless of his/her ability; refusal to perform an activity is  		judged the same as incapacity. Thus, the Katz Index of ADL also provides an  		indirect measure of psychological status.</p>
<p><b>The Non-Institutional Population</b>: About 1.4 million (4.8%) of  		non-institutionalized chronically ill and functionally dependent population  		need help in bathing, 1.0 million (3.6%) need help in dressing, 0.5 million  		(1.9%) need help in going to the toilet, and 0.3 million (1.1%) need help in  		eating. With the 4 ADL measures, a 5-level index can be specified (<a href="#table3-I">Table I</a>). The vast majority (95.6%) of the 28.5 million  		non institutionalized chronically ill and functionally dependent do not need  		assistance with ADL's.</p>
<p>The relationship between age and functional status was discussed briefly  		in <a href="#wp2">Working Paper #2</a>. <a href="#table3-II">Table II</a> shows  		this relationship in greater detail and indicates score potential problems with  		an age-based long-term care strategy. Although older people (particularly those  		over 85) are more likely than others to need personal care services, at every  		level of ADL dependency, there are more people who need personal care services  		under age 75 than over.</p>
<p>As with basic living services, relatives are a major source of help with  		all ADL Tasks. Almost 20% of those with greater dependence, however, report  		that help is given by a "nurse" (see <a href="#append3-A">Appendix  		3-A</a>).</p>
<p><b>The Institutional Population</b>: The analysis of unpublished data  		from the Health Interview Survey allowed the Task Force to examine the  		relationship between ADL dependency and institutionalization on a national  		scale. <a href="#table3-III">Table III</a> compares the functional dependency  		of the non-institutionalized long-term care population to the nursing home  		population. The National Nursing Home Survey used a six point ADL scale, while  		the Health Interview Survey used a five point scale, so comparable levels of  		dependency can only be approximated. <a href="#table3-III">Table III</a>  		indicates that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Nursing home residents are considerably more functionally  			 dependent than the non-institutionalized</b>.</p>
<ul><li>Only 5% of the non-institutionalized, but 95% of nursing have  				residents need ADL assistance.</li>
<li>Less than 1% of the non-institutionalized, but 49% of the nursing  				home population and 52% of those patients over age 75 need help with all ADL  				activities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>The greater the degree of dependency, the more likely is  			 institutionalization</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Among those with some, but not many ADL needs, more people live  			 in the community than in nursing homes</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Elderly people who need a great deal of ADL assistance are more  			 likely to be in nursing tonnes than in the community</b>.</p>
<ul><li>44% of the nursing home population is over age 75 and needs help  				with all ADLs.</li>
<li>There are three times as many people of that age and condition in  				nursing homes as in the community.</li>
</ul></li>

</tr></table><p>These findings indicate that the need for personal care services is a  		greater factor in institutionalization than has been thought.

</tr></table><h4>Illness/Disability ("Health Care")  		Services</h4>
<p>Chronic illness accounts for a large proportion of the use of health  		care services. For example, only 17% of the elderly are limited in their major  		activity by chronic illness, but this group accounts for 30% of the physician  		visits and nearly 50% of the hospital days among the elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The therapeutic goals and types of health services interventions  		required to manage chronic illness are different from those appropriate for  		acute illnesses; even the management of acute episodes of illness differs for  		patients with chronic diseases since their recovery from the acute problem  		means return to the chronic illness and not full health. Generally, treatment  		of chronic illness is considered to require continuing management to reduce  		acute flare-ups, minimize complications, maximize periods of remission and  		maximize maintenance of functional capabilities. Because the underlying  		mechanisms of chronic disease are so poorly understood, medical management  		involves what Lewis Thomas calls a "halfway technology".<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> It often involves a great deal of trial and  		error, multiple pharmacological and dietary approaches, and a great deal of  		supportive nursing. The distinctions between "medical treatment" and social  		support became blurred with chronic illness.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the medical management of chronic illness, it  		is very difficult to determine the relative importance of "health care" to  		other services in long-term care. Two of the major public programs which serve  		the long-term care population (Medicare and Medicaid) are fundamentally health  		care programs. This has led to the conclusion that public efforts represent an  		"over-medicalization" of long-term care. The controversy is in large part over  		the appropriate locus for authority and public financing in long-term care;  		whether long-term care should be developed as an extension of "medical"  		programs, social service programs, or an all together new program. Determining  		the types of services being provided under these programs is a separate issue.  		Some argue that despite the apparent medical orientation of public long-term  		care programs, the health care needs of the chronically ill, particularly the  		elderly, are often severely neglected, particularly in nursing homes. These  		critics argue that nursing home residents are as isolated from high quality  		medical care as they are from community social life. Some evidence supports  		this contention.</p>
<p>One of the few careful examinations of what nursing homes really do is  		Gottesman and Burestom's study of activities in forty "elite" skilled nursing  		homes in Detroit (1974). They found that only 2% of the resident's time was  		spent receiving "skilled nursing." Contact with any staff member filled only  		10% of the residents' time -- about half of this was personal care  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> Similarly,  		national surveys indicate that nursing have residents see physicians an average  		of seven times a year -- only slightly more than the non-institutionalized  		elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Some local studies also emphasize scanty contact with health  		professionals. A relatively early study of nursing homes in three states found  		that few facilities provided more than personal care services.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Similarly, a recent study of 87  		California SNF's found that only 10% of the residents received physical  		therapy, though staff believed half needed it.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> A particularly interesting finding of the  		California study was that only 8% of the residents of skilled nursing  		facilities for the "mentally disordered" received any "psychological therapy"  		beyond that provided on an <b>ad hoc</b> basis by the nursing staff. Similarly,  		a Texas study found that therapeutic services were generally unavailable to  		mental patients in nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Task Force was unable to determine on a national basis the degree to  		which the illness/disability services needs of the long-term care population  		are being met. There is considerable controversy about the appropriate  		treatment of even single chronic diseases and disabilities. What did became  		clear, however, was that simple counts of the services received under health  		care programs, particularly for institutional care, give a very poor picture of  		the actual availability and use of illness/disability services in long-term  		care.</p>
<h3>C. Settings: Selected Issues</h3>
<h4>Institutional and Community Services</h4>
<p>Most people with functional dependencies due to chronic illness live "in  		the community." Seventy-five percent of those identified by the Task Force as  		the core long-term care population live in various "community" settings, from  		skid raw flop houses to Palm Beach condominiums. The other 1.5 million are in  		institutions, primarily nursing homes, though the proportion who will ever  		become institutionalized is considerably higher.</p>
<p>Much of the current public discussion of long-term care service  		organization focuses on this distinction between community and institutional  		settings. "Preventing or reducing inappropriate institutional care by providing  		for community-based care" is a national goal, stated as an objective of Title  		XX of the Social Security Act.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> The right to care in "the least restrictive  		environment" is increasingly sanctioned by courts. In practice, preventing  		unnecessary institutionalization has largely meant working to keep the elderly  		out of nursing homes and other mentally and physically handicapped people out  		of large state institutions.</p>
<p>Estimating the extent of inappropriate institutionalization is difficult  		and depends on the instrument used, the weight given to medical versus social  		factors in placement, and different judgments about what level of disability  		requires institutionalization. The Congressional Budget office's estimates of  		inappropriate institutionalization of the elderly (10-40%) are often cited. The  		report is five years old, however, and some of the studies on which the CBO  		estimates were based date from the 1960's. Studies based on more recent data,  		including the previously unpublished data in this paper, indicate that the  		degree of inappropriate nursing have use is probably lower than had been  		thought. This may be partly the result of more experience in using assessment  		tools and the greater prevalence of nursing home screening programs.</p>
<p>Among the most recent studies is the work of Beth Soldo and her  		colleagues. They reanalyzed data on persons age 60 and over from the 1976  		Survey of Institutionalized Persons (S.I.P.) - a nationally representative  		sample of long-term care facilities. Scales were constructed which measured  		various dimensions of functional health, excluding direct indicators of  		cognitive ability and emotional stability for which data were not available.  		They found that "using the most conservative criteria that include functional  		dependency, need for nursing services, and the presence of other physical  		impairments, the estimated number of elderly for whom long-term care placement  		appears unnecessary approaches 100,000 persons."<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> While this is a substantial number of  		people, it is less than 10% of the institutionalized elderly.</p>
<p>Although there is some indication that previous estimates of the degree  		of inappropriate nursing home use may not reflect the current situation, it is  		incorrect to assume that "the problem has been solved." Surveys of those  		currently in institutions do not accurately reflect the conditions of people at  		the point of entry, when they may be less disabled. By this line of reasoning,  		cross-sectional studies may under-estimate the degree of inappropriate  		institutionalization. Practical experience in a number of areas and  		demonstration projects do indicate that where people can be linked to  		appropriate alternative services, a significant proportion can be maintained in  		the community, though it is unknown for how long. For example, Virginia has a  		mandatory prescreening program for all Medicaid clients who apply for admission  		to nursing homes. Approximately 22% have been diverted, at least temporarily,  		to community care.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>Housing with Services</h4>
<p>Providing care "in the least restrictive environment" is not just an  		issue of "institutional" versus "home" care. The characteristic which makes  		institutional life objectionable to so many is not the intensity of available  		services nor neccessarily the size of a facility, nor the fact that many people  		live in the same building. Rather, it is the abnormal patterning of daily life,  		which is in large part a function of the organization of services, and to some  		extent a function of architecture. Congregate housing is one mode of providing  		services in a large-scale "non-institutional" setting to people for whoa  		complete independence is inappropriate, undesirable, or too costly. (See  		<a href="#append3-B">Appendix 3-B</a> for a description of federal housing  		programs, some of which include services for the disabled).</p>
<p>"Congregate" housing is both a programmatic and a generic term. It is  		officially defined in federal legislation as "low income housing which has an  		available central dining facility where meals can be served to residents." As a  		generic term, however, it most often designates a broader concept. Here, for  		example, is the definition adopted by a 1976 national conference on congregate  		housing for the elderly.</p>
<blockquote><p> Congregate Housing is an assisted independent group living  		  environment that offers the elderly who are functionally impaired or socially  		  deprived, but otherwise in good health, the residential accommodations and  		  supporting services they need to maintain or return to a semi-independent life  		  style and prevent premature or unnecessary institutionalization as they grow  		  older.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since there is no one commonly agreed upon definition of congregate  		housing, it is not easy to distinguish between congregate housing and other  		forms of group living environments (e.g., board and care homes, adult foster  		care). The most apparent distinction involves a subtle shading of ideological  		emphasis. The congregate housing concept emphasizes maximum independence  		through supportive services; more traditional forms emphasize the protective  		care of sheltered group living.</p>
<p>At a minimum, congregate housing/services implies that some meals  		(though usually not all) are shared. Additional services may be required to  		support the continued independence of residents, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Homemaker/chore -- cooking, shopping, housekeeping, laundry, home  			 management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counseling -- guidance in social or emotional problems, financial  			 and legal advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal care services -- bathing, toileting, feeding, other  			 personal maintenance assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health --- some health services by skilled professionals, e.g.,  			 monitoring of condition, changing of dressing, evaluation, physical or speech  			 therapy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Common space for socialization is included in this concept, and most  		proponents see the provision of apartments with some kitchen facilities, rather  		than single rooms, as being essential to maintaining the personal independence  		of residents. These architectural design features distinguish current views of  		congregate housing from the older domiciliary care concept as much as does the  		emphasis on a service package which promotes independence rather than mere  		protection of chronically impaired residents. These distinctions have found  		their way into federal legislation dealing with congregate housing for the  		elderly (for example, 1970 and 1974 housing legislation authorized congregate  		living arrangements in public housing), but the language is restrictive and  		almost solely concerned with provision for group dining facilities. Operating  		funds even for this service are not authorized. By contrast, the 1978  		Congregate Housing Services Act emphasizes basic services within the congregate  		setting for the express purpose of prolonging independence and preventing  		premature institutionalization, and authorizes funds for basic services when  		third-party funds cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>There have been few formal evaluations of congregate housing. However,  		the results of those seem promising.</p>
<p><b>HUD/Urban Systems Report - 1976</b><sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup>: Twenty-seven congregate housing sites were  		studied, representing all regions of the United States, a variety of supported  		and non-supported facilities, a range of rental levels, and differing  		combinations of on-site services. Some key findings were:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Congregate housing fostered the maintenance of independence and an  			 increase in activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congregate housing counters social isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congregate housing appears to provide services and care on an "as  			 needed" basis and thereby is a sensitive service delivery mechanism which  			 allows residents to gauge the appropriate level of ser vices, support, and care  			 that they require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congregate housing facilities financed and developed under the  			 various federal housing finance programs, particularly Section 202 mortgage  			 financing, have had substantially lower development costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congregate housing has not met its full operating costs from  			 operating income, i.e., it has required subsidies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High and medium service congregate housing are cost effective  			 alternatives to some levels of institutional care.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>The Highland Heights Experiment - 1977</b><sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup>: Highland Heights is a specially designed  		14-story apartment house for low-income physically impaired and elderly  		persons. A wide array of social, recreational, and health services is  		available. A five-year study comparing residents to "matched controls" on the  		waiting list found that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Highland Heights residents were significantly less likely to became  			 institutionalized or to die during the study period than the nonresident  			 controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severely impaired persons functionally eligible for nursing home  			 care could function successfully in the Highland Heights community living  			 arrangement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Residency in Highland Heights was economical. Based on a cost  			 savings analysis over a three-year period, the cumulative benefit/cost ratio  			 was 2.21, indicating that the cost of housing and care for the controls was  			 over twice that for Highland Height's residents.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Although congregate housing has been found to be less costly than  		nursing home care for some chronically impaired elderly, very little is known  		about the cost-effectiveness of congregate housing in preventing  		institutionalization compared to home-based services alone or to other forms of  		domiciliary care. Some current and proposed demonstrations address these  		questions. They are described in <a href="#append3-B">Appendix 3-B</a>.</p>
<h3>D. Cross-Cutting Issues </h3>
<h4>Personnel</h4>
<p>The Task Force Work Group on long-term care personnel explored the  		adequacy of current and future supplies of various types of personnel and the  		related issues of training and quality.</p>
<p><b>Supply-Demand Projections</b>: Nursing homes employed about 828,000  		persons in 1976, an increase of 75 percent since 1970. Nursing home employment  		is expected to grow by 73 percent between 1976 and 1985, reaching 1,431,000 in  		1985. This represents a 6.3 percent annual rate of increase.</p>
<p>Nursing home industry employment has the highest ratio of service  		workers and the lowest ratio of professional, technical, and kindred workers of  		all the health industries. Nearly three employees out of four in nursing homes  		are classified as service workers; most of these are health service workers.  		Only about 10 percent of employees are classified as professional or technical  		workers, since the care provided in nursing have generally consists of routine  		tasks considered not to require professional training. The nursing have  		industry has fewer clerical workers and more managers/proprietors than other  		segments of the health economy. This reflects the lower level of paperwork due  		to low turnover of patients and the smaller average size of nursing homes.</p>
<p>Very little change is expected in the occupational distribution of  		nursing home industry employment between 1976 and 1985. The main exception is  		the relative decline of total industry employment expected for professional and  		technical workers (from 13.4 to 10.9 percent of the total). This is consistent  		with the trend to allocate routine tasks to auxiliary workers. This decline is  		expected to be accompanied by an increase in the total percentage of clerical  		workers required for the detailed paperwork required by the growing amount of  		government reimbursement. Detailed projections of the supply and demand for  		selected occupations through 1985 have been canpiled by the Bureau of Labor  		Statistics in conjunction with AoA. Difficulties were experienced in developing  		these estimates. BLS felt that no reliable supply estimates could be made for  		those occupations for which on-the-job training provides many of the entrants  		such as nurse aides and other support personnel. Further, all such projections  		are based upon current patterns of care provision and care providers. There is  		some basis for questioning whether these patterns are the most accurate models  		to use to project future needs. The philosophy of long-term care increasingly  		has been shifting from institutional and custodial management of patients to an  		emphasis on the care of patients in their homes. Such alternate patterns may  		require larger numbers of community health specialists such as geriatric nurse  		specialists, as well as requiring professionals to initiate mechanisms to  		assure quality care under such alternative arrangements.</p>
<p>One recent study focuses strictly on projecting the need for physician  		personnel to provide care for the elderly over the next 50 years. This is the  		Rand study on <b>Geriatrics in the United States: Manpower Projections and  		Training Considerations (May 1980)</b>. Based on a number of assumptions  		regarding the extent of delegation to nurse practitioners and physician's  		assistants, and the age of the population dealt with (75 and older), the report  		makes a summary estimate that the country will require between 7000 and 10,300  		geriatricians by 1990, with the best intermediate estimate being about 8000.  		This is in contrast to score 629 physicians who reported geriatrics as their  		primary, secondary, or tertiary specialty in 1977.</p>
<p><b>Training and Evaluation</b>: The Federal government supports a  		variety of programs which train long-term care personnel. In brief, it appears  		that more attention has been, given to specialized training of health care  		practitioners than to training and education for community social service  		workers. Some, however, argue that it is more appropriate to focus the  		education of health practitioners on the needs of the chronically ill,  		particularly the elderly. The appropriate federal role in this is open to  		question.</p>
<p>In the field of medicine, there has already been some movement toward  		incorporating geriatrics into medical school curricula, according to the Rand  		study on geriatrics. As late as 1976, the Senate Special Committee on Aging  		found that only 3 of 87 schools responding to their survey had established  		geriatrics as a specialty within the curriculm. Based on more recent data, the  		Rand study concludes that:</p>
<blockquote><p> "... by June 1979, a total of 61 U.S. medical schools offered courses  		  in geriatrics, gerontology, or both to medical students. Of these, 4 now  		  mandate a clerkship in geriatric medicine or psychiatry and an additional 4  		  include geriatrics as part of a major clinical clerkship. In addition to these  		  8, another 21 intersperse didactic material in geriatrics or gerontology  		  through the pre-clinical and clinical years as part of other courses. In 55 of  		  the 61 schools, elective courses are offered; most of then are clinical  		  clerkships of one kind or another."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programs for nurses also increasingly emphasize geriatrics. Of some 70  		federally-supported advanced nurse training and nurse practitioner training  		programs, 47 had substantive geriatric content and 23 were specifically  		targeted to gerontology/geriatrics. Overall, more than 1000 nurse practitioners  		have to date been prepared in geriatrics and related fields such as family  		medicine or adult care.</p>
<p><b>Staff Recruitment and Retention</b>: One personnel issue of  		particular concern is the difficulty experienced by nursing homes in attracting  		and keeping staff. A recent California study found that the turnover rate among  		nursing home personnel exceeded 100 percent.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup> Similar results have been reported  		elsewhere. Staff turnover has been variously attributed to such factors as  		"sex, age, marital status, education, salary and benefits, hours and working  		conditions, local demographics, length of employment, personnel practices,  		morale, adequacy of training, attitude towards patients and families." The  		relationship between any of these factors and staff turnover is poorly  		understood. More important, adequate means for solving the problems have not  		been established, though a variety of proposals have been put forward.</p>
<p>Some argue that the key factor is inadequate salaries. It is true that  		there are differences between salaries and benefits in hospitals and nursing  		homes. For example, only 9.2 percent of registered nurses in nursing homes in  		1977 had paid vacations and sick leave, only 11 percent had retirement  		programs, and only 10.8 percent had health or life insurance. By contrast,  		nearly all registered nurses in hospitals had paid vacations, health insurance  		and retirement and most had shift differential pay and paid overtime. Staff  		turnover in hospitals, however, is not much lower for comparable personnel than  		in nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>Quality Assurance</h4>
<p>The Federal government has played an active role in efforts to upgrade  		the quality of care for the LTC population for over a century, though the  		extent of that role has changed as a result of both growing federal financial  		responsibility and changing notions about effective ways of influencing  		quality. During the latter part of the 19th century, the Bureau of the Census  		-- as part of its responsibility to enumerate the numbers of inmates of  		institutions for the blind and "feeble minded" -- conducted a series of  		surveys, the results of which spurred the deinstitutionalization of the blind  		and the establishment of community workshops. In 1927, the Bureau of Labor  		Statistics undertook a complete survey of conditions in all almshouses and  		homes for the aged. The report of that survey, which found that conditions  		varied considerably but that the worst were found in large public almshouses,  		directly contributed to the decision to prohibit Social Security payments to  		inmates of public institutions.</p>
<p>The current federal activities in long-term care quality assurance are  		largely variations on these two historical approaches: (1) conducting and  		supporting research and (2) establishing standards for the receipt of public  		benefits. Research, demonstrations, and training programs constitute a major  		part of the federal effort. But the most visible and controversial activities  		relate to the certification and regulation of nursing homes.</p>
<p>As part of its certification program, the Department develops Conditions  		of Participation which facilities/agencies must meet before they can be  		eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. In order to  		ensure that the standards are met, an annual health and safety survey is  		conducted in each facility/agency by its respective state under a contract with  		the Department. The Department's Regional Offices monitor the States' survey  		process to make certain that standards are being enforced. For Medicare or  		Medicaid facilities, the Federal Regional Offices make the certification  		decision; for Medicaid-only facilities the States certify.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the health and safety survey is to determine  		whether the facility has met the Conditions of Participation and therefore has  		the capacity for providing safe, quality care. In addition, Medicare law  		requires that the appropriate services delivered to patients and quality care  		be assured through a utilization review (UR) committee within a skilled nursing  		facility. Medicaid law specifies a utilization control (UC) program to assure  		quality care. Elements of a UC program include utilization review, physician  		certification and recertification of the need for patient services, and  		individual patient care plans. These quality assurance elements are part of the  		Conditions of Participation and by regulation, have been made common to both  		Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>The Medicaid utilization control program additionally calls for a  		periodic medical review (MR) team in skilled nursing facilities and an  		independent professional review (IPR) team in intermediate care facilities to  		survey a facility at least annually. These inspection teams are composed of  		State employed professionals who are required to review the care being  		provided, the adequacy of the services available to meet current health needs,  		the necessity of continued placement, and the feasibility of alternate care  		arrangements.</p>
<p>PSROs are groups of physicians in 192 areas throughout the country who  		are organized to assure that health care services for Medicare and Medicaid  		patients are of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of  		care, are medically necessary, and are appropriately provided in the most  		economical setting. PSROs have primarily been involved in reviewing care  		setting. PSROs stress physician and provider education as the means to improve  		quality of care.</p>
<p>By law, when PSRDs are found competent to review long-term care  		facilities, PSROs assume responsibility for Medicare UR, and may assume  		responsibility for Medicaid UC, including MP/IPR. However, monitoring UC  		effectiveness remains a state Medicaid agency responsibility regardless of  		whether review authority is assumed by a PSRO or by another agency of the  		state. Assessing the performance of each PSRO is the responsibility of the  		Department's Regional Offices.</p>
<p>The overall effect of all this activity is difficult to assess. There  		have been very few attempts to assess the quality of nursing homes over time  		and to relate these changes to government activities. One study concluded that  		the most important effect has been the "standardization" of facilities, which  		has an uncertain effect on quality.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> Improvements over time have been noted in  		the provision of clean and safe physical environments. Considerable problems,  		however, appear to remain in the assurance of quality care.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> Quality of care objectives are  		more difficult to achieve than custodial goals because there is no well defined  		technology for either producing or evaluating quality care in long-term care  		settings. Some argue that the regulatory methods emphasized to date are  		inappropriate approaches to quality assurance and that other methods --  		including market strategies -- need to be tried.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> The problems which remain with quality  		assurance in institutional settings are sure to be compounded as long-term care  		services are expanded in the community.</p>

<h4>HUD Housing Finance and Rental Assistance  		Programs</h4>
<p><b>Section 202, Housing Act of 1959</b>: "was designed to provide  		'independent living' for elderly and handicapped individuals whose incomes are  		above the public housing income limits but below the level to afford standard  		private sector housing."<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> HUD provided a direct loan to the sponsor  		rather than the mortgage guarantee used in most other HUD programs. The  		mortgage subsidy required the sponsor to charge rents below the market rate.  		The program produced 335 projects with a total of about 45,000 units before it  		was phased out in 1969. The projects were primarily new construction, single  		buildings of medium to high rise, averaging 170 units, predominantly efficiency  		apartments. Most projects include design features to meet the special needs of  		the elderly, but do not accommodate the handicapped.</p>
<p>While most projects are well located in convenient center city  		neighborhoods, the facilities, amenities and services provided within each  		project vary widely.</p>
<p>For example, almost all provide recreational facilities, some provide  		meals and only a few offer medical care, physical therapy, or maid and linen  		services. The wide variation can be attributed to several factors:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Not all projects have appropriate facilities for services  			 provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is disagreement as to the desirability of on-site versus  			 off-site service provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is variation in tenant need or demand for services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service provision is often a function of the ability of the tenant  			 or sponsor to afford them.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>A HUD survey conducted in 1977 of all elderly projects in six selected  		areas showed the frequency with which various services and amenities were  		provided in different types of projects.</p>
<p>The original Section 202 program benefited a select group of the  		elderly. "In accordance with its intent, the program served basically a middle  		income elderly group."<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup> Projects often had a homogenous group of  		white, middle class, mostly female tenants. The tenants reflected the  		neighborhoods in which the projects were located and the sponsors, often  		relatively well-established religious, occupational and fraternal  		organizations. There were few minority group sponsors. The geographic  		distribution was not even, with 71 projects in Florida and California and most  		of the remaining ones in large metropolitan areas in the Northeast and Midwest,  		and did not reflect the distribution of the elderly. There were very few  		projects in rural areas because of a lack of qualified sponsors and high rents  		relative to median income. The program was very popular among sponsors and  		tenants and was well received by the surrounding communities.</p>
<p><b>Section 202/8</b>: The Housing and Community Development Acts of 1974  		and 1978 revised and reactivated the Section 202 program and permit it to serve  		low and very low income populations through coordination with Section 8 housing  		assistance payments. The double subsidy of the mortgage and the rental  		assistance permit a wider economic range of tenants in the projects. The  		Section 8 tenants pay no more than 25 percent of their incomes in rent. Higher  		income tenants may live in the project by paying market rents. The revised  		program includes a mechanism for a more equitable allocation of funds  		geographically, but there is still a shortage of qualified sponsors in rural  		areas. By May, 1980, HUD had reserved funds for 90,000 housing units; 20,319  		had been completed.</p>
<p>"Potential sponsors have expressed a need to coordinate the funding of  		Section 202 housing with that of supportive services provided in those  		projects."<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> For the  		first time, the 1978 amendments authorized HUD to enter into contracts with  		local public housing agencies and project sponsors to provide congregate  		services to eligible project residents. (See discussion below of HUD's  		Congregate Housing Services Program.)</p>
<p>Another significant revision in 1978 set aside $50 million for Section  		202 housing for non-elderly handicapped individuals. The physical facilities as  		well as accompanying services are to be designed specifically to meet the needs  		of the handicapped. Half of the loan authority will be used for demonstration  		(see discussion below).</p>
<p><b>Section 231, Housing Act of 1959</b>: This program was designed to  		provide unsubsidized rental housing for frail but mobile elderly. The program  		insured loans made to profit and nonprofit sponsors. This housing was intended  		to be an alternative to institutionalization in a hospital or nursing home. In  		fact, many projects were "retirement centers," including many life-supporting  		services such as meals, housekeeping, hobby rooms, and full medical care of a  		nursing home level. Program funds went almost exclusively to urban areas. The  		program has 463 projects with about 63,000 units, but has fallen into disuse  		because sponsors prefer other forms of mortgage assistance. Cirtics claim  		Section 231 has a high default or foreclosure rate and that it served a  		relatively high income, low priority population.</p>
<p><b>Section 236E, Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968</b>: From  		1968 until its suspension in 1973, this program was a major source of funds for  		construction of rental and cooperative housing for low and moderate income  		families and the elderly. About 12 percent of the more than 450,000 units  		produced were occupied by the elderly. The program provided a subsidy to the  		mortgage that reduced the effective interest rate paid by the mortgagor to 1  		percent and required low rents. In addition, supplemental rental assistance was  		provided for up to 40 percent of the tenants in a project with incomes too low  		to afford the reduced rent. This rental assistance enabled projects to serve a  		wider economic range than did the original Section 202 program.</p>
<p>Critics claim the program was attractive to speculators and did not  		promote continuous, service-oriented management. In fact, since the subsidy  		only applied to the mortgage payments, rapidly rising operating costs meant  		that rental income was often insufficient to cover both debt service and  		necessary maintenance. "The program was suspended in 1973, amid charges that  		the assistance was not great enough to serve very low income people, the  		program was too expensive and default rates were unacceptably high."<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Public Housing</b>: Low rent public housing is the oldest (since  		1937) and by far the largest program providing housing to poor families and the  		elderly. About 45 percent of the 1,200,000 units are occupied by the elderly  		and most new construction in the last 10 years has been in projects for the  		elderly. Public housing for the elderly is so popular because it is easier to  		manage than family projects and local communities prefer it to family  		projects.</p>
<p>The program is federally financed and locally operated through some 3000  		public housing agencies authorized to acquire, construct, develop or lease real  		property suitable for low income housing. Usually the agency owns and operates  		its projects. Tenants pay no more than 25 percent of their adjusted income for  		rent and at least 20 percent of each project must be occupied by very low  		income tenants, those with incomes 50 percent or less of the area's median.</p>
<p>The 1970 Housing and Urban Development Act provided authority for  		congregate housing. This authority was to be used to pay for dining facilities  		and equipment in low-rent public housing projects. Funds for modernization of  		older projects can also be used to add congregate facilities. No subsidy was  		provided to cover the costs of the meals and other services. There has been  		little development of congregate facilities under this program because:</p>
<ul><li>Tenant selection would be complicated by the requirement to match  		  tenants' housing and service needs and ability to pay with the circumstances of  		  the particular project;</li>
<li>Local housing agencies had little experience managing the necessary  		  services;</li>
<li>There was little federal encouragement and support; and</li>
<li>Assurance of funds to subsidize the services on an ongoing basis does  		  not exist.</li>
</ul><p>It is generally accepted that there will have to be support from State  		and local service agencies if congregate housing is to be implemented  		nationwide.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Section 221(d)(3)</b>: This program operated from 1954 until 1968 and  		provided mortgage insurance for nonprofit, cooperative and limited dividend  		sponsors to develop multifamily rental projects for low and moderate income  		families. In 1961 a Below Market Interest Rate subsidy program was added to  		this section, but was dropped during the housing moratorium in 1973.</p>
<p><b>Section 221(d) (4)</b>: A similar market rate program which provides  		mortgage insurance and 90 percent financing to profit-oriented sponsors, also  		is used to house the elderly.</p>
<p>Relatively few elderly were housed under Section 221(d)(3) until 1964  		when eligibility was expanded to include single elderly individuals. The  		attractiveness of the program was enhanced by the coordinated use of the Rent  		Supplement Program, which was operated similarly to Section 8, but was phased  		out in 1973. In all, about 50,000 units under Section 221(d) (3) and (4) went  		to the elderly.</p>
<p><b>Section 8, Housing and Community Development Act of 1974</b>: Section  		8 provides a rent subsidy to lower and very low income tenants in leased  		housing. The tenant contributes between 15 and 25 percent of his or her income  		toward the rent and the housing assistance payment makes up the difference  		between that and the established rent paid to the owner.</p>
<p>HUD establishes fair market rents and the local housing agency  		administers the program for existing housing units. For new developments and  		Section 202 projects HUD contracts directly with the developer. For newly  		constructed or rehabilitated units for the elderly an extra 5 percent above the  		established fair market rent is granted to the owner. For either existing or  		new housing, the private owner is responsible for managing the unit.</p>
<p>There are several restrictions affecting the distribution of housing  		assistance payments:</p>
<ul><li>20 to 25 percent of the funds must be used in non-metropolitan  		  areas;</li>
<li>30 percent of the units must be rented initially to very low income  		  households, including single persons who are elderly, handicapped, a remaining  		  member of a eligible family, etc.; or</li>
<li>Selection preference is given to <b>family</b> housing projects with  		  not more than 20 percent of the units receiving Section 8 assistance.</li>
</ul><p>That part of the Section 8 program used for existing units has the  		advantage of permitting an elderly renting household to remain in its own  		apartment, to maintain its community contacts but to receive assistance in  		making the rent payments. Early HUD evaluation data show nearly 90 percent of  		funds for Section 8 existing housing has gone to the elderly.</p>
<p>This program reached a peak in service to the elderly in FY 77 with  		nearly two thirds of all commitments for housing assistance for elderly units.  		More than half of the new construction developed in conjunction with Section 8  		rental assistance has been for the elderly. In order to promote more new  		construction in rural areas, the Section 8 program is being coordinated with  		the Farmers Home Administration's Section 515 program (see discussion  		below).</p>
<h4>Farmers Home Administration Housing  		Programs</h4>
<p><b>Farmers Home Administration, Section 502</b>: As shown above, the HUD  		programs have been less successful in rural areas than in metropolitan areas.  		The Farmers Home Administration is better structured administratively to deal  		with rural areas, but its programs are not focused exclusively on the elderly.  		Section 502 provides direct loans to rural low and moderate income families for  		construction, rehabilitation, repairs or the purchase of existing housing. The  		interest rate on the loan is generally below the market rate, but low income  		homeowners may be eligible for an extra interest subsidy. For moderate and  		higher income families unable to obtain a reasonable private loan there is a  		Guaranteed Loan Program. Even though Section 502 has been a large program with  		over 800,000 loans made through FY 78, less than 3 percent of them have gone to  		the elderly. The regulations were recently revised to permit loans for the  		addition of separate, independent living unit to be added onto the family  		dwelling for senior relatives. While the program also has the potential of  		facilitating repairs for elderly homeowners, who have relatively old homes,  		perhaps the financial burden is still too great for many to benefit.</p>
<p><b>Section 504</b>: Direct loans of up to $5,000 are made for home  		repairs necessary to remove health hazards and to make the hate safe and  		sanitary. The terms are 1 percent interest for up to 20 years. Very low income  		homeowners are eligible. The loan can be combined with a grant for an applicant  		62 years old or more with insufficient income to repay the full cost of the  		needed repair. Or a straight grant can be given to an elderly person if  		warranted economically. Often the loans arid grants are used for adding cooking  		or toilet facilities.</p>
<blockquote><p> Since close to 80 percent of the rural elderly own their own houses,  		  the Section 504 program could be of substantial help to them; and indeed, in  		  most years around 60 percent of these loans have been made to the  		  elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Section 515</b>: Initially this program was exclusively for the  		elderly, but legislation in 1966 included families, also. FmHA provides direct  		loans for the construction, purchase or improvement of rental or cooperative  		housing to be occupied by low to moderate income rural families and elderly  		persons. Generally the financing is for multifamily units and may include  		appropriate recreational and service facilities. Project sponsors include  		individuals, consumer cooperatives, State or local public agencies, limited  		partnerships and profit or nonprofit corporations. Loan terms include: an  		interest subsidy which can reduce the effective interest rate of 1 percent for  		nonprofit sponsors, the regular FmHA interest rate for profit-oriented  		sponsors, and a repayment period of 40 years or 50 years for projects specially  		designed for the elderly. About 63 percent for the units have been for the  		elderly. This Section is being used for the FmHA congregate housing  		program.</p>
<p>The rents required under this program, even with the interest subsidy,  		would be more than 25 percent of income for most elderly renters, so Congress  		in 1974 authorized special rental assistance payments. FmHA preferred to use  		HUD's Section 8 program. Critics claim that coordination between the two  		agencies was slow initially and is more cumbersome than if the loan and rental  		assistance programs were run by the same department.</p>
<h4>Nursing Home Programs</h4>
<p><b>Section 232, Housing Act of 1959</b>: This program provides insurance  		for mortgages of up to forty years for private nonprofit or for-profit sponsors  		to build or rehabilitate nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. Loan  		insurance is also provided for the installation of fire safety equipment.  		Projects may be a single health care facility or may include a combination of  		related facilities, but <b>not</b> hospitals, clinics, diagnostic or treatment  		centers or homes for the aging. Occupancy is not limited by age, but is  		restricted to individuals needing SNF/ICF care. 1,241 project have been  		supported by this program and provide 141,505 beds.</p>
<p><b>Hill Burton</b>: Unlike the HUD program to finance nursing homes, the  		HEW program provided grants as well as loans, but only to nonprofit and public  		sponsors. From 1956-1976, the Hill Burton programs contributed $209,708,178 in  		grants for 606 nursing home projects which provided 43,120 beds. (A single  		nursing home facility, over a period of time, could have more than one Hill  		Burton project.) From 1972-1976, direct loans were available to public sponsors  		and guaranteed loans to private, non-profit sponsors. A total of thirty  		projects supported the construction, addition or modernization of 2,992  		long-term care beds, either in free-standing nursing homes or in long-term care  		facilities attached to general hospitals. There were six direct loans totalling  		$5,355,000 for 317 beds. Most of the assistance, $38,957,086 went as loan  		guarantees to 24 private projects for 2,675 beds.</p>
<h4>Congregate Housing Program</h4>
<p><b>HUD's Congregate Housing Services Programs</b>: In 1978 Congress  		recognized the limitations in HUD's bricks and mortar approach to meeting the  		housing needs of the elderly and the lack of coordination between the housing  		programs and essential social services. It authorized HUD to make 3-5 year  		grants to Public Housing Agencies and Section 202 borrowers under which they  		can then fund a package of services, including meals, personal assistance and  		housekeeping, for their eligible elderly and handicapped residents. Initially,  		a renewable 4-year program of 3-5 year grants was authorized at $120,000,000.  		Actual appropriations in FY 79 and FY 80 were $10,000,000 each.</p>
<p>In 1979, 38 projects were funded -- 28 in public housing, 10 in section  		202 housing. The local housing agency or housing sponsor will receive funds up  		to $100,000 per year for 3 years to provide (or subcontract for) services  		including at least 2 meals per day, 7 days per week and other services  		determined by a Professional Assessment Committee to be needed by the  		residents. The PAC must have a medical professional and at least two other  		members, who can be representatives of the residents' organization of the  		project as well as representatives of state and local programs for the aged  		and/or handicapped. Only 20 percent of project residents are eligible for the  		whole package of services, although all can participate in the meals at cost.  		The 20 percent limit will be waived for existing housing and very small  		projects. In 1980, about 20 projects will receive 5-year grants with a maximum  		of $80,000 annually.</p>
<p>Program priorities will place about 80 percent of the service funds in  		existing housing projects rather than with new construction. The elderly will  		receive about 80 percent of the funds, the rest will go to the non-elderly  		handicapped.</p>
<p>HUD will conduct a thorough evaluation of this program to determine,  		among other things:</p>
<ul><li>Its efficiency and effectiveness;</li>
<li>Its success in preventing unnecessary institutionalization;</li>
<li>The extent to which HUD/HHS coordination is achieved; and</li>
<li>The extent to which the program avoids or duplicates existing  		  programs.</li>
</ul><h4>Congregate Housing Demonstration</h4>
<p><b>Farmers Home Administration in coordination with the Administration  		on Aging</b> is supporting congregate housing demonstration at 10 diverse  		sites. Projects are under development now and will begin to open for occupancy  		shortly. The projects average about 35-45 units each. The model facilities  		carbine Section 515 loans with Section 8 rental assistance and AOA  		non-renewable grants of $2.5 million for 3 years.</p>
<p>At a minimum the project must provide: full or partial meal service,  		housekeeping and personal care services, transportation, and social and  		recreational activities. The purpose of the grant is to support a project  		director at each site who will seek community support for necessary services  		and to ensure their continuation beyond the grant period, provide outreach to  		the community, and help match the project design with the housing and service  		needs of the local elderly.</p>
<h4>HUD Program for Deinstitutionalization of  		the Chronically Mentally Ill</h4>
<p>This program was initiated in 1978 and is now operating in 39 States.  		The demonstration uses direct loan authority reserved under Section 202 in  		conjuction with a set aside of Section 8 funds to cover 100 percent of the  		approximately 2,000 units to be constructed or rehabilitated. Small, scattered  		site projects, such as group homes for 12 or fewer chronically mentally ill  		individuals or independent living complexes of 6-10 apartment units for no more  		than 20 individuals are the norm. Eligible residents include individuals 18  		years or older with severe and persistent emotional or mental disorders which  		limit their functional capacities, but could be improved by more suitable  		housing conditions. Alcohol and drug addicts are not included. State social  		service agencies select appropriate residents.</p>
<p>In addition to selecting residents, States are expected to coordinate  		implementation of the program with sponsors and appropriate State and local  		supportive services. No HUD funds are available for those services. The State  		can apply to HHS for Section 1115 waivers on behalf of project sponsors to  		permit a more flexible use of supportive services.</p>
<h2><a name="wp4" id="wp4">WORKING PAPER #4: PROGRAMS AND FINANCING FOR LONG-TERM  		CARE SERVICES</a></h2>
<h3>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>Increases in the public cost of long-term care in recent years have been  		phenanenal:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Medicaid nursing home expenditures rose 22 percent per year from  			 1974 to 1978.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicare home health expenditures rose 44.6 percent per year from  			 1975 to 1979.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In a time of rapidly increasing costs and scarce resources, an  		understanding of who pays how much, for what services, and for whom is  		essential. This paper provides a review of the present system and key financing  		issues.</p>
<p>A full discussion of current long-term care financing would have to take  		into account a very wide variety of public and private sources of funding for  		services to the chronically disabled; by one count, there are at least 80  		Federal programs which benefit all elderly (both disabled and non-disabled)  		either directly or indirectly through cash assistance, in-kind transfers, or  		the direct provision of goods and services.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> Another source lists 150 federal programs  		which assist the handicapped by providing health, education, rehabilitation,  		income and housing.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup>  		Since the range of services which provide assistance to the chronically  		disabled is broad, it is difficult to isolate how much is actually spent on  		long-term care from all sources. Further, without a more specific delineation  		of the services which should be considered long-term care, financing issues are  		not easily addressed in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>A review of the financing of long-term care is further complicated by  		the fact that many of the federal programs which fund the provision of  		long-term care services have not been exclusively designed to support services  		for the chronically disabled, apart from other needy population groups. In  		fact, discussions of the financing problems in long-term care frequently center  		on the inability of current programs, as they are presently organized, to meet  		the particular needs of individuals with chronic disabilities.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Given these constraints, the following pages focus on those aspects of  		long-term care financing considered most salient by the Task Force: the  		relative roles of the public and private sectors in funding of services; the  		types of services covered and their coordination under major federal funding  		programs; and eligibility for Federally-financed long-term care services.</p>
<p>As background information, a brief summary description of selected  		federal programs which provide support for long-term care is provided in the  		accompanying appendices.</p>
<h3>B. Public and Private Roles in Long-Term Care  		Financing</h3>
<p>A central issue in the development of long-term care policy is the  		appropriate allocation of responsibility between public and private sources for  		financing services for the chronically disabled. This section examines the  		existing public/private role in financing long-term care, including the  		development of Federal programs and trends in public vs. private support of  		long-term care.</p>
<h4>Federal Long-Term Care Programs</h4>
<p>Although it is popularly believed that public financing of long-term  		care is a relatively recent phenomenon, there has always been a significant  		public role in supporting care of the chronically disabled. Colonial American  		communities, for example, appropriated substantial funds for the foster care of  		disabled persons without families or resources. Prior to 1935, however,  		government support was largely a state and local matter.</p>
<p>Expansion of the scope of Federal responsibility for the aged and  		disabled dates from the establishment of Federal matching grants to the States  		for Old Age Assistance and Aid to the Blind in Titles I and X, respectively, of  		the Social Security Act of 1935. These pension programs for the elderly and  		blind provided many with the means to purchase room, board and services in  		private boarding homes, rest homes and homes for the aged. Because benefit  		payments under these programs were forbidden to "inmates of public  		institutions," a pattern was established under which beneficiaries of public  		funding programs purchased services primarily from private providers.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Title II of the original Social Security Act established the program of  		social insurance retirement benefits based on employee and employer  		contributions, now commonly referred to as "social security." In 1956, this  		program of social insurance benefits was extended to severely disabled workers  		and adult disabled children of deceased and retired workers. Amendments in 1960  		and 1967 broadened the definitions of disability and the conditions under which  		an individual can became eligible for disability insurance benefits.</p>
<p>Payment patterns to institutions under the matching grants for old age  		assistance and aid to the blind have changed over the years as well. Amendments  		to the Social Security Act in 1950 repealed the prohibition against payments to  		residents of public institutions, and also permitted direct payments (called  		vendor payments) to providers of nursing care, in addition to beneficiary  		payments. Dramatic growth in vendor payments to nursing homes occurred in 1960  		as a result of the Kerr-Mills program, with payments increasing almost ten  		times by 1965.</p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid program (Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social  		Security Act), established in 1965, provided health insurance to aged and low  		income individuals for a broad range of health-oriented long-term care services  		in a variety of institutional and noninstitutional settings. Funding for  		nursing home services incorporated many of the features of the Kerr-Mills  		program. Under Medicare and Medicaid, vendor payments provided with federal  		matching funds were made available to facilities offering extended care  		(Medicare) and skilled nursing services (Medicaid). These services, however,  		were defined primarily as health rather than custodial care. Under Medicare,  		payments were to be made only for a period of post hospital convalescence,  		provided that skilled nursing services were required. Medicaid, as an expanded  		version of the Kerr-Mills program, continued the provision of federal matching  		funds on a vendor-payment basis for skilled nursing services to cash assistance  		recipients and, in some states, to the medically indigent.</p>
<p>A definition of the skilled nursing services benefit was not included in  		the original Medicaid legislation. Interim Medicaid standards adopted in 1967  		relied on existing state standards, developed under the Kerr-Mills program. To  		broaden the types of facilities eligible for reimbursement in states  		participating in Medicaid, vendor payments for a lower skilled level of care  		within intermediate care facilities (ICF) were initiated in 1967 under Title XI  		of the Social Security Act. In 1971, funding for ICF care was transferred to  		Medicaid.</p>
<p>Intermediate care (under Title XI) was initially defined by the states  		to include facilities providing more than room and board, but less than skilled  		nursing care. The Medicaid definition of facilities offering this level of care  		called for the provision of health related care to individuals who did not  		require hospital or skilled nursing services, but who required care which could  		only be made available through institutional services. Subsequent legislative  		action has further refined the definition of skilled and intermediate levels of  		care and the conditions under which these services should be offered.</p>
<p>In addition to providing expanded coverage for nursing home care, the  		Medicare and Medicaid programs extended funding for have health services.  		Medicare home health benefits include part-time or intermittent nursing care;  		physical, occupational or speech therapy; medical social services; part-time or  		intermittent home health aide services; medical supplies; and in some cases  		hospital-based medical services. Originally an optional benefit under Medicaid,  		home health services became a required benefit in 1970. There is no legislative  		definition of home health services in the Medicaid legislation. Most states  		fund services which are similar to those provided under Medicare, although  		specific criteria for service eligibility are slightly broader.</p>
<p>In 1965, another law was passed which provided for public funding of  		long-term care services, the Older Americans Act. The purpose of the programs  		funded under this legislation has been to enable older persons to live in their  		own homes as independently as possible. Emphasis is placed on the planning,  		coordination and development of services. Funding is also provided for the  		direct delivery of services such as meals, chore services, home repair and  		transportation.</p>
<p>An additional component of the evolving federal role related to funding  		of long-term care services is the Title XX program. Developed as part of the  		1975 amendments to the Social Security Act, Title XX consolidates funding for  		social service programs from various titles within the Social Security Act. The  		program operates as a grant-in-aid program under which states are able to  		provide a range of social services to population groups determined to be  		eligible under federal and state criteria. Services made available vary by  		state and include a number of home-based and community services.</p>
<p>Other federal programs provide funding for long-term care services both  		directly and indirectly. For instance, the Veterans Administration supports a  		comprehensive program of long-term care benefits for veterans, and the,  		Department of Housing and Urban Development operates programs which provide  		housing assistance to the elderly and the disabled. Taken together, these  		programs represent a major commitment to financing long-term care. The exact  		magnitude of that commitment, however, cannot be determined at this time.</p>
<h4>Public and Private Expenditures</h4>
<p><a href="#table4-I">Table I</a> summarizes the total expenditures under  		the major federal programs which finance long-term care services. It is not  		possible to isolate the extent of long-term care spending from these data.  		Proportional spending for various types of services can be obtained, but  		relative spending for services directed specifically towards the long-term care  		population is not known.</p>
<p>For example, the figures in <a href="#table4-I">Table I</a> show that  		the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) program represents the largest  		category of Federal expenditures compared with the other programs shown. Not  		all OASI beneficiaries, however, are disabled by chronic conditions. Of those  		who are, many probably rely on the social security insurance benefits to  		purchase certain long-term care services. As another example, both persons who  		are and those who are not chronically disabled obtain funding for health  		services from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.</p>
<p>It is even more difficult to assign a dollar figure to <b>total</b>  		private spending for LTC than to public support, for two reasons: existing data  		collection systems are oriented towards Federal and State programs rather than  		private sources and a significant source of long-term care is services provided  		to disabled individuals by friends and family, the costs of which are usually  		hidden because they are not translated into money transactions.</p>

Private payments for nursing home  		care were 65 percent of all payments in 1965. As shown in <a href="#table4-II">Table II</a>, the private proportion of nursing home care  		costs in relation to public expenditures declined steadily until the mid-70's,  		but has remained relatively stable at 42-43 percent in recent years.</p>

</tr></table><p>Growth in public expenditures has occurred both because of an increase  		in the number of persons receiving benefits under public programs, and because  		of increases in payments per recipient. Between 1973 and 1977, the Medicaid  		program has accounted for between 78-85 percent of all public expenditures for  		nursing have care. As indicated in <a href="#table4-II">Table II</a>, Medicaid  		expenditures for nursing have care more than doubled in the four years between  		1973 and 1977. This was due in part to an average annual increase in payments  		per recipient of over 15 percent. In real terms, Medicaid payments grew 48  		percent over this period, relative to real growth in private expenditures of  		only 10 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>This inflation in the nursing home sector (along with even more rapid  		inflation in home health services) has serious implications for the public and  		private role in financing long-term care. First, more rapid inflation in  		nursing home services than in the general economy means fewer people can pay  		for services privately, placing increasing pressure on public budgets. Rapidly  		increasing costs increase the rates at which individuals exhaust private  		resources and increase the probability that Medicaid will have to pay the  		nursing home bill. Also, available data indicate that although nursing have  		care costs per resident were approximately $8,011 in 1975, average per capita  		income for those over 65 was only $5,349. While the majority of nursing have  		patients initially use private funds, a substantial proportion convert to  		public sources of payment after exhausting personal resources during the first  		year.</p>
<p>This diminution of private ability to finance LTC services is a matter  		of serious concern; to the extent that the public nursing home bill absorbs  		additional resources, it will be more difficult to target funds on alternatives  		to nursing home care and other possible system changes.</p>
<h3>C. Coverage and Coordination of LTC Programs</h3>
<p>In order to begin to identify needs for long-term care policy change, it  		is necessary to understand certain key characteristics of the present group of  		programs which finance long-term care--specifically,</p>
<ul><li>what is the range of types of services covered;</li>
<li>do program design requirements pranote or inhibit coordination of  		  services to meet individual needs?</li>
</ul><p>These questions are addressed in this section. </p>
<h4>Range of Services Covered</h4>
<p>As shown in <a href="#table4-III">Table III</a>, selected major Federal  		long-term care programs address each of the three identified types of services:  		illness/disability services; mobility assistance/basic living; and personal  		care. However, the extent to which specific services are available in a variety  		of settings and the types of services supported within these broad categories  		is less clear.</p>
<p>The categories incorporate less skilled assistance provided in the bane  		as well as formally organized services offered in specialized settings. Meals,  		for example, can be delivered to community residences or can be provided in  		congregate dining facilities. Monitoring, as another example, can include  		sitter services, respite care or check-in systems. It can also be part of the  		services automatically provided in group homes or nursing homes. Alternatively,  		some programs limit services to specific settings; Medicaid does pay for  		housing, meals, and housekeeping in nursing homes, but does not reimburse these  		services for individuals living in the community.</p>
<p>In principle, a comprehensive range of services is covered by Federal  		programs. In practice, actual coverage is determined by level of funding and  		program design features discussed below.</p>
<p>Two conclusions which have frequently been drawn in the long-term care  		literature are that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Spending for health services is much greater than spending for  			 social services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spending for nursing home care is substantially larger than spending  			 for home health and home-based chore services.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some evidence can be cited in support of those conclusions. For example,  		total federal expenditures specifically allocated for nursing home care were  		over ten times the expenditures specifically allocated for have health in 1978.  		Further, the entire federal share of Title XX, including the costs of all  		social programs, was only about half of the federal share of nursing home costs  		in the same year. Nevertheless, the conclusions commonly drawn from such  		isolated facts cannot be easily substantiated.</p>

</tr></table><p>One problem is that the indirect use of public dollars provided through  		the social security program for long-term care services in institutional or  		community settings cannot be calculated. Further, some services financed under  		health care programs are actually "basic living services." For example, money  		spent on nursing home care pays for food and housing as well as nursing. How  		much of the nursing have bill should then be attributed to "social service"  		expenditures? As a further example, more federal money was spent in 1978 on  		Disability Insurance than on nursing home care (<a href="#table4-I">Table  		I</a>). Presumably the recipients spent much of this on "basic living  		services." Finally, the extent to which the patterns of expenditure are  		appropriate is difficult to judge without more detailed analyses of population  		needs and service effectiveness.</p>
<h4>Coordination of Long-Term Care Programs</h4>
<p>Since no single program funds a comprehensive array of long-term care  		services, the effectiveness of coordination across programs is a central issue  		in the consideration of policy change. Individual program service definitions,  		design of benefits, and interrelationships between eligibility requirements,  		all have implications for the appropriateness of services to individuals and  		cost-effectiveness of a long-term care system.</p>
<p>With respect to service definitions, some obvious inefficiencies are  		created by differences in the way programs define, for reimbursement purposes,  		what would appear to be the same basic service. For example, the sane provider  		might offer homemaker/health aide services under Medicare, Medicaid, and Title  		XX but allowable service components and charges will differ. Some have noted  		that, as a result, services offered within a broad category (e.g., home health  		care) are tailored to Federal/State program definitions rather than individual  		need.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Other program design requirements may, also have adverse consequences  		for access to services. For example, since Medicare requires that have health  		agencies provide skilled nursing care and at least one other therapeutic  		service, home health agencies in certain rural areas which are not able to  		recruit specialized personnel are not able to receive Medicare  		funding.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Improving long-term care program coordination at the Federal, State, and  		local levels has long been sought by the Department of Health and Human  		Services. However, the success of coordination efforts has been limited by the  		inherent difficulty in achieving a balance between uniformity in service  		definitions, standards and/or reimbursement procedures and flexibility at the  		local level to enable service providers to respond to particular needs.</p>
<h3>D. Eligibility</h3>
<h4>General Principles</h4>
<p>The various principles underlying eligibility for major DHHS programs  		which fund long-term care services may be derived from <a href="#table4-IV">Table IV</a>. As can be seen, eligibility is variously  		defined by age (Medicare, Old Age and Survivors Insurance, Title XX, SSI),  		condition (Medicare, Disability Insurance, SSI) or a combination (e.g.,  		Medicaid ICF/MR). The income standards used by each state to determine  		eligibility for these latter programs are highly variable.</p>
<p>The use of age, and particularly age 65 as a criterion for long-term  		care benefits is increasingly being challenged. Although a greater proportion  		of elderly persons compared to other age groups require long-term care  		services, there are more young people than elderly in the long-term care  		population. Further, the use of any particular age as a criterion for service  		eligibility is arbitrary since at any age there will be, needy persons who will  		be too young to qualify for benefits.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, some believe that more efficient targeting of services  		within older age groups is essential. Two recent reports have recommended that  		the focus of long-term care service delivery should center around those who are  		75 and over, the so-called "frail elderly."<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup> As the House Select Committee on Aging has  		noted:</p>
<blockquote><p> It is our contention that if this country attempts to serve all  		  seniors equally through its fragile Aging Network, it will actually be able to  		  serve only a few, and not very well at that. Our policy must realize that those  		  truly in need--the 75+ population -- have first rights and must be the focus of  		  future aging policy.<sup><font><a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others have urged that entitlement for services be determined on the  		basis of functional disability rather than age, recognizing that current  		instruments for measuring levels of functional impairment or limitation need to  		be further developed.<sup><font><a href="#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>More general discussions have focused on the issue of universal  		entitlement with sliding fees (based on age or other criteria) vs. income-based  		services eligibility. Both means of eligibility determination are currently  		used in Federal programs. Debate has centered around expanding the role of one  		or the other method for financing particular services or services delivered in  		particular settings. To some, long-term care services are be entitled and which  		public financing programs should be expanded to cover, wholly or on a sliding  		fee basis.<sup><font><a href="#note43">43</a></font></sup> Others  		argue that for the most part, public funding for long-term care services should  		be reserved for those who are least able to obtain these services because of  		low income.<sup><font><a href="#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another area of debate has focused on the income levels which are most  		appropriate in determining income-based eligibility. For example, the  		variability in income standards employed by different states for Medicaid  		demonstrates that there is no clear consensus on the level of income below  		which public assistance should be provided.<sup><font><a href="#note45">45</a></font></sup> Proposals have been made to establish  		minimum "floors" to which all states must adhere. To date, however, none of  		these proposals has been adopted for program funding related to long-term care  		services, with the exception of the Supplemental Security Income program.</p>

</tr></table><h4>Variations in Eligibility</h4>
<p>Not only do the different Federal programs provide funding for a varying  		scope of long-term care services, and for different types of particular  		services, but eligibility requirements vary so that the same individual may  		have access to one needed service and not another. To make the situation even  		more complicated, eligibility for certain services can differ by state or  		community within single programs; for example, in some states, counties  		determine service eligibility criteria for the Title XX program, and  		eligibility for Medicaid varies greatly from state to state.  		<a href="#table4-V">Table V</a> presents examples of variation in eligibility  		standards among selected. states for similar services.</p>
<p>As a consequence of such disparities, an individual who is eligible for  		long-term care social services under Title XX may not qualify for long-term  		care health benefits under Medicaid. These different eligibility criteria  		reflect basic strategies and purposes inherent in the various Federal  		programs.</p>

</tr></table><p>In some cases, the fact that some are eligible for public funding for  		certain services and not for others may present no difficulties because these  		individuals may be able to pay for services on their own. In other situations,  		the result may be an unmet need for particular types of long-term care.  		Numerous studies have shown that clear differences in services utilization can  		be seen between eligible and non-eligible groups of individuals.<sup><font><a href="#note46">46</a></font></sup> Given current data, however, it is not  		possible to determine the full extent to which appropriate levels of long-term  		care services utilization have been reduced by present eligibility  		standards.</p>
<p>A related issue is whether limits on eligibility for federally-funded  		long-term care bias the utilization of types of services. Discussions on this  		topic have focused particularly on eligibility requirements for nursing homes  		and have health services under federal funding programs.</p>
<p>With regard to eligibility for nursing have services, it is argued that  		eligibility policies in the Medicaid and SSI programs create financial  		incentives for persons to enter nursing homes rather than remain within the  		community.<sup><font><a href="#note47">47</a></font></sup> There are  		various ways in which an individual can become eligible for Medicaid benefits  		in nursing homes while not being eligible for these benefits in the  		community:</p>
<ul><li>in states with medically-needy programs, or "spend down" provisions  		  of Medicaid, individuals may qualify for Medicaid in nursing homes because the  		  cost of their basic living needs is considered a "medical" expense <b>and</b>  		  depletes their income more rapidly;<sup><font><a href="#note48">48</a></font></sup> and</li>
<li>in 15 states without medically needy programs, some individuals may  		  receive Medicaid benefits in nursing homes but not in the community because  		  income levels for Medicaid eligibility for outpatient care are more  		  restrictive.<sup><font><a href="#note49">49</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Long-term care eligibility requirements may inhibit family care of the  		disabled individual to an unknown extent. Program requirements which could have  		this effect include, e.g.:</p>
<ul><li>a dependent or spouse living with relatives may have a family income  		  level which is too high to qualify the individual for Medicaid. When  		  institutionalized, however, this same individual would became independently  		  eligible for benefits; and</li>
<li>cash support and Medicaid coverage is reduced if an individual lives  		  with or receives support from family or friends who have no legal obligation to  		  provide such support.</li>
</ul><p>A second major area of concern pertains to eligibility standards for  		home health services.<sup><font><a href="#note50">50</a></font></sup>  		Under current Medicare law, eligibility for home health services is extended  		only to individuals who are homebound, who have a primary need for "skilled"  		nursing care and who require these services on a part time or intermittent  		basis. In many states, Medicaid programs apply the same eligibility  		requirements. Eligibility procedures and the scope of in-home services under  		Title XX vary by state. By law, in-home services under Title XX are directed  		more to social service needs than to health needs.</p>
<p>Numerous proposals have been put forth to expand the criteria for have  		health services eligibility. One major criticism of current program definitions  		of home health services eligibility is that they do not realistically cover the  		situations under which many individuals require such services. The Task Force  		has begun to examine these and other issues related to eligibility standards,  		eligibility determinations and the treatment of income and assets. Some states  		have also begun to reform their policies in this area. Continued work will be  		necessary to resolve questions of cost, appropriateness, and equity.</p>

<h4>SOCIAL SECURITY (Social Security Administration, DHHS)</h4>
<p>The Social Security Act, initially passed in 1935, is the foundation  		upon which most federal income assistance and services assistance programs are  		based. Persons eligible for monthly social security cash benefits include:</p>
<ul><li>Disabled insured workers under age 65.</li>
<li>Retired insured workers age 62 or over.</li>
<li>Spouses of retired or disabled workers entitled to benefits who:
<ol><li>Are age 62 or over; or</li>
<li>Have in their care the worker's child who is under 18 and  				entitled to social security benefits.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Divorced spouses (in some cases) of retired or disabled workers  		  entitled to benefits if age 62 or over and married to the worker for at least  		  20 years. For benefits payable after 1978, the 20 years is reduced to 10  		  years.</li>
<li>Dependent, unmarried children of retired or disabled workers entitled  		  to benefits, or of deceased insured workers if the child is:
<ol><li>Under age 18;</li>
<li>Age 18 or over but under a disability which began before age 22;  				or</li>
<li>Age 18 - 21 and attending school full time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Surviving spouses (including a surviving divorced wife in some cases)  		  of deceased insured workers if the widow or widower is age 50 - 59 and becomes  		  disabled within the period specified in the law.</li>
<li>Surviving spouses (including the surviving divorced spouse in some  		  cases) of deceased insured workers, regardless of age, if they have in their  		  care an entitled child of the deceased who is under 18 or disabled.</li>
<li>Dependent parents of deceased insured workers age 62 or over.</li>
</ul><p>The primary insurance amount paid to beneficiaries is calculated as on  		the basis of average wages earned.</p>
<p>In November, 1980, average Social Security benefits were:</p>
<ul><li>$333 a month for a retired worker alone</li>
<li>$567 a month for a retired worker and spouse</li>
<li>$311 a month for a aged widow</li>
<li>$355 a month for a disabled worker</li>
<li>$728 a month for a disabled worker, with spouse and one or more  		  children.</li>
</ul><h4>OLD AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE (OASI)(Social Security  		Administration, DHHS)</h4>
<p>The Old Age and Survivors Insurance Program (Title II of the Social  		Security Act) is the retirement insurance benefit program established in 1935  		under the Social Security Act. For workers with sufficient quarters of  		coverage, full retirement benefits are paid at age 65, or at the worker's  		option, permanently reduced benefits may begin at age 62. Additional benefits  		are provided to the dependents of retired workers. Survivor benefits are also  		provided to dependents of deceased workers.</p>
<p>As with disability insurance, benefits are determined on the basis of  		average covered earnings.</p>
<h4>DISABILITY INSURANCE (DI) (Social Security Administration,  		DHHS)</h4>
<p>The Disability Insurance Program (Title II of the Social Security Act)  		began in 1957 as a Federal program of cash benefits for totally disabled  		workers. For those workers who have sufficient quarters in covered employment,  		eligibility for benefits is based on inability to engage in any substantial  		gainful activity, as determined by the monetary level of income earned.</p>
<p>Disability must be caused by a medically determinable physical or mental  		impairment that has lasted or is expected to last at least 12 months or to  		result in death. Determinations of disability are made on the basis of the  		medical severity of the impairment as indicated by clinical and laboratory  		findings. Eligibility is also extended to the dependents of workers found to be  		disabled.</p>
<p>The states through designated agencies have responsibility for making  		determinations of eligibility for disability benefits.</p>
<h4>SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME (SSI) (Social Security Administration,  		DHHS)</h4>
<p>The Supplemental Security Income Program (Title XVI of the Social  		Security Act) was initiated in 1974 as an income and resource-tested income  		maintenance program for the needy aged, blind and disabled. The SSI program  		replaced and consolidated earlier Federal matching grant adult assistance  		programs. Eligibility for SSI benefits includes all persons who are aged, blind  		or disabled who meet the standard for low income. As in the Disability  		Insurance program, disabled persons are defined as those unable to engage in  		any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable  		impairment.</p>
<p>Benefits provided to individuals are based on the amount of other income  		received, including earned and unearned income. Higher payments (one and a half  		times the amount for an individual) are made to couples if both spouses are  		either aged, blind or disabled.</p>
<p>As of July 1980, minimum guaranteed incomes under SSI are $238 a month  		for an individual and $357 a month for a couple, assuming SSI program  		requirements are met. In addition, states may provide supplementary payments  		for various types of special living arrangements, including congregate care or  		personal care.</p>
<h4>MEDICARE (Health Care Financing Administration, DHHS)</h4>
<p>The Medicare Program (Tile XVIII of the Social Security Act) began in  		1966 as a Federal health insurance program for Social Security beneficiaries  		who are 65 years of age and older. In addition to these beneficiaries,  		eligibility for Mediare benefits now includes persons who are permanently  		disabled (receiving disability insurance benefits), dependents of the  		permanently disabled and persons suffering from end-stage renal disease.</p>
<p>The program has two separate but coordinated parts:</p>
<ul><li>Hospital insurance (Part A) -- covers inpatient hospital services;  		  which may include semi-private room, meals, regular nursing services, operating  		  room, special care units, drugs and medical supplies, laboratory tests, and  		  rehabilitation services; extended care in a skilled nursing facility; and  		  services in the home through a participating home health agency.</li>
<li>Supplementary medical insurance (Part B) - optional coverage for  		  those choosing to enroll -- covers physicians' services, outpatient hospital  		  services, diagnostic tests, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology  		  services, medical equipment and supplies, and home health services.</li>
</ul><h4>MEDICAID (Health Care Financing Administration, DHHS)</h4>
<p>The Medicaid Program (Title XIX of the Social Security Act) began in  		1966 as a joint Federal-state program to provide medical assistance to persons  		with low income, including the aged, blind and disabled. Eligibility for  		Medicaid benefits extends at a minimum to all persons receiving cash assistance  		under various welfare programs (Aid to Families with Dependent Children and,  		with certain exceptions, Supplementary Security Income). About half of the  		states have opted to provide benefits to other low-income persons such as the  		"medically needy," those whose incomes are too high to qualify then for  		welfare, but too low to cover their medical expenses. (For persons in the  		community, but not in nursing homes; income levels can extend up to 133 percent  		of the state's AFDC grant adjusted for family size. For persons in nursing  		homes, income levels can be set up to 300 percent of the SSI payment  		standard.)</p>
<p>The program is administered by 49 of the states with Federal matching  		grants determined on the basis of state per capita income. The average Federal  		share of state Medicaid costs is 55 percent.</p>
<p>Services provided under Medicaid include:</p>
<ul><li>Required services -- physician, hospital and skilled nursing home  		  care; health screenings and followup treatment for children; laboratory and  		  X-ray services; home health care services; family planning services; and rural  		  health clinic services.</li>
<li>Optional services -- dental care, eyeglasses, clinic services,  		  prescribed drugs, care in an intermediate care facility and services by  		  optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors.</li>
</ul><h4>OLDER AMERICANS ACT (Administration on Aging, DIMS)</h4>
<p>The Older Americans Act, initially passed. in 1965, was designed to  		encourage the development of comprehensive and coordinated social service  		systems for the elderly. Under this legislation, a network of area-wide  		agencies on aging has responsibility for planning and funding the provision of  		a broad range of social services. Eligibility for services under the Act is  		extended to all persons 60 or over, without regard to income.</p>
<p>A major focus of the program is the planning and coordination of  		services, including health, housing, labor, transportation, and social  		services. Direct services provided under the Act are, in-home services,  		congregate meals, residential repair and renovation, legal services,  		transportation, information and referral, escort and outreach services.  		Particular services available in given communities depend on funding available  		and locally determined service priorities.</p>
<h4>TITLE XX (Office of Human Development Services, DHHS)</h4>
<p>Social service programs funded under the Social Security Act were  		consolidated into Title XX in 1975. This program serves as a grant-in-aid  		program under which states are able to provide a range of social services to  		population groups determined to be eligible. Eligibility for services,  		determined at the state level, is typically based on income requirements  		although certain services (protective services, family planning and  		information/referral) may be provided universally. At least half of the  		population served under Title XX must be low income. Close to half (48%) of all  		Title XX resources in 1979 were provided to persons participating in the AFDC  		and SSI programs.</p>
<p>Title XX funds are distributed to the states as block grants on the  		basis of population. For all services except family planning and child day  		care, states are required to provide 25 percent matching. Total Title XX  		expenditures are currently limited by a permanent ceiling.</p>
<p>Services provided under Title XX vary by state. The general goals to  		which services must be addressed, by legislation, include:</p>
<ul><li>self support;</li>
<li>self sufficiency;</li>
<li>protection of children and vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect, or  		  exploitation, and strengthening family life;</li>
<li>prevention or reduction of inappropriate institutional care by  		  providing for community-based care, home-based care, or other forms of less  		  intensive care; and</li>
<li>provision of institutional care when appropriate, and services to  		  individuals in institutions.</li>
</ul><p>Services provided can include home health aide services, homemaker  		services, chore services, home management services, have delivered meals, day  		care services, housing services and transportation.</p>
<h4>VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA)</h4>
<p>The Veterans Administration provides a full range of health benefits to  		certain veterans. Eligibility for services is broad, encompassing:</p>
<ul><li>veterans with injuries incurred in the line of duty;</li>
<li>veterans discharged or retired for a disability incurred in the line  		  of duty or those receiving compensation and requiring treatment for a  		  non-service-connected condition;</li>
<li>veterans who were not discharged or retired because of a  		  service-connected condition but who are (a) unable to pay, or (b) over 65.</li>
</ul><p>Wives and children of veterans with permanent, total service-connected  		disabilities and widows or children of veterans who have died as a result of a  		service-connected disability are also eligible for services.</p>
<p>Services are provided to veterans directly through the VA or through  		contract in hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric and domiciliary facilities.  		Specific services provided include inpatient care, skilled and intermediate  		nursing care, psychiatric services, domiciliary care, social services and  		rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The Veterans Administration also provides monthly benefits to housebound  		and bedbound veterans for the purchase of "aid and attendance" service. Small  		monthly payments are also made to veterans with mobility limitations who are  		housebound.</p>
<h4>VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION (VR) (Department of Education)</h4>
<p>The Vocational Rehabilitation Program, established under the  		Rehabilitation Act of 1973, provides rehabilitation services to physically and  		mentally disabled persons in order to prepare them for work. Eligibility for  		services is extended to all those with physical or mental impairments who have  		reasonable expectation of obtaining employment as a result of vocational  		rehabilitation. Within this broad definition, states set their own standards  		for services eligibility. Fur the most part services are provided to  		non-elderly adults. Additional Federal' funds are available to rehabilitate  		beneficiaries of DI and SSI.</p>
<p>Services provided are comprehensive including evaluation, counseling,  		placement, training, physical and mental restoration services and  		transportation. Funding may also be provided for hospitalization, convalescent  		or nursing home care, prosthetic, orthotic or other assistance devices,  		education, attendance services, interpreter services for the deaf, and  		specially outfitted vehicles.</p>
<h2><a name="wp5" id="wp5">WORKING PAPER #5: DYNAMICS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM</a></h2>
<h3>A. Introduction</h3>
<p>Other Working Papers in this series deal with separate elements of the  		long-term care "system". In order to understand reasonably well the potential  		impact of programmatic changes one would ideally like to understand the  		dynamics of the system -- how the elements interact. Current understanding is  		very limited.</p>
<p>In order to begin focusing on the complexities of system dynamics,  		however, the Task Force examined two related topics: (1) the supply of selected  		services and settings and (2) the "cost effectiveness" of selected  		"alternatives."</p>
<h3>B. The Supply of Long-Term Care Services and  		Settings</h3>
<h4>Need, Demand and  		Utilization</h4>
<p>The relationship between need and actual resource use is not  		straightforward. There are many determinants of utilization other than  		functional disability, such as individual choice, the availability of services,  		and costs. The translation of functional disabilities into service needs is  		attenuated by personal circumstance and is highly subjective. The following  		definitions serve to clarify the distinction between need and utilization, and  		the important concept of demand:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Need</b>: As generally defined by professional judgement other  			 than that of the recipient, need is "that quantity of services which expert  			 medical opinion believes ought to be consumed over a relevant time period in  			 order for individuals to remain or become as 'healthy' as is permitted by  			 medical knowledge." "Expert medical opinion" need not be rendered by a  			 physician; further, need may not be limited to medical needs, but may encompass  			 psychological and social needs as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Utilization</b>: "What is actually purchased or consumed" -- Many  			 persons purchase services who are judged to not need them, and many persons do  			 not purchase services who might need them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Demand</b>: The number of persons who wish to purchase a service  			 at a given price.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Clearly, needs are but one factor affecting demand. Depending on prices,  		preferences and incomes, two persons with identical "needs" may demand entirely  		different services. Thus, the need of individuals for services "is only  		suggestive of the potential demand."<sup><font><a href="#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the supply of long-term care services and settings,  		analysis indicates two principal conclusions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Current evidence is inadequate to conclude that there is currently a  			 surplus or shortage of nursing home beds and other LTC services and settings;  			 that is, whether needs are greater or less than current utilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence, however, does appear to indicate that the choices of  			 living arrangements available to the elderly have narrowed in the past 50  			 years.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The discussion which follows presents the evidence upon which these  		conclusions are based.</p>
<h4>Is There a Surplus or Shortage of Nursing  		Home Beds?</h4>
<p>Analysts who look at nursing home utilization argue that there is a  		surplus of nursing home beds. The major argument for this is the presence of  		some degree of misplacement and inappropriate use: people are in nursing homes  		who don't need to be there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, analysts who look at demand for nursing have beds  		conclude that there is a shortage. Many people who want to enter a nursing home  		bed at existing prices can't get in. Moreover, the problem of finding a bed for  		particular subpopulations such as Medicaid clients is often severe, creating a  		particular problem for the Department even if analysis concludes there is not a  		general shortage of beds.</p>
<p>These arguments are not necessarily inconsistent since many factors can  		generate excessive demand, for example: 1) the lack of appropriate  		alternatives, 2) public subsidization of nursing home care, lowering its price  		to the Medicaid or Medicare consumer, 3) absence of or insufficient public  		support for alternatives to nursing homes.</p>
<p>The Task Force, however, found the evidence inadequate to choose among  		these competing theories.</p>
<p>The surplus theory is not proven because:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The measurement of inappropriate placement is still in the early  			 stages of development and assessment methodologies are neither agreed upon nor  			 entirely free from subjective judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many determinants of nursing home use other than  			 functional disability, such as the lack of family and friends to care for even  			 a mildly impaired person at home. Therefore, there may be no other place to put  			 an "inappropriately" placed individual if "appropriateness" is determined  			 according to medical criteria. Detailed evidence on the family situation of  			 individuals with different levels of impairment is not currently  			 available.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The shortage theory is not proven because:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It is not clear why people demand care and whether their preferences  			 would shift if alternatives to nursing home beds were available. Available  			 studies of demand rely on data no more recent than 1973.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of hospital backlogs used to suport the shortage theory is  			 problematic. Backlog appears to be a local, not a national, issue. Moreover,  			 backlog may be more related to adequacy of financing than to supply. A recent  			 Department study concludes that an increase in nursing home beds would not  			 reduce backlog since providers still would perceive reimbursement for the heavy  			 care patients "backed up" as inadequate.<sup><font><a href="#note52">52</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>In general, no conclusions can be drawn because the basic data are  		weak:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Reliable data on the national nursing home bed supply are available  			 only up to 1976. Therefore it is impossible to measure recent trends.  			 Furthermore, there is wide variation in the ratio of beds to population across  			 the states and no accepted standard which indicates adequacy.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Until further evidence is available, therefore, the Task Force concludes  		that the issue whether there is a nursing home bed supply shortage or surplus  		is a state-specific and probably a local issue. Evaluating local perceptions  		indicates that generalizing about the total supply of beds on a national scale  		simply is not appropriate: there are shortages in some states, surpluses in  		others. National perspective on this issue is not very useful for policy  		purposes.</p>
<h4>The Adequacy of Supply of Non-institutional  		Long-Term Care Services</h4>
<p>Far less is known about the adequacy of non-institutional services,  		owing primarily to the fact that these services have traditionally been  		provided by family, friends, community and private sector providers at  		relatively little public expense and with little public oversight.</p>
<p>All caveats concerning studies of need and unmet need for institutional  		services also apply to such studies for non-institutional services: assessment  		instruments are imperfect; their application involves great subjectivity; needs  		are determined by many factors in addition to functional disabilities.  		Therefore, these studies are to be interpreted and used only with great  		caution.</p>
<p>The "family setting" is have for nearly 90% of all people unable to  		perform major activity.<sup><font><a href="#note53">53</a></font></sup> Not only is it home, but family members act  		as the primary help sources, regardless of the disability. Eighty percent of  		personal care services for the elderly and chronically disabled are provided by  		family members.</p>
<p>One of the most reliable studies to date on the unmet needs for social  		services of the non-institutionalized elderly indicates that the great majority  		of the elderly feel their needs for assistance in basic activities are being  		met.<sup><font><a href="#note54">54</a></font></sup> Among the social  		services studied were transportation, personal care, housekeeping, social  		activities, emergency assistance, food shopping, and food preparation. The  		majority of elderly persons (88%) reported no unmet needs. Seven percent of the  		elderly living with their spouse had one or more unmet needs, compared to 17%  		for those who lived alone, and 22% who lived with their children. The incidence  		of having one or more unmet needs increases with age, from 6% for the 65-69 age  		group to 28% for those 85 years and over. Transportation was the type of  		service most frequently cited as a problem . About 7% had unmet transportation  		needs and considered it a big problem, another 24% were somewhat restricted or  		had some problems with transportation, and the remaining 69% were generally  		self-sufficient and unrestricted.</p>
<h4>The Adequacy of Settings</h4>
<p>Loss of care-givers, reduction in the capacity of a care-giver, rapid  		depletion of income and other family resources, and physical and mental  		deterioration of the disabled person weaken the ability of the family to  		continue as the primary setting in which the disabled receive long-term care  		services. Such problems generally increase as the disabled person grows  		older.</p>
<p>Nursing homes, congregate homes, and shall group or domiciliary care  		homes provide the settings for the provision of supportive services when the  		family support mechanism collapses. The adequacy of nursing home services was  		discussed above. It is estimated that in 1976, the number of adults needing  		congregate housing, personal care homes and other sheltered living arrangements  		exceeded the number actually residing in such facilities by more than 1.1  		million. By 1985, it is estimated that unmet need will approach 1.3  		million.<sup><font><a href="#note55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nursing homes today are the principal type of institution providing  		shelter and long-term care to the chronically ill and functionally dependent.  		This is, however, a recent development. In the past, similarly dependent people  		were cared for in a greater variety of different types of institutions and  		congregate living arrangements. In order to understand recent trends in  		institutional supply and use, it is useful to consider their development from a  		longer historical perspective. Since the elderly comprise the largest segment  		of the long-term care population, discussion is focused on that group.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure5-I" id="figure5-I"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68481/wrkpprF5.gif" /></a></div>
<p><b>The Proportion of the Elderly in Institutions</b>:  		<a href="#figure5-I">Figure I</a> shows the proportion of the elderly  		enumerated in institutions and group quarters on the day of the Census from  		1890 to 1970. The gradual increase from 1.7% in 1890 to 5.5% in 1970 largely  		reflects changes in Census procedures and in the age structure of the  		population over age 65.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure5-II" id="figure5-II"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68481/wrkpprF6.gif" /></a></div>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure5-III" id="figure5-III"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68481/wrkpprF7.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Data on the institutionalized population are relatively comparable from  		1940 to 1970. The gradual increase over that period, seen in  		<a href="#figure5-I">Figure I</a>, is largely accounted for by changes in the  		age structure of the elderly. The older a person is, the greater the risk of  		institutionalization. Thus, as a greater proportion of those over age 65 are  		"old-old" (75 and older), the greater will be the proportion of all elderly in  		institutions. <a href="#figure5-II">Figure II</a> illustrates changes in the  		age structure of the elderly population from 1890 to 1980.</p>
<p>At each Census since 1950, there has been over a 50% increase in the  		oldest segment, compared to the previous decades' population. As can be seen  		from <a href="#figure5-II">Figure II</a>, the "old-old" remained a relatively  		constant proportion of the elderly population until 1940. Since that time, the  		"old-old" have comprised an increasingly larger segment. The phenomenon is  		further illustrated in <a href="#figure5-III">Figure III</a>, which shows the  		dramatic rate of growth of the oldest segment -- those over age 85. The rate of  		growth of this segment peaked in 1960; however, this growth rate has continued  		to surpass that of other age segments.</p>
<p><a href="#table5-I">Table I</a> illustrates directly the relationship  		between the age structure of the elderly population and rates of  		institutionalization. As can be seen, from 1950 to 1970, the proportion of the  		population aged 65-79 in institutions and group quarters has remained virtually  		constant. In contrast, the proportion of the population aged 80 and older  		experienced over 50% increases in their rates of institutionalization over the  		two decades. This may reflect a shift of the oldest patients out of general  		hospitals or family settings into nursing homes.</p>

By 1940, the aged mental  		hospital population had increased to one-quarter of the institutionalized aged;  		by 1970 it had declined to 12% -- approximately the same as in 1890. The  		decline of the proportion in group quarters (boarding houses, retirement  		hotels, and the like) has been equally dramatic: from 41% in 1940, to 12% in  		1970. The proportion in prisons and jails has gradually declined from 2.2% in  		1890 to 1.2 percent in 1970. Public almshouses -- by that name at least -- have  		disappeared. By contrast, the proportion in homes for the aged rose from 23.9%  		in 1890 to 72.4%, in 1970 with the greatest increase beginning in 1950.</p>
<p><b>The Impact of Public Programs on the Distribution of Settings</b>:  		Institutional types follow the public money. Efforts of reformers to close the  		almshouses and later to reduce the population of mental institutions led to  		federal programs which provided financial incentives for states and communities  		to accomplish those goals. The system responded predictably.</p>
<p>Recent federal programs also appear to have influenced the development  		of particular types of nursing homes and other "near" institutions. Between  		1960 and 1970, the number of elderly nursing home residents more than doubled.  		However, the greatest rate of growth during that period was in facilities which  		the Census described as those "not known to have nursing care." As can be seen  		in <a href="#table5-III">Table III</a>, while the elderly population in  		facilities "known to have nursing care" increased by 49%, that in other  		facilities increased by 150%.</p>
<p>Federal programs passed in the 1960s encouraged the development of  		facilities called "nursing homes", but did not in the early years have  		stringent definitions of what constituted a "nursing home." This appears to  		have encouraged the pattern observed in <a href="#table5-III">Table  		III</a>.</p>

But  		monies were expressly prohibited for payments to or care on behalf of any  		individual who is an inmate of a public institution, except as a patient in a  		medical institution".<sup><font><a href="#note56">56</a></font></sup>  		Note the change from the original Social Security Act, which prohibited  		payments to persons in any public institution. Moreover, under MAA, states were  		allowed to support the aged in public mental institutions, but only "if the  		State plan ... shows that the state is making satisfactory progress toward  		developing and implementing a comprehensive mental health program, including  		provision for utilization of community health centers, nursing homes, and other  		alternatives to care in public institutions for mental disease".<sup><font><a href="#note57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Although few states took full advantage of Kerr-Mills, and hence its  		effect may have been relatively marginal, certain provisions of MAA were  		incorporated into Medicare and Medicaid which replaced MAA in 1966. Among the  		more important for this discussion were the original prohibitions against  		payments to persons in non-medical public institutions and to persons in public  		mental or turberculosis hospitals.</p>
<p>These aspects of federal policy appear to be reflected in  		<a href="#table5-III">Table III</a>. As can be seen, there was a 105% increase  		in the elderly nursing home population, swelled with elderly people both  		discharged and diverted from state institutions. Further, while the fastest  		growing segment was in non-medical private nursing homes, public facilities  		with nursing grew faster than public facilities without nursing. The rapid  		proliferation of private "nursing homes" not known to provide nursing may be a  		result of the lack of federal definition of a nursing facility.</p>
<p>Congress used the phrase "extended care facility" (ECF). to describe  		facilities certified for Medicare participation. Standards for ECFs required  		extensive professional and supportive staffs, and such facilities never  		comprised a large segment of nursing homes. Patients in ECFs were not  		originally eligible for Medicaid. The category "skilled nursing facility" was  		devised to provide a somewhat lower level of care at lower costs for long term  		convalescent and terminal patients. However, as the cost of Medicaid rapidly  		escalated, it was asserted that many of the publicly-supported patients in SNFs  		required fewer professional services. Intermediate care facilities (ICFs) were  		designed as a less costly alternative. However, federal standards for ICFs were  		not issued until January, 1974. In the absence of uniform standards, some  		states restricted participation to professionally-staffed facilities, while  		others certified non-professionally-staffed residential facilities. Many states  		simply licensed as ICFs those facilities which failed to meet the standards for  		skilled care.<sup><font><a href="#note58">58</a></font></sup> Over  		the past decade, however, standards of participation have been considerably  		augmented.</p>
<p><a href="#table5-IV">Table IV</a> presents data from a decade of MFI  		surveys. It appears that the pattern of the 1960s has been reversed, and that  		"homes for the aged and dependent" are increasingly medically-oriented nursing  		homes. It is logical to conclude that the factor most responsible for this has  		been the large sums of public money available under Medicaid for this  		particular type of group facility.</p>

</tr></table><p>The growth of nursing homes may also be affected by another Federal  		program, the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974,  		which provides for a national network of state and local planning agencies  		which can influence the supply of institutional health services through  		regulation of capital expenditures.<sup><font><a href="#note59">59</a></font></sup> Certificate of Need (CON) laws, first  		enacted in New York in 1964, require state approval for large capital  		expenditures or significant changes in institutional health services. One of  		the penalties for disregarding CON law is loss or refusal of an operating  		license. Mile federal regulations define the basic tenets and minimum  		requirements of acceptable CON programs, each state has developed a unique  		program. The types of services to be reviewed, capital limit or other review  		trigger, criteria, review and appeals processes, and penalties vary from state  		to state. As of July 1980, all states except Louisiana have some type of CON  		legislation.</p>
<p>A related way to regulate service supply is provided by Section 1122 of  		the Social Security Act. This provision requires state approval of capital  		expenditures over a certain limit, $100,000 at present. Without 1122 approval,  		Medicare reimbursement for the institution is cut to exclude the costs of  		capital involved in the specific project.</p>
<p>While the actual review processes for 1122 and CON vary from state to  		state, in most states the HSA does the initial review and develops  		recommendations. The final decision is made at the state level. The areawide  		and state health plans are often instrumental in analyzing the need for the  		proposed project. Analysis of areawide health plans reveals that states with  		high nursing have bed-population ratios tend to have plans that call for  		reductions in the ratios, and states with low bed-population ratios call for  		increases in the ratios through increases in the supply of beds. Although  		information on CON is scarce, a small data "window" exists for the period July  		- December 1979, which casts some light on the CON activity of states which  		consider themselves overbedded or underbedded:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The nine "overbedded" states approved 240 new long-term care beds of  			 the 495 proposed between July and December 1979. Adjusted for the elderly  			 populations of these states, they added .115 bed per 1,000 persons during this  			 time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The low bed states approved an additional 2,568 beds during the last  			 six months of 1979. 3,024 beds were proposed. Adjusted for the elderly  			 populations of these states, .884 beds per 1,000 people aged 65 or over were  			 added. These numbers reflect six of the eight underbedded states; no CON/1122  			 data were available for Arizona or the District of Columbia.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is important to note that the health planning process does not take  		place in a vacuum, but within a complex health care system. There is no  		assumption that the planning agencies have caused specific changes in the  		supply of long-term care beds. Agency actions should be considered in relation  		to other parts of the health care system, the supply of acute care alternative  		types of long-term care services, reimbursement policies practices, and the  		political and economic environment. Yet, the results of this analysis  		illustrate that some health planning agencies determine whether their areas are  		overbedded or underbedded and develop formal goals to correct the imbalance.  		These goals, approved by the agency's board of consumers and providers, show  		the directions in which the community wishes to move.</p>
<p>Whether there is a shortage of congregate and other sheltered facilities  		cannot be determined with certainty. The total supply of congregate housing  		facilities is not known. HUD has identified 22,500 units which provide full  		meal service at a minimum, but there are no reliable data on supply of  		non-federally subsidized congregate housing. Also, the need for congregate  		housing cannot be estimated with any degree of precision. The potential demand  		for congregate housing is even more difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Large numbers of those currently in nursing homes could probably live  		comfortably in the community in congregate facilities. Also, many current  		residents of federally assisted housing are in need of support services in  		order to remain there safely and comfortably.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>"A survey by the International Center for Social Gerontology of 182  			 Housing Authorities with developments for the elderly built before 1970  			 revealed that 12.3 percent of the present residents needed basic services. It  			 was stated over and over that the only other alternative was eviction and  			 general reliance on the nursing home."<sup><font><a href="#note60">60</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Recent research studies, however, have estimated current need for  			 the elderly in public housing and Section 202 housing alone as perhaps 15  			 percent of the elderly individuals in residence. This could be as many as  			 100,000 persons in need of congregate services to enable them to remain in  			 their own homes."<sup><font><a href="#note61">61</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>We do not know precisely the extent of need for congregate housing and  		services among those elderly and handicapped currently residing in private,  		independent residences, but it is probably large.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Long waiting lists for entry into existing projects is evidence of  			 unmet demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that most elderly would prefer almost any other alternative  			 to a nursing home, but often do not know about congregate housing, means  			 effective demand is likely to increase as the public becomes aware and as  			 congregate facilities become a more prevalent option.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is impossible now to say with any precision what should be the  		approximate mix of congregate housing, nursing homes, and other types of  		service-enriched living arrangements. It is clear, however, that the lack of  		diversification in living arrangements for the long-term care population is a  		problem.</p>
<h3>C. The Cost of Different Long-Term Care Services and  		Settings</h3>
<p>The previous section considered issues of supply independently of issues  		of costs. Given a pattern of needs, utilization or demand, supply may or may  		not be adequate to meet it. However, public policy must also take into account  		costs, and consider whether services and settings are cost-effective while  		meeting needs or satisfying demand. Our discussion of cost will be divided into  		two parts: (1) the comparison of particular services and settings; e.g., is  		home health a cost-effective alternative to nursing homes; and (2) the impact  		on total LTC systems costs of expanding services and settings.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Whereas individuals with similar long-term care needs may experience  		similar outcomes from the same services delivered in different settings, the  		cost of the provision of those services in different settings may be entirely  		different. Further, different settings may alter the requirement for services,  		thereby altering the cost of services for similarly affected individuals. The  		growing cost of nursing have care has prompted studies of the cost and cost  		effectiveness of care delivered in alternative settings. These studies have  		became the basis for several comparative' reviews.<sup><font><a href="#note62">62</a>, <a href="#note63">63</a>, <a href="#note64">64</a>,  		<a href="#note65">65</a>, <a href="#note66">66</a>, <a href="#note67">67</a></font></sup> According to a recent critique of these  		reviews, because of the difficulty of comparing the costs of have and  		institutional care, more recent reviews of empirical studies conclude that  		little is reliably known and that more careful research is necessary.<sup><font><a href="#note68">68</a></font></sup> The studies are commonly  		faulted on several grounds: patient characteristics or outcome measures are not  		controlled; sampling methods were thought to be inadequate; samples were too  		small; cost data were not sufficiently detailed; patients were followed for too  		short a time; questions of objectivity were raised by provider involvement in  		the evaluations.</p>
<h4>Costs of Services in Different Settings</h4>
<p>Two more recent studies which avoid many of these errors are based on  		the Duke OARS assessment methodology. Nevertheless, even these studies may not  		be generalizable beyond the particular communities in which they were  		conducted. The first, a study in Durham County, North Carolina<sup><font><a href="#note69">69</a></font></sup> concludes:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In addition to the service characteristics of most nursing homes  			 (hotel services, food services, nursing services, personal care services,  			 patient activities, medical treatment, and physical and occupational therapy),  			 additional services (checking, transportation, respite care) might be needed to  			 provide comparable care in alternative settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the basic level of care, the estimates range from $13.72 to  			 $20.31 per day for alternatives compared to $19.19 in nursing homes.  			 Supplementing the basic level of care raises the costs of alternatives, and  			 increases are particularly dramatic when the basic service of the nursing home  			 (24 hour surveillance) is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nursing homes appear to be cost-effective for those who need a full  			 range and intensity of services.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The second, a study done by the General Accounting Office in  		Cleveland<sup><font><a href="#note70">70</a></font></sup>  		concludes:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The services required by the most extremely impaired elderly, about  			 10% of the population over 65, could be delivered more economically in nursing  			 homes. Only about one-third of this group are currently in institutions and the  			 remainder are able to remain outside of institutions because services are  			 provided by an informal network of family and friends. Family and friends  			 provide equivalent services of $673 per month and agencies supply an additional  			 $172 for a total of $845. These same services can be provided in a nursing home  			 for $450.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Available studies seem to indicate that for slightly impaired people,  		alternatives are more economical than nursing homes; for severely impaired  		people the opposite is true. What we do not yet know is exactly where the  		breakeven point occurs, and how to determine for which individuals and  		subpopulations which particular services and settings are cost-effective.</p>
<h4>Total System Costs</h4>
<p>Even if a particular service provided in the home is cost-effective, the  		issue of who pays becomes relevant. If government provided benefits replace  		services that are currently provided informally by family and friends, the  		total bill may increase even if services are being provided more efficiently.  		Services provided by families, although not costless, are usually less  		expensive than those purchased in a formal market. Thus the substitution (if it  		occurs) will both increase the total proportion of GNP devoted to LTC, if the  		total volume of services rendered remains constant, as well as increase the  		size of the government budget. Even if the formal service were proven to be  		much more cost-effective than an equivalent volume of services provided by  		family and friends, these potential financing shifts might make the change  		undesirable.</p>
<p>Others have argued that rather than substitute for informal care, formal  		benefits can supplement family efforts and keep even the client who would  		eventually be institutionalized in the community longer before  		institutionalization becomes inevitable. It is argued that most families  		institutionalize relatives reluctantly as a last resort and only after  		considerable personal sacrifice, and after various alternative solutions have  		been attempted. Available evidence on the extent of substitution is limited. As  		Dunlop has written:</p>
<blockquote><p> "Although common sense suggests that some families would retain their  		  dependent elderly at home longer if certain formal support services were made  		  available to them, there appears to be no hard, unbiased evidence to support  		  this notion. Carefully executed studies to date provide only mixed, partial,  		  and largely indirect findings with respect to the impact of home-based care  		  provision on rates of institutionalization for the dependent aged  		  population".<sup><font><a href="#note71">71</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of whether formally provided LTC benefits substitute for or  		further support the informal care network and under what conditions requires  		further investigation.</p>
<p>A second issue affecting total systems costs is not only whether one  		service is cheaper than another, but if cheaper, whether the less expensive  		service can effectively substitute for the more expensive service for the same  		populations.</p>
<p>A recent study by Weissert examined the costs of homemaker and adult day  		care services compared with the costs of nursing home care in a randomized  		experiment.<sup><font><a href="#note72">72</a></font></sup> Weissert  		found home services to be an addition to, not a substitute for existing  		Medicare SNF (post hospital) benefits and that costs were $3,442 per year  		higher for experimentals than controls. The social and mental functioning of  		recipients was unaffected although contentment increased. The provision of day  		care reduced the use of both SNFs and hospitals but total costs increased  		because the cost of the day care itself was much higher than the reduction in  		institutional costs. Costs were $2,692 per year higher for experimentals than  		controls. Death rates were reduced slightly but dependency, contentment, and  		mental and social functioning were only minimally affected.</p>
<p>Since the knowledge base on home based care in this country is not well  		developed, there may be much to learn from the experience of other  		countries:</p>
<blockquote><p> "At first glance at least, the experience of European countries in  		  reducing use of nursing homes through the ready availability of home based  		  services does not appear encouraging. Sweden, for example, which employs more  		  home aides per 1,000 elderly population than any other country - and where in  		  Stockholm, have aides may be utilized by one-third of the elderly population -  		  has an overall institutionalization rate at least as high as in this country.  		  Moreover, there appears to be a serious shortage of nursing home beds, with  		  perhaps as many as 30 percent of hospital beds occupied by long-term patients.  		  Thus, as one observer of the Swedish scene has suggested, whether availability  		  of home-based supportive services in that country reduces institutionalization  		  remains an unanswered question. It should be noted, however, that informal  		  supports may be especially lacking in Sweden. At least one study indicates that  		  the elderly in Sweden have the least contact with children of any western  		  society."<sup><font><a href="#note73">73</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common problem with studies looking at the cost effectiveness of  		particular LTC services and settings or the impact of additional services on  		total systems costs is that they do not allow the time necessary for the  		structural changes in the delivery system to be commonly accepted so that a new  		"normal" routine of care can be properly evaluated. The analysis of systems  		dynamics, the interaction of the supply of one service on the supply of other  		services, and the interaction of different financing options on the  		availability of each is therefore critical in formulating future policy in this  		area.</p>
<h3>D. Conclusion</h3>
<p>The long-term care system is extraordinarily complex, encompassing  		issues in the areas of health, housing, transportation, social services, income  		security and employment. The long-term care population is extremely diverse in  		its functional disabilities, illness, needs, desires, personal resources and  		living arrangements. It is not surprising that our understanding of the system  		is rudimentary: our data are poor, our methods crude, our analytical  		instruments inadequate.</p>
<p>Owing to the complexity of the task, analysis has focused on small  		segments of the system rather than taken the broad view. Although important to  		our understanding of individual components, such analysis misses the critical  		implications of the interactions among all facets of long-term care. We are  		presently ill-equipped to capture simultaneous changes and dynamics of the  		long-term care system as a whole. As a consequence, in addition to ongoing work  		on individual segments of the system, there is need for work to begin on  		modeling the long-term care system, across all segments, and over time. Such  		efforts should yield, at the very least, perspectives on the more important  		problem areas, and identification of the critical leverage points in the  		system.</p>
<h3><a name="append5-A" id="append5-A">APPENDIX  		5-A. LONG-TERM CARE, HEALTH PLANNING, AND CERTIFICATE OF NEED</a></h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>A national network of health planning agencies analyzes, plans, and  		regulates long-term care and other health services. The network consists of  		State agencies and areawide Health Systems Agencies (HSAs), mandated by  		National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, P.L. 93-641.  		This paper considers the role of health planning in long-term care. It examines  		the planning and regulatory options open to the agencies and ways in which they  		have been used to affect long-term care. Recent changes in long-term care on a  		national as well as a State level are related to health planning  		activities.</p>
<h4>Background: The Health Planning Network</h4>
<p>P.L. 93-641 created a national network for the planning and regulation  		of the health care system.<sup><font><a href="#note74">74</a></font></sup> The Act mandated Health Systems Agencies  		(HSAs) to do local or areawide planning and two State agencies to do statewide  		planning. The first, the State Health Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA)  		is a part of State government; the second, the Statewide Health Coordinating  		Council (SHCC) is an advisory committee made of representatives of the States'  		HSAs and State government.</p>
<p>The Act and its later amendments specify five purposes for the planning  		network:</p>
<ul><li>To improve health status;</li>
<li>To improve the accessibility, quality, continuity, and acceptability  		  of the health care system;</li>
<li>To restrain increases in health care costs;</li>
<li>To prevent unnecessary duplication of services; and</li>
<li>To further competition in the health care system.<sup><font><a href="#note75">75</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>The agencies are provided with certain tools to achieve these purposes.  		Their responsibilities can be grouped in three categories: planning, advocacy,  		and regulation. Their planning responsibilities require agencies to identify  		major problems of health status and the health system, goals and objectives to  		correct these problems, and strategies to implement the goals. The areawide  		agencies develop Health Systems Plans (HSPs) and Annual Implementation Plans  		(AIPs), while the SHPIIA combines the major points of these plans, adds State  		health priorities and policy considerations, and produces a State Health Plan,  		reviewed by the SHCC and the Governor. These plans define the effective and  		efficient health systems they hope to achieve. The agencies use their  		regulatory and advocacy roles to implement the plans.</p>
<p>Planning agencies can influence the supply of institutional health  		services through regulation of capital expenditures. Certificate of Need (CON)  		laws, first enacted in New York in 1964, require State approval for large  		capital expenditures or significant changes in institutional health services.  		One of the penalties for disregarding CON law is loss of or refusal of  		operating license. While federal regulations define the basic tenets and  		minimum requirements of acceptable CON programs, each State has developed a  		unique program. The types of services to be addressed, capital limit or other  		review threshold, specific review criteria, appeals procedures, and penalties  		vary from State to State. As of July 1980 all States except Louisiana have some  		type of CON legislation.<sup><font><a href="#note76">76</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A related way to regulate service supply is provided by S. 1122 of the  		Social Security Act. This provision requires State approval of capital  		expenditures over a certain limit, $100,000 at present. Without 1122 approval,  		Medicare reimbursement for the institution is cut to exclude the costs of  		capital involved in the specific project.</p>
<p>While the actual review processes for 1122 and CON vary from State to  		State, in most States the HSA does the initial review and develops  		recommendations. The final decision is made at the State level. The areawide  		and State health plans are often instrumental in analyzing the need for the  		proposed project.</p>
<p>Appropriateness review is a third regulatory tool. It involves analysis  		of existing health care services, as opposed to CON which deals with proposed  		changes only. A potentially powerful mechanism, appropriateness review is now  		being implemented.</p>
<p>The advocacy role of the planning agencies is more amorphous than their  		regulatory responsibilities. It stems from the HSA status as a community  		organization, comprised of health care consumers and providers who are  		representative of the area's population and organizations. Government,  		business, labor, and insurers participate as do representatives of different  		population groups. The HSA and the SHCC provide a forum to discuss and design  		health care policy. once goals and objectives are determined, the HSA and State  		agencies can advocate their adoption. Agencies can try to coordinate different  		organizations and interests and act as a catalyst in the community's health  		care system.</p>
<h4>Health Planning Activities  		Related to Long-Term Care</h4>
<p>Their legislative mandate requires HSAs and SHPDAs to plan for and  		regulate long-term care services as well as other facets of the health care  		system. No comprehensive analysis of what health planning has accomplished in  		long-term care exists. A review of selected plans from approximately 100 HSA's  		shows that long-term care is a primary concern of these agencies. National and  		State level data on CON and 1122 programs provide further evidence of this.</p>
<h3>A. Planning and Advocacy</h3>
<p>The Health Systems Plans examined cover an extremely wide range of  		long-term care services and non-institutional services for the  		elderly.<sup><font><a href="#note77">77</a></font></sup> Skilled  		Nursing Facility (SNF) and Intermediate Care Facility (ICF) bed supply and  		location were addressed by agencies all over the United States. Accessibility  		for Medicare and Medicaid patients was also widely mentioned. The plans show  		that there is no concensus that the United States is either overbedded or  		underbedded. Some plans call for increases in SNF and/or ICF beds while others  		call for decreases.</p>
<p>Another widespread topic was home health care, often considered an  		alternative to nursing home services. The majority of plans urged increased  		availability of home health services including, in some cases, more flexible  		reimbursement for these services. Exceptions were Florida agencies which  		stressed the need to control the number of home health care agencies as these  		agencies have proliferated in the past few years. Many plans discuss the need  		for other alternatives to nursing homes, including meals-on-wheels, case  		management programs for the elderly, and congregate living arrangements. The  		HSAs and SHPDAs that address these types of programs clearly have a  		comprehensive concept of the health care needs of their populations.</p>
<p>Some agencies have written and published consumer guides to nursing home  		and other institutional and non-institutional long-term care services in their  		areas. Two prominent examples are "I think I Need a Nursing Home. What Do I Do  		Now?" by the Metropolitan Council of Saint Paul, Minnesota and "Making Choices:  		Guidebook to Long-Term Care Facilities and Home Health Services" by the  		Illinois Central Health System Agency. The second report describes the  		services, staffing arrangements, and charges of the individual facilities in  		its area.</p>
<h3>B. Regulation</h3>
<p>The most direct way in which HSAs and SHPDAs influence long-term care  		bed supply is through COIN and 1122 decisions. These provisions allow the  		agencies some leverage in affecting the number and location of long-term care  		facilities and beds and related services. National data on the results of CON  		and 1122 reviews are incomplete; State level data are even more fragmented. On  		a national basis, an American Health Planning Association survey discovered  		that approximately 75 percent of proposed nursing home capital expenditures, or  		$1.7 billion from July 1976 through December 1978, was approved by planning  		agencies.<sup><font><a href="#note78">78</a></font></sup> Preliminary  		results of a DHHS survey reported that of 13,138 beds proposed to be added in  		the last six months of 1979, 86 percent, 11,290 beds, were approved.<sup><font><a href="#note79">79</a></font></sup> In some States bed removals are  		also reviewed. The same survey shows that 809 beds were approved for removal.  		This represents 113 percent of the 713 beds requested to be removed. It is  		important to note that both surveys are incomplete. All health planning  		agencies are not represented in the AHPA data. The DHHS data include  		preliminary data from 48 States.</p>
<h4>The Impact of Planning on Nursing Home  		Supply</h4>
<p>Aggregate information on plans and CON or 1122 decisions is difficult to  		interpret. Alone, these data don' t show whether CON and the planning program  		have a real impact on the supply of long-term care beds and other related  		services. They raise additional questions. If the bed supply is affected, are  		the changes beneficial? Are beds being added or dropped in the right places?  		The answers to these questions are critical in evaluating the role of CC and  		planning in long-term care.</p>
<p>While planning itself is not explicitly mentioned, the literature  		suggests two alternative theories of the impact of CON. In their analysis of  		CON and long-term care, Feder and Scanlon assure that CON has constrained  		supply.<sup><font><a href="#note80">80</a></font></sup> They believe  		CON may impede the accessibility of the old and the poor to nursing home beds.  		Feder and Scanlon write that alternative long-term care services that might  		substitute for a bed shortage have not been sufficiently developed or financed.  		Vladeck, on the ocher hand seems to assure that CON has not really restrained  		bed supply.<sup><font><a href="#note81">81</a></font></sup> He argues  		that CON should be used stringently to do so, while congregate housing and  		other services for the elderly are increased.<sup><font><a href="#note82">82</a></font></sup> Because a systematic analysis of the impact  		of planning agencies on long-term care has not been done, there is not yet  		reliable nationwide evidence to support either view.</p>
<h4>Need for State Level Analysis</h4>
<p>Significant variations in the ratios of long-term care beds to the aged  		population from area to area make analysis on a national basis difficult and  		potentially misleading. In 1976, the ratio of long-term care beds to population  		aged 65 and over ranged from less than 25/1,000 in Arizona and Florida to  		118/1,000 in Nebraska.<sup><font><a href="#note83">83</a></font></sup> One ,would not expect similar long-term care  		planning or regulatory decisions from two States with widely different  		ratios.</p>
<p>A State level analysis of planning, CON and bed supply provides many  		benefits. It can consider variations in State Health Plans, CON statutes, and  		the supply of long-term care beds. It can determine whether beds have been  		approved and added in places with relatively low bed supplies or in places with  		high supplies. Yet, such an analysis cannot determine causal relationships; we  		cannot say that health planning and/or CON caused a particular situation.  		Further, State analysis, except with the types of detailed case studies  		performed by Feder and Scanlon, cannot determine whether existing nursing homes  		are being allocated to the people who need this level of care. Detailed  		information on the accessibility of the beds to the Medicaid population will  		not result from a caparison of State plans, CON decisions, and bed supply.  		While this type of analysis will not provide answers to all of our questions,  		it does uncover certain directions of change.</p>
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>The lack of up-to-date information on nursing home beds, discussed in  		detail in <a href="#wp5">Working Paper #5</a>, coupled with the scarcity of  		information on CON and 1122 decisions, influenced the scope of the analysis.  		The most recent reliable data on State supply of long-term care beds is the  		1976 Master Facility Inventory, compiled by the National Center for Health  		Statistics. Some information on health plans was available from a computerized  		topic index developed by the Bureau of Health Planning, Health Resources  		Administration. Approximately 100 plans, almost all Health Systems Plans  		produced by HSAs in 1978, were abstracted and contained in the index. The  		indexed plans covered areas in almost all States, except for the District of  		Columbia, Rhode Island, Utah, New Mexico, and New Hampshire. The index includes  		one or more areas of the other States; no attempt was made to index plans from  		all sections of any single State. To comply with Departmental guidelines, all  		of these plans were supposed to address long-term care concerns. Limited  		information on CON decisions has also been gathered. Data on the CON and 1122  		decisions by State for the six months period of July through December 1979 has  		been developed by the Health Resources Administration and used in this  		analysis.</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>States were divided into three categories according to their 1976  		long-term care bed-to-population ratios. The first category was composed of  		States with relatively few beds, less than 42 beds to 1,000 elderly. This  		represents a standard deviation below the national mean of 63.9/1,000. Seven  		States and the District of Columbia were in this category. The second category  		contained all States with moderate bed ratios of from 42/1,000 to 86/1,000.  		This category includes the mean and one standard deviation above and below it.  		States with high bed-to-elderly population ratios were in the third category.  		These nine States had ratios in excess of 86/1,000. The category each State was  		assigned to is shown on <a href="#tableA5-I">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>The analysis centered on those States with very high and very low  		ratios. Indexed plans from Health Systems Agencies in these States were  		examined to note differences in their long-term care goals. The State CON and  		1122 decisions for the 1979 six month period were also studied and compared to  		the plan goals.</p>

</tr></table><h4>Results</h4>
<p>The analysis, summarized in <a href="#tableA5-II">Table 2</a>, revealed  		that States with high bed-population ratios seem to set different types of  		long-term care goals and approve different levels of beds than States with low  		ratios. Different levels of beds are applied for in States with varying bed  		supplies. 1979 CON and 1122 decisions seem to be consistent with the goals  		defined in 1978 plans. Specifically:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>States with high ratios tended to have plans that called for actual  			 reductions in the long-term care beds to elderly population ratio. These State  			 recognize themselves as overbedded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These nine "overbedded" States approved 240 new long-term care beds  			 of the 495 proposed between July and December 1979. Adjusted for elderly  			 populations of these States, they added .115 bed per 1,000 elderly persons  			 during this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plans from underbedded States called specifically for increases in  			 their supplies of long-term care beds. Data were not complete; plans from the  			 District of Columbia and New Mexico were not available from the index system.  			 Of the six States with indexed plans, five recommended increased  			 supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These low bed States approved an additional 2,568 beds during the  			 last six months of 1979. 3024 beds were proposed. Adjusted for elderly  			 populations of these States, .884 beds per 1,000 people aged 65 or over were  			 added. These numbers reflect six of the eight underbedded States; no CON/1122  			 data were available for Arizona or District of Columbia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The numbers of beds proposed in the high and low bed States also  			 differed dramatically. The level of proposed expansions were considerably  			 higher in the underbedded States.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It is important to note that the health planning process does not take  		place in a vacuum but within a complex health care system. There is no  		assumption that the planning agencies have caused specific changes in long-term  		care beds. Agency actions should be considered in relation to other parts of  		the health care system, the supply of acute care and alternative types of  		long-term care services, reimbursement policies and practices, and the  		political and economic environment. Furthermore, the distribution of beds  		within an area, may be as important as the supply of beds and cannot be  		analyzed with these data.</p>
<p>Yet, the results of this analysis illustrate that some health planning  		agencies determine whether their areas are overbedded or underbedded and  		develop formal goals to correct the imbalance. These goals, approved by the  		agency's board of consumers and providers, show the directions in which the  		community wishes to move. The goals and other parts of the health systems plans  		are published and disseminated throughout the area. Health planning statutes  		require CON and 1122 decisions to be consistent with the health systems plans.  		This analysis implies that a high degree of consistency may exist. If the  		trends shown in the 1979 CON and 1122 review information continue, high bed  		States may become less overbedded while low bed States gain beds. In these  		particular States, the bed-related goals specified in areawide plans seem to be  		coming to pass.</p>

<p><a name="note48" id="note48">Under</a> Medicaid, states have the option of  			 extending benefits to the medically needy: those whose incomes are above the  			 standards for public assistance but not high enough to cover their medical  			 expenses. Eligibility for Medicaid begins when the individual in paying for  			 medical expenses has spent down to the State's income eligibility level. The  			 states set the income standards used for eligibility determinations. Further,  			 the states can extend the spend-down provisions only to those who could be  			 considered categorically needy if state standards were as liberal as allowed  			 (option 209 b) or to a broader range of persons whose incomes place them above  			 eligibility standards for categorical assistance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note49" id="note49">In</a> some states without medically needy  			 programs, special-needs caps have been established to assist individuals whose  			 incomes are too high for Medicaid eligibility but too low to pay the full cost  			 of institutional care. Higher income standards for eligibility extended to  			 persons in nursing homes cannot exceed 300 percent of the SSI standard payment  			 amount. In these situations, Medicaid pays the difference between the  			 individuals' available income and the cost of nursing home care.</p>
