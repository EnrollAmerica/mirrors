<p>Profiles of each state’s Medicaid policies and practices with regard to assistive technology (AT) and home modifications (HM) were developed based upon the review and synthesis of Medicaid coverage policies obtained, to the extent possible, via the internet in the form of Medicaid Provider Manuals, Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Provider Manuals, state web sites, and state statutes and regulations. Profiles are included for all states and for the District of Columbia. The first page of each profile starts with an Overview of the state’s Medicaid coverage for AT and HM, and then describes the state plan coverage in detail. The profiles are arranged alphabetically, by state.</p>
<p>A state profile legend is provided below to describe each field of the state profile.</p>
