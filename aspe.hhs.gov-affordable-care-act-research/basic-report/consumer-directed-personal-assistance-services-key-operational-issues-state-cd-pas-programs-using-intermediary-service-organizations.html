<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>I. Why Has This Study Been Undertaken?</h3>
<p>This study was initiated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to identify best practices for implementing  		consumer-directed personal assistance (CD-PAS) programs through the use of  		various intermediary service organization (ISO) models. Twenty-three state and  		Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs that used ISOs in eleven states were examined  		in the study. </p>
<p>The term <i>personal assistance services</i> (PAS) refers to a range of  		human and mechanical assistance provided to persons with disabilities of any  		age who require help with routine activities of daily living (ADLs) and health  		maintenance activities. These services, when provided in non-institutional  		settings, are also frequently referred to as "home and community-based  		long-term care." PAS is the term preferred by persons with disabilities as well  		as by professionals in the disability and aging fields who advocate  		consumer-directed PAS models as a means of maximizing the independence and  		autonomy of persons who need functional assistance from others. Although PAS is  		broadly defined as including assistive technologies, home modifications,  		psychosocial rehabilitation, and a host of other specialized products and  		services oriented to persons with disabilities and chronic conditions, the core  		service is personal assistance. PAS are typically provided by an unskilled  		person who is variously referred to as a <i>personal care assistant (PCA),  		attendant</i> or <i>aide</i> (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996). </p>
<p><i>Consumer-directed</i> modes of financing and delivering PAS permit  		the consumer-as opposed to medical or social work professionals--comparatively  		greater choice and control over all aspects of service provision including: (1)  		recruiting, hiring, and training attendants, (2) defining attendants' duties  		and work schedules (3) supervising attendants regarding how specific tasks are  		to be performed, (4) managing the payroll functions, including paying  		attendants, and (5) disciplining and discharging attendants. CD-PAS programs  		may be ranked on a continuum as more or less <i>consumer-directed</i> to the  		extent that the programs foster greater choice and control with regard to  		several of the above mentioned tasks (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996).  		Consumer-direction is maximized when the consumer purchases his or her PAS with  		personal resources (unless he or she relinquishes the employer tasks to a  		provider agency). However, when a third party payor is involved in financing  		PAS (e.g., private insurance or publicly-funded programs such as Medicaid),  		certain limitations may be placed on the consumer's ability to exercise choice  		and control over his or her PAS. </p>
<p>Advocates of CD-PAS programs argue that persons with disabilities and  		chronic conditions should be afforded as much independence and autonomy as  		possible in decisions regarding the types, amounts, and sources of PAS they can  		access, especially related to PCA services. But, with choice and control come  		responsibility and risk for the consumer, as the attendant may be considered  		the consumer's employee rather than an independent contractor under the IRS and  		DoL definitions of <i>domestic servants</i> (Flanagan, 1994; Gibson, 1992;  		O.Neil and Nelsestuen, 1993; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995; Szabo, 1993). Moreover,  		persons with disabilities and chronic conditions vary greatly in their ability  		and desire to manage their PAS. </p>
<p>A number of states have implemented state and Medicaid-funded CD-PAS  		programs. The use of public funds raises significant questions related to  		program and fiscal accountability, regulatory compliance and liability for  		negligence affecting consumers or attendants which must be addressed. Because  		of these issues, states have begun to develop a variety of <i>intermediary  		service organization (ISO)</i> models to facilitate the use of CD-PAS programs  		by persons with disabilities and chronic conditions of all ages and to assist  		government policymakers in achieving an appropriate balance among the competing  		goals of: providing appropriate PAS that affords consumers' choice and control,  		while assuring program and fiscal accountability, regulatory compliance,  		protection from liability, service quality and consumer health and safety. </p>
<p>An intermediary service organization (ISO) is an entity that acts as an  		interagent between a CD-PAS program and eligible consumers for purposes of  		disbursing public funds and assisting consumers in performing tasks associated  		with the employment of PAS attendants. From the perspective of CD-PAS program,  		the core tasks of an ISO are: (1) to directly ensure compliance with legal  		requirements related to employment of PAS attendants and/or (2) to offer  		supportive services to enable consumer to perform the required employer tasks  		themselves. </p>
<p>When the ISO performs these tasks directly, it may, for example,  		calculate Social Security, Medicare (FICA), and federal and state unemployment  		tax (FUTA/SUTA) and make all appropriate tax filings with regard to the  		attendant. It may also broker and administer attendants' fringe benefits, if  		available. On the other hand, an intermediary may simply assist an eligible  		consumer by offering training in when and how to manage the employment tax and  		payroll responsibilities. In such cases, the ISO may monitor the consumer's  		performance of these tasks to ensure that the consumer is complying with all  		applicable federal and state requirements associated with employing household  		help such as a PAS attendant. </p>
<p>ISOs may provide administrative/fiscal and supportive services to  		eligible consumers. Administrative/fiscal services can include: disbursing  		public funds, withholding and filing employment taxes, brokering benefits,  		preparing and disbursing payroll checks and processing employment-related  		documents including the INS Form I-9, the IRS Form W-2, and timesheets.  		Supportive services can include: training related to hiring, firing and  		supervising attendants, managing employment taxes and payroll, assisting  		consumers in obtaining temporary or emergency "back-up" services, providing  		peer counseling, conducting and/or assisting consumers with checking attendant  		references and/or performing criminal background checks, client assessments,  		and providing case management. </p>
<p>There is no single set of services that an ISO must provide. Rather, the  		state CDPAS program agency should design ISOs that can meet the specific  		federal and state regulatory requirements and the needs of the service  		population(s). For example, one ISO may focus exclusively on performing  		administrative/fiscal tasks (e.g., payroll) on behalf of the consumer, whereas  		another ISO may focus on supportive services, such as training and assistance  		to enable consumers to perform the employer tasks themselves. </p>
<p>The ISO models examined in this study are the: Fiscal Conduit ISO, IRS  		Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, Vendor Fiscal ISO, Supportive ISO, Agency with  		Choice ISO, and the Spectrum ISO. </p>
<p>Prior to this study, little was known of the ISO models currently being  		used by states' CD-PAS programs, how well they meet the objectives of the  		various stakeholders (e.g., CD-PAS program administrators, the IRS and the U.S.  		Department of Labor, disability advocates, states' nurse licensing boards, and  		consumers and their attendants) and whether ISOs actually facilitate the use of  		CD-PAS and enhance consumers' choice and control. However, two earlier studies  		(Flanagan, 1994; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995) recommended that states use ISOs to  		manage the tax and labor law issues related to CD-PAS, and that states make  		available supportive services to consumers. </p>
<h3>II. What Is The Purpose Of This Report?</h3>
<p>This final report provides practical advice to state program  		administrators regarding the implementation of CD-PAS programs and ISOs. In  		particular, <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter III</a>, <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#contract">Chapter V</a>,  		and <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#various">Chapter VI</a>, taken together, constitute an informal  		manual of advice from which state program administrators can design optimal  		CD-PAS programs using ISOs which are based on sound, regulatory principles and  		well-drafted contracts. Overall, this final report assists state program  		administrators in designing CD-PAS programs with ISOs that:</p>
<ul><li>comply with applicable federal tax and labor laws;</li>
<li>make available supportive services that some consumers may want or  		  need; and</li>
<li>allow for the application and enforcement of any limitation or  		  restrictions on consumer direction that may be required by state laws and  		  regulations. </li>
</ul><p>It should be noted that due to the significant variation in state tax,  		labor, worker's compensation and disability insurance law, the focus of this  		study was on federal Department of Labor (DoL) and Internal Revenue Service  		(IRS) laws and their effect on CD-PAS programs and ISOs. </p>
<h3>III. How Was The Study Conducted?</h3>
<p>Twenty three CD-PAS programs in eleven states that used six different  		models of intermediary service organizations (ISOs) were selected based on a  		sampling framework that included seven categories. The seven sampling  		categories were derived from the literature, information gathered from a brief  		phone survey of state CD-PAS program administrators, and comment received from  		the study's technical advisory panel (TAP). The eleven states selected for this  		study were: Georgia, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New  		York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State. Semistructured interview  		guides were developed and used to interview the key stakeholder groups in each  		state. </p>
<p>Site visits and telephone interviews were conducted in the eleven study  		states between December 1, 1995 through August 30, 1996. One hundred  		fifty-eight interviews were conducted with one hundred eighty-nine respondents  		in the eleven states.

<p><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter Three</a> presents an overview of the important  		federal tax and labor, worker's compensation, disability insurance and  		immigration laws that are applicable to CD-PAS programs and sets forth  		alternative strategies for achieving compliance with such laws and regulations  		while preserving consumer choice and control. Each issue discussed is followed  		by best practice recommendations in cases where questions have arisen. </p>
<p>States designing these programs for consumers at all levels of desire  		and ability to manage their own affairs must find ways of ensuring that  		participants in the program comply with all applicable laws and regulations,  		state and federal. Program administrators must identify those consumers who are  		able to manage these responsibilities effectively and design program options  		consistent with these high levels of ability. At the same time, administrators  		must recognize that there may be other consumers who have neither the desire or  		the ability (in person or through a surrogate) to manage all of the fiscal and  		administrative tasks inherent in the modern employment relationship. These  		consumers may still wish to manage all other aspects of the employment  		relationship while delegating certain employment-related tasks to an  		intermediary service organization (ISO), which performs these services as the  		agent of the consumer. </p>
<p><b>A. Tax Rules Affecting CD-PAS Programs </b></p>
<p>Most of the tax issues affecting CD-PAS programs arise from federal  		income tax, social security and unemployment tax laws. Attendants appear to be  		employees of the consumer in most CD-PAS arrangements (except where an agency  		is the legal employer of record, as in the case of "Agency with Choice" ISOs).  		The level of control and supervision exercised by most consumers makes it  		difficult, if not impossible, to characterize the attendant as an independent  		contractor. </p>
<p>Whether the attendant is an independent contractor (unlikely) or an  		employee, income tax responsibility generally rests with the employee. The  		consumer-employer is not obliged to withhold income tax for a household  		employee (unless requested to do so), but the consumer must provide a statement  		of wages earned (IRS Form W-2) and must distribute notices and pay advance  		payments of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) to eligible employees. </p>
<p>With regard to employment tax issues, recent modifications to the Social  		Security Act to raise eligibility thresholds for covered workers and simplify  		filing requirements for householders have raised questions for consumers who  		receive assistance from ISOs. These ISOs (state and private vendors) have  		reported employment taxes on a quarterly basis and have been governed by  		depositing rules applicable to most other employers. Should such organizations  		alter their filing practices and procedures? <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter Three</a>  		offers best practice suggestions for resolving issues arising from the  		application of the new amendments to filing procedures previously adhered to by  		public and private ISOs acting as agents for consumer-employers in CD-PAS  		programs. Specifically, <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter Three</a> recommends that ISOs,  		acting on behalf of CD-PAS consumers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>File quarterly reports of Social Security and Medicare (FICA)  			 withholding from employee wages using federal Form 941 as advised in IRS Notice  			 95-18, adhering to the appropriate deposit rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply for a separate federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) as  			 directed by IRS Notice 95-18 for use solely in preparing tax filings as agent  			 for CD-PAS consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop strategies to deal with refunds which must be made to any  			 attendant whose earnings do not exceed $1,000 annually from an individual  			 consumer-employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, if the ISO elects to prepare an IRS Schedule H on  			 behalf of a CD-PAS consumer for his or her attendant(s) and not withhold and  			 deposit the employment taxes, the ISO should remind the consumer periodically  			 of the need to set aside monies to satisfy any employment tax liability arising  			 from the employment relationship. In cases where the ISO withholds the  			 necessary employment taxes, it must make sure to follow the appropriate IRS  			 deposit rules and manage any accrued interest accrued appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue IRS Form W-2 on behalf of the consumer to each attendant  			 receiving wages for services performed by that consumer. List only the wages  			 attributable to that consumer on the IRS Form W-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include in the total wage for each employee any co-payments made by  			 the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confer frequently with IRS regional and central office personnel on  			 any questions concerning appropriate filing methods, especially for any  			 practice which departs from the methods authorized by IRS Notice  			 95-18.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>B. Department of Labor (DoL) Rules Affecting CD-PAS Programs </b></p>
<p>Previous studies of labor laws affecting CD-PAS programs have identified  		a number of important requirements for program administrators to consider and  		incorporate in the design and rules pertaining to their state and/or  		Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs (Flanagan, 1994; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995).  		This study's analysis is based on the findings and recommendations contained in  		these studies, updated to include recent communications from tax and labor  		authorities as well as reports from the fields as to current policies and  		practices of CD-PAS programs that use ISOs. </p>
<p>Personal care attendants (PCAs) are classified as domestic servants  		under the Department of Labor's (DoL) Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  		<a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter Three</a> discusses the federal minimum wage and  		overtime rules outlined in FLSA as they pertain to domestic servants, two  		exemptions to these rules as they pertain to <i>companions</i> and  		<i>live-in</i> help, the payment of <i>night attendants</i> and OSHA related  		issues. </p>
<p>State CD-PAS program, ISO administrators, and CD-PAS consumers,  		(particularly those who manage all of the employer-related tasks for their  		attendants), must be aware of the provisions of the federal Department of  		Labor's <i>Fair Labor Standards Act</i> (FLSA) regarding domestic service  		employees (including PAS attendants), including the exemptions for  		<i>companion</i> and <i>live-in</i> staff and the provision for <i>night  		attendants</i>. Moreover, they must be aware of any additional state DoL rules  		that differ from the federal rules in order to be in full compliance with state  		and federal DoL rules related to FLSA. CD-PAS and ISO administrators should  		also assess the feasibility of using the <i>companion</i> and <i>live-in</i>  		exemptions when designing their CD-PAS programs in order to take advantage of  		any cost efficiencies related to exemptions for these worker categories. </p>
<p><b>C. State Worker's Compensation and Disability Insurance Laws and  		Their Effect on CD-PAS Programs </b></p>
<p>Worker's compensation insurance laws are state laws that establish basic  		<i>quid pro quo</i> programs. Under worker's compensation insurance laws, an  		employee agrees to relinquish his or her right to sue his or her employer for  		damages arising from injuries on the job in return for receiving prompt payment  		of benefits related to medical care and loss of income due to an injury on the  		job. Each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the  		Virgin Islands has a worker's compensation program. However, some states allow  		small employers an exemption from otherwise applicable worker's compensation  		law. For example, in Missouri, employers need not pay worker's compensation  		insurance benefits if they have fewer than four employees, whereas in New  		Jersey, an employer of even a single employee must provide worker's  		compensation insurance benefits. </p>
<p>The number of worker's compensation insurance claims reported by CD-PAS  		program and ISO administrators in this study was extremely low. For example,  		only one worker's compensation case was reported in the three states. CD-PAS  		programs reviewed that used an IRS/EA Fiscal ISO model and one from the nine  		programs reviewed that used an Agency with Choice ISO model. One reason given  		was that the majority of attendants had not experienced a work-related injury.  		Another reason given was that many PCAs did not have the knowledge or the  		financial resources to file a claim. A third reason given was that the  		consumer's income and assets were very low, making any efforts to file a claim  		against the consumer not worthwhile. However, when an Agency with Choice ISO  		was the employer of record of the PCA, even though few claims were filed, there  		was considerable apprehension about the potential cost implications of such  		claims. </p>
<p>Five states -- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island  		-- and Puerto Rico have statutes establishing state disability insurance  		programs. Under such laws, employees and, in most cases, employers must pay a  		special tax to fund the program or pay for private insurance coverage that  		meets state requirements (Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>Generally, disability insurance programs are coordinated with a state's  		worker's compensation and/or unemployment insurance programs, so in most cases,  		both taxes or premiums are paid at the same time and the particular state  		statute defines "employer" and "employee." In general, employment paying less  		than $1000 in wages in a calendar quarter is exempt from providing disability  		and/or worker's compensation insurance, although some state's have lower  		dollar-amount thresholds. For example, in New York, employers of domestic  		workers in a private home need not pay temporary disability benefits tax unless  		they have employed one or more workers for forty hours per week for at least  		four weeks, and at least thirty days in the calendar year. </p>
<p>CD-PAS program and ISO administrators and consumers, (particularly those  		who manage all of the employer-related tasks related to their attendants), must  		be aware of any state statutes for worker's compensation and disability  		insurance and the scope of these statutes in order to make sure the CD-PAS  		program and its participants are in full compliance with state law. Moreover,  		where the laws do not apply, CD-PAS program administrators may wish to consider  		the positive implications of offering such benefits, such as allowing consumers  		to effectively recruit quality attendants and to avoid any cases where even an  		inappropriate claim by an attendant may result in the state being considered  		the attendant's employer by an administrative law judge or even a court of law.  		</p>
<p><b>D. Verifying Citizen or Legal Alien Status </b></p>
<p>Employers, including employers of domestic workers (e.g., personal care  		attendants), must verify and maintain records (e.g., completed INS Form I-9)  		showing that each employee hired after November 7, 1986, is a U.S. citizen, a  		national of the U.S., or a legal alien who is authorized to work in the U.S.  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>Failure of an employer to comply with the verification and record  		keeping requirements can result in fines ranging from $100 to $1000 for each  		violation. Moreover, an employer who hires a person known to be an unauthorized  		alien can be punished by a fine of $250 to $2,000 for the first offense, with  		higher fines applicable to subsequent offenses, and criminal penalties if  		convicted of a "pattern or practice" of knowingly hiring illegal aliens  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>All of the CD-PAS programs studied were in full compliance with the  		Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the regulations regarding the  		employment verification process. State designing and implementing CD-PAS  		program, ISO administrators and consumers (particularly those that manage all  		the employer-related tasks for their attendants) should obtain and become  		familiar with a copy of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Public  		Law 99-603, 8 USC Section 1324 (1994). Moreover, whoever is responsible for the  		verification process (e.g., state IRS Employer Agent ISO, Vendor Fiscal ISO,  		Agency with Choice ISO or Spectrum ISO or consumer) should be able to perform  		all the necessary verification tasks and have a place to store the related  		documentation safely for the required amount of time. </p>
<h3>VI. The Effect of State Nurse Practice Acts on the  		Development of CD-PAS Programs</h3>
<p><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#effect">Chapter Four</a> presents an analysis of how state  		nurse licensing laws (i.e., state nurse practice acts) affect the design and  		implementation of CD-PAS programs. It also describes how state nurse licensing  		laws and CD-PAS program regulations overlap and discusses areas of actual and  		potential conflict. Two methods cited for resolving conflicts (i.e. exemption  		and delegation) are described, compared and evaluated. </p>
<p><b>A. Potential Conflicts Between State Licensing Laws and CD-PAS  		Program Regulations </b></p>
<p>State laws regulating the profession of nursing were not written with  		today's CDPAS employment relationships in mind. However, they may be construed  		to apply to tasks performed by unlicensed personnel such as personal care  		attendants (PCAs). Many CDPAS programs contain extensive lists of duties which  		may be performed by PCAs. Some of these duties, particularly those which relate  		to the maintenance of consumers. health and well being, may be seen as falling  		within the definitions of .nursing. or .nursing practice. contained in all  		state nurse practice acts. The first part of <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#effect">Chapter Four</a>  		describes areas of potential conflict between these two areas of state law </p>
<p><b>B. Exemption and Delegation: Two Ways of Reconciling State Nurse  		Practice Acts with CD-PAS Program Regulations </b></p>
<p>CD-PAS program administrators may seek to resolve actual or potential  		conflicts in at least two basic ways if unable to construe the licensing laws  		to harmonize with CD-PAS program regulations: (1) Seek a specific  		<i>exemption</i> to the application of nurse practice acts for CD-PAS programs  		within a state; or (2) work with the State Board of Nurses representatives,  		consumer advocates and other interested parties to develop workable delegation  		protocols allowing health maintenance tasks that fall within the statute's  		definition of "nursing" or "nursing practice" to be performed by unlicensed  		personnel through <i>delegation</i>. <i>Delegation</i> is the process whereby  		licensed nursing professionals delegate their authority to perform specific  		tasks to other personnel serving an individual. If the CD-PAS program is  		<i>exempt</i> from the nurse practice limits on allowable tasks, PCAs may  		perform all health maintenance and health related tasks without formal  		authorization by a licensed nursing professional. </p>
<p><b>C. Exemption and Delegation Compared </b></p>
<p>A specific <i>exemption</i> from professional nurse licensing laws  		(i.e., nurse practice acts) is easy to administer and raises the fewest  		implementation issues. However, it may not be either feasible or desirable  		(from an equitable point of view) to obtain a specific <i>exemption</i> for  		CD-PAS attendants if other unlicensed personnel are still subject to the act.  		If no exemption is available through interpretation or by legislative  		amendment, <i>delegation</i> can work for those few tasks that are clearly  		within the exclusive province of licensed nurse professionals. CD-PAS program  		administrators should work closely with all affected parties to ensure that  		<i>delegation</i> protocols affecting unlicensed personnel within a state are  		designed to facilitate CD-PAS and to meet the goals of consumer-direction and  		the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
<h3>VII. Effective Use of Contracts to Facilitate the  		Operation of CD-PAS Programs</h3>
<p>Well designed CD-PAS programs emphasize both the independence desired by  		the consumer as well as the responsibilities that go with the increase in  		independence and authority. <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#contract">Chapter Five</a> examines  		CD-PAS programs using ISOs, seeking to discover, among other things, whether,  		and how, contracts apportioning the rights and duties of the ISO, consumer and  		attendants facilitate these multi-party relationships. This study found  		considerable variation in the scope and subject matter of the contracts used in  		the twenty-three CD-PAS programs reviewed. However, it did appear that the very  		process of expressing rights, duties, responsibilities and expectations on  		paper was generally beneficial in helping the parties achieve the balance  		between consumer-direction and responsibility that worked best for all. </p>
<p><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#contract">Chapter Five</a> concluded that contracts that  		clearly spell out the duties, rights, responsibilities and expectations of the  		parties to these new and evolving relationships facilitate the efficient  		operation of CD-PAS programs that use ISOs. Although it takes time to draft a  		good contract, this time well spent can do much to anticipate and avoid future  		problems. No contract model fits all of the CD-PAS program relationships.  		However, a number of models can be developed by states to address the various  		relationships. </p>
<h3>VIII. How Well Do Various ISO Models Assist State  		Program Administrators in Designing and Implementing CD-PAS Programs and  		Consumers in Using CD-PAS?</h3>
<p><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#various">Chapter Six</a> discusses the utility of employing  		various models of intermediary service organizations (ISOs) to improve the  		delivery of CD-PAS services to persons of all ages with disabilities and  		chronic conditions. However, no ISO model is optimal for every CDPAS consumer.  		This is because, as in the general population, the characteristics of persons  		with disabilities vary from person to person. The two principal characteristics  		CD-PAS administrators must focus on when designing CD-PAS programs are the (1)  		consumer's <i>desire</i> and (2) <i>ability</i> to perform the wide range of  		employer-related tasks associated with CD-PAS. This study examined the  		effectiveness of six ISO models in balancing individual consumers. desire and  		ability to perform the CD-PAS employer-related tasks independently with the  		states. desire to provide appropriate PAS to beneficiaries while ensuring  		regulatory compliance, program accountability, quality PAS and consumer health  		and safety. </p>
<p>Each ISO model was evaluated in terms of its performance related to  		specific evaluation criteria. These were access, program and cost efficiency,  		compliance/accountability, degree of consumer-direction afforded to consumers  		and level of administrative responsibility for the consumer. </p>
<p><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#various">Chapter Six</a> describes the performance of each of  		the ISO models examined based on the study's six evaluation criteria (i.e.,  		consumer access to CD-PAS, program efficiency, cost efficiency, regulatory  		compliance and program and fiscal accountability, level of consumer-direction  		afforded to consumers and level of consumer responsibility). It also includes  		conclusions and recommendations for optimal design and implementation  		strategies for CD-PAS program administrators. The following are the conclusions  		and recommendations made for each ISO model and some that cut across ISO  		models. </p>
<p><b>A. Fiscal Conduit ISO </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>Fiscal Conduit ISOs offer consumers the highest level of  		consumer-direction and control. However, this ISO model tends to limit access  		to CD-PAS to consumers who are self-directing and who exhibit a high level of  		desire and ability to perform the employer-related responsibilities. The  		availability of effective consumer-employer skills training for consumers and  		their surrogates, when applicable, will increase consumer access to a certain  		extent. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>CD-PAS programs that use Fiscal Conduit ISOs can significantly limit the  		state's administrative efforts related to operating the program. Moreover, if a  		state negotiates the Fiscal Conduit ISO's contract and fees effectively, this  		model can be a very cost effective one for a state. </p>
<p>Regulatory compliance can vary significantly with this ISO model since  		the consumer, as the employer of record, is responsible for complying with all  		employer mandates. Program and fiscal accountability can also be variable since  		the state has the least amount of control over the administration of the CD-PAS  		program under this ISO model. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Fiscal Conduit ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>Fiscal Conduit ISOs work "best"  			 when (1) participating consumers have a high level of desire and ability, (2)  			 consumer-employer training is made available to consumers, and (3) when there  			 are strong oversight policies and procedures in place to monitor consumer  			 compliance with employer mandates and program regulations, and to assure that  			 Fiscal Conduit ISOs remain faithful to consumer-directed principles and the  			 Independent Living philosophy.</font></td>
</tr></table><p><b>B. IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>The IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO offers consumers a high level of  		consumer-direction and control and greater access to the CD-PAS program than is  		afforded by the Fiscal Conduit ISO. Even though the consumer is the legal  		employer of record of his or her attendant(s), this ISO model reduces the  		consumer's employer-related responsibilities by managing the payroll function  		(managing employment taxes, benefits where appropriate, and preparing and  		disbursing payroll checks) for the consumer. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Under the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO model, the state has a  		significant amount of control over the administration of the program. However,  		this model may not lead to significant program efficiencies since the state may  		have to establish dual financial and accounting systems in order to manage the  		fiscal agent functions effectively (e.g., one system for the CD-PAS attendants  		and one for the general state employee population). This model may not be the  		most cost efficient ISO model for states since they may have difficulties  		achieving cost efficiencies using existing state personnel and systems. </p>
<p>The IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO model affords states a high level of  		compliance with employer mandates, a high level of program and fiscal  		accountability (due to the fact that the state itself is performing the payroll  		function for consumers) and allows states to retain significant control over  		the operation of the CD-PAS program. However, attendants often erroneously  		consider the state to be their employer of record under this model. This  		confusion can result in an additional administrative burden for the CD-PAS  		program agency. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>States that wish to implement the  			 IRS Employer Agent ISO model need to examine their existing payroll and fiscal  			 accounting systems to assess their ability to accommodate the separate  			 accounting and regulatory requirements needed for CD-PAS attendants. If a  			 state's current systems can not accommodate the new and required functions, a  			 state needs to assess the financial and operational feasibility of developing  			 the additional capabilities. Finally, if the systems modifications are not  			 operationally and/or financially feasible, then the state should consider  			 implementing a Vendor Fiscal ISO model.</font></td>
</tr></table><p><b>C. Vendor Fiscal ISO </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>Like the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, the Vendor Fiscal ISO offers  		consumers a high level of consumer-direction and control and allows greater  		access to the CD-PAS program than afforded by the Fiscal Conduit ISO. Although  		the consumer is the employer of record for his or her attendant, under this ISO  		model, a private Vendor Fiscal ISO reduces the consumer's employer-related  		responsibilities by managing the payroll function (managing employment taxes,  		benefits where appropriate, and preparing and disbursing payroll checks) for  		the consumer. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Unlike the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, the Vendor Fiscal ISO can  		offer states a reasonable level of program and cost efficiencies related to the  		administration of the program, particularly if the state effectively negotiates  		the state's Vendor Fiscal Agent ISO contract and the fees to the ISO. Since the  		state is using a vendor to perform fiscal and administrative functions on  		behalf of consumers and the state, it should develop explicit performance  		standards in the vendor contract so it can effectively monitor each vendor's  		ability to fulfill their responsibilities and their commitment to  		consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
<p>As with the IRS Employer Agent ISO, the Vendor Fiscal ISO model can  		achieve a high level of compliance with IRS and DoL laws since the vendor is  		performing the payroll function for consumers. Moreover, this model can also  		achieve a high level of program and fiscal accountability if the state drafts  		and implements effective vendor performance standards in Vendor Fiscal ISOs'  		contracts. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Vendor Fiscal ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>This study concludes that the  			 Vendor Fiscal ISOs offer states many advantages in terms of administrative and  			 cost efficiencies while reflecting a high level of consumer-direction for  			 consumers. While the states that used this ISO model appeared to be  			 reluctant to permit participating consumers to use surrogates ( e.g., a person  			 the consumer designates to act on his or her behalf such as a family member,  			 friend, holder of the durable power of attorney, or guardian), there is no  			 reason why consumers with surrogates cannot participate in a CDPAS program that  			 uses this type of ISO, provided that appropriate monitoring policies and  			 procedures related to surrogates' performance are in place.</font></td>
</tr></table><p><b>D. Agency with Choice ISO </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>In this model, the ISO is the legal employer of record and the consumer  		is considered the <i>managing employer</i>. Agency with Choice ISOs can offer  		consumers varying levels of consumer-direction depending on the desires and  		abilities of the consumer and the philosophy of a particular ISO. This ISO  		model can significantly reduce the level of consumer responsibility depending  		on what employer-related tasks it performs for consumers other than the payroll  		function. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>The Agency with Choice ISO can provide a high level of program  		efficiency since it manages a significant portion of the administrative work  		associated with CD-PAS programs. This ISO model can be cost efficient if the  		state CD-PAS program agency effectively negotiates its contract and fees with  		the ISO. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Agency with Choice ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>Agencies with Choice ISOs can  			 offer states and consumers varied levels of consumer-direction depending on the  			 type of consumers participating in the CD-PAS program and the ISO's commitment  			 to consumer-direction and the Independent Living philosophy. Even if the ISO is  			 agency-based, the ISO will not necessarily have high administrative costs  			 similar to traditional home health agencies. Proper rate negotiation by the  			 state can result in this model being quite cost effective. Moreover, if the  			 proper consumer-directed philosophy is followed in agency practices, this ISO  			 model can potentially serve consumers with a broad range of ages and  			 disabilities. This study recommends that states using the Agency with  			 Choice ISO model in the design of their CD-PAS program offer consumers varying  			 levels of consumer-direction depending on the needs and desires of the consumer  			 population. Moreover, states should consider allowing consumers to use Agency  			 with Choice ISO in order to obtain relief attendant services. Finally, this  			 study recommends that state CD-PAS programs that use Agency with Choice ISOs  			 develop performance standards that effectively monitor an ISO's and its  			 subcontractors' commitment to and application of consumer-direction  			 principles.</font></td>

<p>Supportive intermediary services provided by either a stand-alone ISO or  		incorporated in one of the other ISO models, can enhance the level of access  		and consumer-direction afforded to consumers. These services can also assist  		consumers with the employer responsibilities associated with CD-PAS and in some  		cases (i.e., by maintaining an attendant registry), actually reduce such  		responsibilities for consumers. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Depending on how these services are administered, bundled and  		reimbursed, supportive services can be more or less efficient from a program  		and a cost perspective. They do enhance consumer compliance with regulatory  		mandates and can indirectly enhance CD-PAS program and fiscal accountability by  		developing more well informed consumers. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>F. Spectrum ISO </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>The Spectrum ISO model maximizes access and consumer-direction for  		consumers participating in a CD-PAS program while allowing consumers to assume  		the level of employer responsibility they feel comfortable with. Consumers may  		or may not be the employer of record of their attendant depending on the  		intermediary service option(s) selected by the consumer. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Well designed Spectrum ISOs can offer states program and cost  		efficiencies by developing a seamless CD-PAS service delivery system. This ISO  		model can also achieve a high level of regulatory compliance and program and  		fiscal accountability while allowing the consumer to select from a range of  		intermediary service options. The primary reason for this is because the  		Spectrum ISO has the ability to transfer unsuccessful consumers into an ISO  		option that reduces their employer responsibility (i.e., can move a client who  		is unable to comply with the employer responsibilities from the "cash" option  		to one where the ISO manages the payroll function for the consumer). This model  		may also be effective in assisting consumers to obtain relief attendants on  		weekends, holidays and when their attendants are absent for any reason. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Spectrum ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font> Use of the "Spectrum" ISO model  			 permits a state to offer consumers a wide range of intermediary service options  			 through a single umbrella organization. Thus, a state maintains control over  			 the CD-PAS program and ISO design and philosophy, while at the same time,  			 offers consumers a broad range of intermediary services to assist them in  			 accessing and successfully participating in CD-PAS programs. This ISO model can  			 eliminate the need for and the costs associated with multiple CD-PAS programs  			 that use a variety of ISOs and allow a state to develop a seamless CD-PAS  			 service delivery model. The Spectrum ISO also allows consumers to access the  			 intermediary services that meet their current and future needs. This  			 report recommends that states consider implementing Spectrum ISOs when  			 designing CD-PAS programs. The keys to a successful Spectrum ISO are: (1) good,  			 testable performance standards in provider contracts, (2) a strong commitment  			 from vendor ISOs' and their subcontractors to the principles of  			 consumer-direction and the Independent Living philosophy, and (3) periodic  			 monitoring and evaluation of Spectrum ISOs and their  			 subcontractors.</font></td>
</tr></table><table><tr><td><b>Conclusions and Recommendations  			 that Cut Across ISO Models</b></td>
</tr><tr><td>
<p> There are a number of conclusions and recommendation that are  				applicable to all ISO models. These include the following. </p>
<ol><li>
<p>The most successful State-ISO contract relationships are  					 forged when the state has a clear understanding of the services it wishes to  					 purchase from an ISO. </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop  					 contracts with ISOs that clearly state an ISO.s role, responsibilities and  					 services. These contracts should include performance standards that can be used  					 to assess an ISO's activities and its commitment to consumer-directed  					 principles and the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers's back-up plans for relief attendants frequently  					 fail, causing consumers to have a difficult time finding relief attendants over  					 weekends, holidays and when the primary attendant is absent for any reason.  					 </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop a  					 mechanism that facilitates consumers access to relief attendants, possibly  					 through an arrangement with a Agency with Choice ISO or a Spectrum ISO that  					 offers an agency-based PAS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers are hesitant to initiate criminal background checks  					 on prospective attendants because they do not know how to conduct them and they  					 feel these checks compromise the consumer-attendant relationship. </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop a  					 standard user friendly system implemented by a program or an ISO, that either  					 assists consumers in performing this task or directly conducts criminal  					 background checks on prospective attendants for consumers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The availability of supportive intermediary services varies by  					 ISO model. However, some level of supportive services is key for consumers to  					 successfully participate in a CD-PAS program. </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should incorporate  					 supportive intermediary services into their CD-PAS program no matter what other  					 ISO model is used. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISOs, and the agencies they subcontract with, vary in their  					 commitment to consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living  					 philosophy. </p>
<p>Therefore, states should develop performance standards in ISO  					 contracts that address the ISO's and their subcontractors' commitment to  					 consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State nurse practice acts and their effect on CD-PAS programs  					 vary from state to state. </p>
<p>Therefore, states should pursue exemptions to their nurse  					 practice acts if possible, or should seek to develop protocols permitting  					 delegation that are consistent with CD-PAS program goals and the Independent  					 Living philosophy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of states have considered personal care attendants to  					 be independent contractors and some continue to consider them as such even  					 though regulatory authorities have determined them to be <i>someone's  					 employee</i>. </p>
<p>Therefore, states should design programs with mechanisms  					 (including intermediary services) that assist consumers in complying with the  					 IRS rules for household employees and avoid referring to personal care  					 attendants as independent contractors. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of disability advocates and CD-PAS consumers  					 expressed concern about the potential impact of managed care on the  					 availability of CD-PAS to eligible consumers. </p>
<p>Therefore, state Medicaid managed care programs for the  					 elderly and persons with disabilities should be designed to include and  					 accommodate this important service option. </p>

<h3>I. Why Has This Study Been Undertaken?</h3>
<p>In 1991, the Institute of Medicine estimated that 35 million  		Americans--one of every seven--had a disability that interfered with their  		ability to conduct daily activities. Of these persons, it has been estimated  		that 3.1 million Americans, nearly one third of whom are under the age of 65,  		would qualify to receive benefits (ASPE, 1994). Historically, professional  		authority has played a dominant role in the social organization of medical care  		and related human services (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996; Friedson, 1970).  		Moreover, until recently, formal, publicly-funded home and community-based  		long-term care (HCB-LTC) services have been narrowly focused on the elderly  		population, limited by implicit assumptions about retirement lifestyles and  		conceptualized in terms of "alternatives to institutionalization." </p>
<p>Over the past twenty years, with the development of the Independent  		Living and Disability Rights movements, there has been a growing societal  		recognition of the barriers that often prevent persons with disabilities and  		chronic conditions--especially working age adults--from actively participating  		in the kinds of activities (e.g., school, work, recreation, and travel) that  		are engaged in by able-bodied persons. A fundamental premise of the IL Movement  		is that individuals with disabilities are "handicapped" primarily by barriers  		in their environments rather than by their impairments or disabilities (DeJong,  		Batavia and McKnew, 1992). Therefore, if such barriers are removed, people with  		disabilities can function normally in society (DeJong, Batavia and McKnew,  		1992). One such barrier has been, and continues to be, the lack of access to  		appropriate <i>personal assistance services (PAS)</i> (DeJong, 1981, Litvak et  		al, 1987). </p>
<p>Another key premise of the IL Movement is that "persons with  		disabilities are self-directed consumers of services capable of managing their  		lives." Persons with varying levels and types of disability--of all ages--who  		use PAS have long expressed their desire to exercise more choice and control  		over the PAS they receive (Doty, Kasper, Litvak and Taylor, 1993 and 1994).  		This premise and desire is supported by the emerging ideology of "consumerism"  		which has begun to assert itself in the health and human service domain (Doty,  		Kasper and Litvak, 1996). Thus, from the IL and Disability Rights movements and  		the emergence of consumerism in health and human services has developed the  		concept of <i>consumer-directed personal assistance services (CD-PAS)</i>  		(Litvak, Zukas, and Heumann, 1987; DeJong, Batavia and McKnew, 1992;  		Simon-Rusinowitz and Hofland; Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996). </p>
<p>The term <i>personal assistance services</i> (PAS) refers to a range of  		human and mechanical assistance provided to persons with disabilities of any  		age who require help with routine activities of daily living (ADLs) and health  		maintenance activities. These services, when provided in non-institutional  		settings, are also frequently referred to as "home and community-based  		long-term care." PAS is the term preferred by persons with disabilities as well  		as by professionals in the disability and aging fields who advocate  		consumer-directed PAS models as a means of maximizing the independence and  		autonomy of persons who need functional assistance from others. Although PAS is  		broadly defined as including assistive technologies, home modifications,  		psychosocial rehabilitation, and a host of other specialized products and  		services oriented to persons with disabilities and chronic conditions, the core  		service is personal assistance. PAS are typically provided by an unskilled  		person who is variously referred to as a <i>personal care assistant (PCA),  		attendant</i> or <i>aide</i> (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996). </p>
<p><i>Consumer-directed</i> modes of financing and delivering PAS permit  		the consumer-as opposed to medical or social work professionals--comparatively  		greater choice and control over all aspects of service provision including: (1)  		recruiting, hiring, and training attendants, (2) defining attendants' duties  		and work schedule (3) supervising attendants regarding how specific tasks are  		to be performed, (4) managing the payroll functions, including paying  		attendants, and (5) disciplining and discharging attendants. CD-PAS programs  		may be ranked on a continuum as more or less <i>consumer-directed</i> to the  		extent that the programs foster greater choice and control with regard to  		several of the above mentioned tasks (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996).  		Consumer-direction is maximized when the consumer purchases his or her PAS with  		personal resources (unless he or she relinquishes the employer tasks to a  		provider agency). However, when a third party payor is involved in financing  		PAS (e.g., private insurance or publicly-funded programs such as Medicaid),  		certain limitations may be placed on the consumer's ability to exercise choice  		and control over his or her PAS. </p>
<p>Advocates of CD-PAS programs argue that persons with disabilities and  		chronic conditions should be afforded as much independence and autonomy as  		possible in decisions regarding the types, amounts, and sources of PAS they can  		access, especially related to PCA services. But with choice and control come  		responsibility and risk for the consumer, as the attendant may be considered  		the consumer's employee rather than an independent contractor under the IRS and  		DoL definitions of <i>domestic servants</i> (Flanagan, 1994; Gibson, 1992;  		O.Neil and Nelsestuen, 1993; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995; Szabo, 1993). Moreover,  		persons with disabilities and chronic conditions vary greatly in their ability  		and desire to manage their PAS. </p>
<p>Finally, CD-PAS programs may allow a consumer to have a surrogate,  		(either a family or non-family member), manage the employer-related  		responsibilities associated with employing an attendant on the consumer's  		behalf (as in the case of a person who may have a cognitive impairment or  		mental retardation). CD-PAS programs that allow surrogate participation can  		greatly increase consumers' access to CD-PAS services. However, CD-PAS program  		administrators must be vigilant in monitoring issues of consumer health and  		safety and PAS quality for this population when surrogates are used. </p>
<p>A number of states have implemented state and Medicaid-funded CD-PAS  		programs. The use of public funds raises significant questions related to the  		use of public funds, program and fiscal accountability, regulatory compliance  		and liability for adverse outcomes for consumers which must be addressed.  		Because of these issues, states have begun to develop a variety of  		<i>intermediary service organization (ISO)</i> models to facilitate the use of  		CD-PAS programs by persons with disabilities and chronic conditions of all ages  		and to assist government policymakers in achieving an appropriate balance among  		the competing goals of: providing appropriate PAS that affords consumers choice  		and control, while assuring program and fiscal accountability, regulatory  		compliance, protection from liability, service quality, and consumer health and  		safety. </p>
<p>An intermediary service organization (ISO) is an entity that acts as an  		interagent between a CD-PAS program and eligible consumers for purposes of  		disbursing public funds and assisting consumers in performing tasks associated  		with the employment of PAS attendants. From the perspective of CD-PAS program,  		the core tasks of an ISO are: (1) to directly ensure compliance with legal  		requirements related to employment of PAS attendants and/or (2) to offer  		supportive services to perform the required employer tasks themselves. </p>
<p>When the ISO performs these tasks directly, it may, for example,  		calculate Social Security, Medicare (FICA), and federal and state unemployment  		tax (FUTA/SUTA) and make all appropriate tax filings with regard to the  		attendant. It may also broker and administer attendants' fringe benefits, if  		available. On the other hand, an intermediary may simply assist an eligible  		consumer by offering training in when and how to manage the employment tax and  		payroll responsibilities. In such cases, the ISO may monitor a consumer's  		performance of these tasks to ensure that the consumer is complying with all  		applicable federal and state requirements associated with employing household  		help such as a PAS attendant. </p>
<p>ISOs may provide administrative/fiscal and supportive services to  		eligible consumers. Administrative/fiscal services can include: disbursing  		public funds, withholding and filing employment taxes, brokering benefits,  		preparing and disbursing payroll checks and processing employment-related  		documents including the INS Form I-9, IRS Form W-2 and timesheets. Supportive  		services can include: training related to the hiring, firing and supervising  		attendants, assisting consumers in obtaining temporary or emergency .backup  		services, providing peer counseling, conducting and/or assisting consumers with  		checking attendant references and/or criminal background checks, performing  		assessments, and providing case management. </p>
<p>There is no single set of services that an ISO must provide. Rather, the  		state CD-PAS program agency should design ISOs that can meet the specific  		federal and state regulatory requirements and the needs of the service  		population(s). For example, one ISO may focus exclusively on performing  		administrative/fiscal tasks (e.g., managing employment taxes and payroll) on  		behalf of the consumer, whereas, another ISO may focus on supportive services,  		offering training and assistance to consumers so that they may perform the  		employer tasks themselves. </p>
<p>The ISO models examined in this study are the: Fiscal Conduit ISO, IRS  		Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, Vender Fiscal ISO, Supportive ISO, Agency with  		Choice ISO, and the Spectrum ISO. </p>
<p>Prior to this study, little was known of the ISO models currently being  		used by states. CD-PAS programs, how well they meet the objectives of the  		various stakeholders (e.g., CD-PAS program administrators, the IRS and the U.S.  		Department of Labor, disability advocates, states. nurse licensing boards, and  		consumers and their attendants) and whether ISOs actually facilitate the use of  		CD-PAS and enhance consumers' choice and control. However, two earlier studies  		(Flanagan, 1994; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995) recommended that states use ISOs to  		manage the tax and labor law issues related to CD-PAS, and that states make  		available supportive services to consumers. </p>
<p>The purpose of this study, initiated by the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the U.S. Department of Health  		and Human Services, was to identify best practices for implementing CD-PAS  		programs using various models of ISOs by examining twenty-three state and  		Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs in eleven states. It should be noted that due  		to the significant variation in state tax, labor and worker's compensation and  		disability insurance law, the focus of this study was on federal Internal  		Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (DoL) laws and their effect on  		CD-PAS programs and ISOs. </p>
<h3>II. What Is The Purpose of This Report?</h3>
<p>This final report provides practical advice to state program  		administrators regarding the implementation of CD-PAS programs using ISOs. In  		particular, <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter III</a>, <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#contract">Chapter V</a>  		and <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#various">Chapter VI</a> taken together, constitute an informal  		manual of advice from which state program administrators can design CD-PAS  		programs using ISOs which are based on sound regulatory principles and well  		drafted contracts. Overall, this final report assists program administrators to  		design CD-PAS programs with ISOs that:</p>
<ul><li>comply with applicable federal tax and labor laws;</li>
<li>make available supportive services that some consumers may want or  		  need; and</li>
<li>allow for the application and enforcement of any limitation or  		  restrictions on consumer direction that may be required by state laws and  		  regulations. </li>
</ul><h3>III. How Was The Study Conducted?</h3>
<p>Twenty three CD-PAS programs in eleven states that used six models of  		intermediary service organizations (ISOs) were selected based on a sampling  		framework that included seven categories (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendI">Appendix  		A</a>). The seven sampling categories were derived from the literature,  		information gathered from a brief phone survey of state CD-PAS program  		administrators, and comment received from the study's technical advisory panel  		(TAP). A list of the TAP members may be found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendII">Appendix  		II</a>. The eleven states selected for this study were: Georgia, Idaho, Maine,  		Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and  		Washington State. </p>
<p>Semi-structured interview guides were developed and used to interview  		the key stakeholder groups in each state. Copies of the interview guides may be  		found in <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendIII">Appendix  		III</a>. </p>
<p>Site visits and telephone interviews were conducted in the eleven study  		states between December 1, 1995 through August 30, 1996. One hundred  		fifty-eight interviews were conducted with one hundred eighty-nine respondents  		in the eleven states (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendIV">Appendix  		IV</a>). Key stakeholders interviewed included: state CD-PAS program  		administrators, ISO administrators, executive directors of the states' board of  		nurses, and home health agencies, disability and elderly advocates, and  		consumers and their attendants. Of the one hundred eighty-nine respondents  		interviewed, forty-one were consumers and twenty-two were attendants. </p>
<p>Meetings and briefings were held with key central office staff at the  		Internal Revenue Service and Department of Labor to discuss IRS and DoL rules  		and regulations pertinent to the study. </p>
<p>The final report for the study addresses six policy relevant  		questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What are the various models of ISOs and how do they  			 operate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the federal laws and regulations issues that affect the  			 development and operation of ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do contracts facilitate the operation of CD-PAS programs that  			 use ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the incentives and barriers that affect the development and  			 operation of CD-PAS program with ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do States' nurse practice acts affect the development and  			 operation of CD-PAS programs with or without ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well do the various ISO models facilitate the use of CD-PAS  			 programs for state program administrators and consumers with disabilities and  			 chronic conditions? </p>

</ul><h2><a name="character" id="character">CHAPTER TWO. CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSUMER-DIRECTED  		PERSONAL ASSISTANCE (CD-PAS) AND INTERMEDIARY SERVICE ORGANIZATION (ISO)  		MODELS</a></h2>
<h3>I. What Are Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance  		Services (CD-PAS)?</h3>
<p><b>A. What are Personal Assistance Services?</b></p>
<p>There is a growing literature which provides a definition and a  		description of the key features of personal assistance services (Kennedy, 1993;  		Litvak, 1990; Litvak et al, 1991; Maton et al, 1993; NCOA, 1996; Nosek, 1991;  		Seelman, 1993). <i>Personal Care Assistance Services (PAS)</i> is a broadly  		inclusive term used to refer to a range of human and mechanical assistance  		provided to persons with disabilities and chronic conditions of all ages which  		enables them to accomplish .tasks that they would normally do for themselves if  		they did not have a disability. (Litvak et al., 1990). Such tasks include, but  		are not limited to, assistance with personal care (e.g., Activities of Daily  		Living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting and transferring,  		and health maintenance activities (such as catheter care). PAS also enhances  		household maintenance (e.g., Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)  		such as transportation, shopping, housecleaning, meal preparation and laundry).  		PAS are not just limited to services provided in specific settings (e.g., the  		home, office, recreation) nor are PAS limited to human assistance. PAS can also  		include assistive technologies, environmental adaptations, including  		transportation services, animal assistance (e.g., guide dogs), and the  		appropriate training for utilizing both human and other forms of assistance.  		The <i>core</i> service is personal assistance which is typically provided by  		an unskilled person who is variously referred to as a <i>personal care  		assistant (PCA), attendant</i> or <i>aide</i> (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996).  		The term PAS reflects the philosophy of the Independent Living (IL) movement  		and has been developed as a replacement or synonym for .home and  		community-based long-term care services" to take into account the needs of  		persons with disabilities and chronic conditions to engage in activities that  		able bodied persons would normally pursue. </p>
<p><b>B. What are Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Services?</b></p>
<p><i>Consumer-directed</i> modes of financing and delivering PAS permit  		the consumer --as opposed to medical or social work  		professionals--comparatively greater choice and control over all aspects of  		service provision, including the employer-related responsibilities associated  		with employing and supervising an attendant. However, with choice and control  		come significant employer-related responsibilities, some of which are mandated  		by state and federal laws and regulations. Some consumers have the ability and  		desire to manage these tasks and eagerly embrace the employer-related  		responsibilities associated with the "pure" CD-PAS program model (e.g., cash  		benefit/voucher programs).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Others may not have the <i>ability</i> and/or  		<i>desire</i> to manage all of the employer-related tasks or may prefer to  		manage only a select few. </p>
<p>CD-PAS programs may be ranked on a continuum as more or less  		<i>consumer-directed</i> to the extent that the programs foster greater choice  		and control with regard to tasks mentioned earlier (Doty, Kasper and Litvak,  		1996). Services purchased and financed by private individuals can afford  		consumers the highest level of choice and control (except when the consumer  		voluntarily relinquishes all or most of the employer duties and role by  		choosing to contract with a traditional provider agency). Publicly-funded  		CD-PAS programs place some limits on the consumer's choice and control over his  		or her PAS, particularly those that are federally-funded (e.g., Medicaid). In  		contrast, state-funded CD-PAS programs frequently offer more flexibility and a  		higher level of choice and control to consumers (e.g., allowing consumers to  		receive cash allowances and pay their attendants directly, and allowing persons  		with varying incomes to participate in a CD-PAS program based on a sliding fee  		scale).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> However, the  		relative scarcity of state funds often limits the number of consumers who can  		participate and the amount of PAS a consumer may receive from state-funded  		CD-PAS programs. </p>
<p>CD-PAS programs that are financed as a regular optional Medicaid state  		plan benefit, and to a lesser extent, through a Section 2176 Medicaid home and  		community-based services waiver, have the potential to serve more consumers and  		provide more services/consumer because state funds are supplemented by federal  		matching funds.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note3">3</a></font></sup>  		However, Medicaid rules may limit the level of consumer choice and control a  		CD-PAS program can offer consumers (e.g., consumers may not directly receive  		Medicaid cash benefits or pay their attendants directly with Medicaid funds at  		this time). Moreover, under Medicaid waivers, the type and number of consumers  		participating may be limited due to program eligibility requirements (e.g.,  		consumers must be at risk of institutionalization; the cost of consumer's  		community-based services may not exceed the cost of institutional care in the  		aggregate; the use of relatives as paid attendants is restricted; and sliding  		fee scale arrangements are not always available). </p>
<p>Private entities such as insurance companies, concerned about liability  		to the company and the quality of PAS provided to the beneficiary, tend to  		afford their beneficiaries the lowest level of consumer choice and control.  		Consumers with private insurance are often required to purchase their PAS from  		traditional provider agencies that may not be able to accommodate the unique  		requirements of consumers. service needs. However, some private insurance  		companies have begun to consider offering a PAS benefit that uses a cash  		benefit and offers consumers a higher level of choice and control. </p>
<p>Both publicly and privately-funded CD-PAS programs may allow a consumer  		to be the employer of record for his or her attendant. Some may allow a  		consumer to have a family or non-family member act as a surrogate on his or her  		behalf for the purpose of hiring and managing his or her attendant(s). The use  		of surrogates is of great importance to persons with cognitive impairments and  		mental retardation who wish to exercise a level of choice and control over  		their PAS through a surrogate. The use of surrogates and the issues raised by  		surrogates continue to be examined by state program administrators and federal  		and state policymakers. </p>
<p><b>C. Why do Public Program Administrators Consider Developing CD-PAS  		Programs and What are Their Concerns?</b></p>
<p>Public program administrators considering designing and implementing  		CD-PAS programs do so for a number of reasons. First, they want to develop  		health and human service programs that appropriately meet the needs of their  		diverse service population(s). Second, states see CD-PAS programs as a way to  		reduce the administrative overhead costs related to the provision of  		traditional agency-based PAS. Finally, in some cases, states view CD-PAS  		programs as a mechanism to achieve overall budget savings and efficiencies by  		"downsizing" government through privatization of government functions. </p>
<p>At the same time, CD-PAS program administrators also have a number of  		concerns regarding the implementation of CD-PAS programs. First, they want to  		establish clearly that the CD-PAS program agency <i>is not</i> the employer of  		record of the PAS attendant. For the most part, states and private entities do  		not want to be the employer of record for attendants nor do they wish to be  		perceived as such, since this would increase their actual or potential  		responsibility for payroll, benefits and related administrative costs (e.g.,  		union wages and benefits, worker's compensation, and pensions). Second, even  		where the state is specifically not legally the employer, states want to make  		sure that the CD-PAS program is in compliance with legally mandated state and  		federal employer-related requirements (e.g., FICA and FUTA/SUTA, federal and  		state DoL minimum wage and overtime rules and OSHA, and state worker's  		compensation laws). Third, states want to be assured of a basic level of  		program and financial accountability (e.g., so that potential program fraud and  		abuse are minimized). Fourth, states and private entities are concerned about  		the impact any federal or state-specific requirements might have on the level  		of choice and control that can be afforded consumers (e.g., provisions of state  		Nurse Practice Acts that limit the duties that an attendant may perform; state  		attendant certification and/or training requirements; and federal Medicaid  		requirements that preclude paying some relatives as attendants, distributing a  		cash benefit to consumers and allowing consumers to pay their attendants  		directly with Medicaid funds). Finally, states are concerned with the correct  		apportionment of liability for adverse outcomes to consumers and attendants and  		the overall quality of services provided in a CD-PAS program (e.g., consumer  		and attendant health and safety issues). The first four issues are addressed  		with greater specificity in subsequent chapters of this report. </p>
<p>It should be noted that this study principally examined federal  		employment-related responsibilities related to developing and implementing  		CD-PAS programs. Often, there are state-specific requirements that may have a  		bearing on how a CD-PAS program is designed and administered (e.g., states'  		worker's compensation laws, provisions for minimum wage and overtime pay, and  		nurse practice acts). When developing and implementing a CD-PAS program,  		program administrators should make sure that the program design addresses  		<i>both</i> federal and state requirements before the program is implemented in  		order to avoid any problems with federal or state laws and regulations after  		the program is implemented. </p>
<p><b>D. Are Attendants Independent Contractors?</b></p>
<p>Initially, many state-funded and a number of Medicaid-funded CD-PAS  		programs sought to simplify the employer-related duties for consumers by  		designating attendants as independent contractors (ICs). As an IC, the  		attendant (not the consumer) is responsible for withholding and filing all  		federal and state required taxes and insurance. However, closer examination of  		federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor laws and  		regulations has led many analysts to the conclusion that personal care  		attendants are not eligible for independent contractor status (Gibson, 1992;  		O'Neil and Nelsestuen, 1993; Szabo, 1993). Rather, they are likely to be  		considered (by the regulatory authority) to be domestic servants under IRS and  		DoL laws and thus, <i>someone's</i> employees. After a number of years, some  		states found that many consumers and their attendants were not in compliance  		with IRS employment and income tax laws, and in at least one case (e.g.,  		Missouri), a state had to repay back state unemployment insurance (SUTA) taxes  		which represented a significant financial burden for the state. The independent  		contractor issue will be discussed further in <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#tax">Chapter Three</a>.  		It should be noted that some refer to attendants who are employed by a consumer  		rather than an agency as "independent providers." However, this term should not  		be confused with the term "independent contractor," which refers to a person  		who is not an employee of someone else. </p>
<p>As a result of the growing awareness of the applicability of employer  		tax and labor laws to PAS attendants, states have begun to develop strategies  		for effectively addressing the employment tax and attendant management issues  		related to CD-PAS. The goal of these strategies is to assist the consumer to  		assume and manage these employer-related responsibilities rather than having  		the state itself or a traditional home health agency assume the role of the  		employer for the PAS attendant. The centerpiece of this strategy is to develop  		and implement various models of <i>intermediary service organizations  		(ISOs)</i>. This study examined six ISO models: the <i>Fiscal Conduit ISO</i>,  		the <i>IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO</i>, the <i>Vendor Fiscal ISO</i>, the  		<i>Agency with Choice ISO</i>, the <i>Supportive ISO</i> and the <i>Spectrum  		ISO</i>. A detailed description of the characteristics of the CD-PAS programs  		and ISOs examined in this study can be found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  		V.1</a>, <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.2">Appendix  		V.2</a> and <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.3">Appendix  		V.3</a>, respectively. </p>
<h3>II. What Are The Employer-Related Tasks Associated with  		CD-PAS?</h3>
<p>When a consumer chooses to participate in a CD-PAS program that offers  		the highest degree of consumer choice and control (e.g., a cash or  		voucher-based CD-PAS program) there are a number of employer-related tasks that  		he or she may be responsible for, many of which are required by state and  		federal laws and regulations. These tasks can be divided into two categories:  		those related to human resource tasks and those related to employee management  		tasks. The following is a list of the tasks by category. </p>
<p><b>A. Human Resource Related Tasks </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Attendant Recruitment, Hiring and Termination</b></i></p>
<ul><li>develop a job description</li>
<li>advertise the job position or otherwise identify potential  		  candidates</li>
<li>develop an interview protocol</li>
<li>interview potential candidates</li>
<li>screen and evaluate candidates' qualifications (e.g., conduct  		  reference and criminal background checks)</li>
<li>develop candidate selection criteria</li>
<li>select attendant and notify all candidates of consumer's decision;  		  and determine/negotiate wages and benefits with new attendant</li>
<li>supervise the completion and submittal of employment forms including  		  verification of alien status (INS Form I-9), IRS Form W-4 and State employer  		  tax withholding forms</li>
<li>establish/arrange for emergency/back-up attendants</li>
<li>develop criteria for evaluating attendants' performance</li>
<li>issue praise related to good performance, warnings of poor  		  performance and terminate attendant when necessary </li>
</ul><p><i><b>2. Payroll Management and Disbursement</b></i></p>
<ul><li>obtain an employer identification number (EIN)</li>
<li>authorize attendant timesheets and/or vouchers</li>
<li>withhold and deposit state and federal income taxes, if  		  requested</li>
<li>withhold and deposit Social Security and Medicare tax (FICA) and  		  federal and state unemployment tax (FUTA/SUTA) payments</li>
<li>purchase benefits (e.g., worker's compensation, disability, health,  		  life) and manage any withholding of premium payments when applicable</li>
<li>make sure all federal and state DoL laws related to minimum wage,  		  overtime and night attendants are complied with</li>
<li>generate and issue paychecks</li>
<li>issue IRS Form W-2.s annually</li>
<li>inform attendant about the Earned Income Credit provision and manage  		  advanced EIC payments when appropriate</li>
<li>issue bonuses and/or annual pay increases, when appropriate and  		  possible </li>
</ul><p><b>B. Employee Management Related Tasks </b></p>
<p><i><b>1. Attendant Supervision</b></i></p>
<ul><li>make sure that attendant receives any state-required training (e.g.,  		  home health aide or Red Cross training)</li>
<li>develop list of tasks that attendant will perform and any  		  <i>non-negotiable</i> issues (e.g., no smoking) and review them with  		  attendant</li>
<li>develop work schedule with attendant</li>
<li>orient/train attendant regarding when and how required tasks are to  		  be completed</li>
<li>evaluate attendant's performance and provide regular, periodic  		  feedback to attendant </li>
</ul><p>Some public CD-PAS program impose requirements and/or limitations--in  		law, regulation, or informal policy guidelines--on how these tasks are to be  		performed. One example is the requirements and limitations placed on who can be  		hired as a paid attendant. The primary limitations are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Bans or limitations on hiring family members as attendants</i>.  			 States are free to impose any limitation they choose. However, the federal  			 Medicaid law and regulations preclude the hiring and paying of "legally  			 responsible" relatives (e.g., spouses to care for spouses and parents to care  			 for their minor children). The majority of the CD-PAS programs examined in this  			 study imposed some type of limitation on the hiring of relatives as paid  			 attendants. However, state-funded programs afforded the most flexibility in  			 this area. (See  			 <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  			 V.1</a>, Exhibit F).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>A number of states require criminal background checks to be  			 performed and in some cases prohibit consumers from hiring convicted  			 felons</i>. Of the states examined in this study, the states of Idaho and  			 Washington conducted criminal background checks on all prospective attendants  			 and the ISO for the New Hampshire's Medicaid Personnel Care Assistance Program  			 conducts criminal background checks on prospective attendants upon request by  			 the consumer. Other CD-PAS program ISO will assist consumers in conducting them  			 (See <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.2">Appendix  			 V.2</a>, Exhibit J). One of the major findings of this study is that consumers  			 overall were willing to check attendant's personal references. However, they  			 were very reluctant to conduct criminal background checks on prospective  			 attendants. Reasons for this reluctance included: a lack of knowledge regarding  			 how to conduct criminal background checks, a feeling that the process was "too  			 formal" and "implied consumer doubt or suspicion" about the attendant, and that  			 the whole process could would have a negative effect on the consumer's  			 relationship with his or her attendant. In fact, the process of conducting  			 criminal background checks is fairly straightforward and, in some cases, if  			 conducted by a neutral party (e.g., an ISO or state), could protect consumers  			 from experiencing abuse. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some public programs impose mandatory training or certification  		requirements on PAS attendants. Disability advocates believe that consumers  		with disabilities and chronic conditions know their own needs best and,  		therefore, are the most qualified to train their attendants. Moreover,  		mandatory standardized training programs and certification may limit the pool  		of available attendants for hire, especially if there is no funding mechanism  		for covering the cost of training and/or an attendant is not paid while he or  		she attends training. </p>
<p>A countervailing argument is that a standardized training program  		assures all consumers and program administrators that attendants have received  		a basic level of training in key areas of service provision, particularly  		regarding the delivery of personal care and health maintenance activities and  		consumer rights and confidentiality issues. Moreover, many older consumers with  		disabilities and chronic conditions have not been through extensive  		rehabilitation programs and are often not aware of the most appropriate and  		safe methods of providing services. Thus, some consumers feel uncomfortable  		having sole responsibility for training their attendants. </p>
<p>Of the twenty-three CD-PAS programs examined in this study, only five  		programs (22%) required some type of formal training or certification for PAS  		attendants.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> For  		example, the majority of the Maine Medicaid Programs and the state-funded HBC  		Programs (except for the Physically Disabled Program) offer the choice of  		certified nurse aide (CNA) training or competency determined by an RN and the  		consumer and his or her surrogate where appropriate (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  		V.1</a>, Exhibit D). </p>
<p>Attendant supervision is another area where some public programs impose  		limitations or requirements:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Some CD-PAS programs require periodic RN supervision</i>. This  			 used to be a federal Medicaid requirement but this is no longer the case. Many  			 of the CD-PAS programs examined in this study had some RN oversight at least  			 during the initial assessment and periodic reassessment of consumers' services  			 and hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Some CD-PAS programs want to clearly delineate each and every  			 task an attendant may or may not perform for a consumer</i> (e.g., no "heavy  			 cleaning," "no handling of medications," "no child care," "no household help  			 for other family members living in the home"). Some states examined in this  			 study did spell out the "allowable" and "non-allowable" tasks to a certain  			 extent, particularly in the Medicaid-funded programs. In some cases, this study  			 found that it was a good communication and management technique for consumers  			 to "spell out" many of these issues in their contract with their attendant  			 prior to the attendant working for the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Nurse practice acts may proscribe activities that can be  			 performed by attendants</i>. The majority of state Nurse Practice Acts examined  			 in this study contained language proscribing what activities could be performed  			 by an attendant. The most effective mechanism found to make nurse practice acts  			 "CD-PAS friendly" was by exempting CD-PAS from the state's nurse practice act.  			 A less flexible mechanism found was nurse delegation. These issues will be  			 addressed further in <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#effect">Chapter Four</a>. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>C. What Supportive Services Facilitate the Use of CD-PAS?</b></p>
<p>There are a number of supportive services that consumers may wish to  		receive in order to facilitate their use of CD-PAS. These services include, but  		are not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>service assessment and/or case management and service  		  monitoring;</li>
<li>peer counseling and support;</li>
<li>access to employer management skills training;</li>
<li>access to technical skills training for attendants;</li>
<li>access to training regarding employer-related fiscal skills;</li>
<li>access to criminal and certification (e.g., nurse aide registry)  		  checks;</li>
<li>access to an attendant registry; and</li>
<li>access to emergency/back-up attendant services. </li>
</ul><p>One important finding of this report is that no matter which other ISO  		model was used by a CD-PAS program (e.g., Fiscal Conduit, state IRS Employer  		Agent ISO, Vendor Fiscal ISO, Agency with Choice or Spectrum ISO), a key  		element in the ISO's success was whether or not it either had a relationship  		with a free standing Supportive ISO or incorporated supportive services within  		its program design. Thus, the availability of supportive services seems to  		enhance all consumers' access to and use of CD-PAS programs. </p>
<p>This section of the report has provided a complete list of tasks and  		issues that a state CD-PAS program administrator needs to address when  		designing and implementing a CD-PAS program that offers consumers the highest  		level of choice and control. The remainder of this report will focus on  		discussing how the use of ISOs assisted consumers in addressing these issues  		and/or reducing the burden of a number of employer-related responsibilities  		when participating in a CD-PAS program. Finally, the report offers "best  		practice" recommendations for accomplishing these objectives. </p>
<h3>III. What Are Intermediary Service Organizations (ISOs)  		and What Role Do They Play in Facilitating CD-PAS?</h3>
<p>One strategy for facilitating CD-PAS that has emerged from states.  		experience with developing and implementing CD-PAS programs is the use of the  		<i>intermediary service organization (ISO)</i> (Sabatino and Litvak, 1995;  		Flanagan, 1994). A detailed description of the ISOs used by the 23 CD-PAS  		programs examined in this study may be found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.2">Appendix  		V.2</a> and <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.3">Appendix  		V.3</a>. ISOs can provide an array of fiscal and supportive services to state  		(and private) program administrators, consumers and attendants to assist them  		in administering and participating in the CD-PAS programs. ISOs vary in their  		corporate organization, the types of services they provide, the cost of  		administration and the nature of the employer/employee relationship of the ISO  		to the attendant. This study has identified eleven states that use six models  		of ISOs to administer their state and Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs. The ISO  		models examined in this study are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>Fiscal Conduit ISO</i></b>. This model is often used by state  			 and local governments to administer cash grant or voucher CD-PAS programs that  			 allow consumers to receive public funds and pay their attendants directly. The  			 government entity engages an ISO provider to serve as its fiscal conduit  			 primarily for the purpose of disbursing public funds. The Fiscal Conduit ISO  			 provider may also perform a limited number of administrative tasks related to  			 the disbursement of public funds including, but not limited to: (1) the  			 collection and verification of attendants' timesheets and (2) the submission of  			 invoices to a government entity to obtain public funds for disbursement. States  			 may see this ISO model as the most cost efficient method of administering a  			 CD-PAS program, providing consumers with the highest level of consumer choice  			 and control while allowing the state a minimum level of program and fiscal  			 oversight. Thus, this ISO model is for consumers and their surrogates who wish  			 to fully direct their PAS attendants (e.g., be the employer of record, receive  			 a cash benefit, and directly manage and pay their attendant(s)) and for states  			 who wish to achieve the greatest cost efficiency while maintaining a minimal  			 level of day to day program management.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>IRS Employer Agent (EA) Fiscal ISO</i></b>. In this model, a  			 state or local government agency may apply for and receive approval from the  			 IRS (under IRS Revenue Procedure 80-4) to be the "employer agent" on behalf of  			 the consumer for the purpose of withholding and filing attendants' employment  			 taxes (e.g., FICA and FUTA/SUTA), preparing and disbursing payroll checks. The  			 IRS Employer Agent FI may also broker and manage worker's compensation and  			 state disability insurance premiums (where applicable), verify attendants'  			 citizenship/legal alien status and distribute payroll checks to either the  			 consumer or the PAS attendant. States are very concerned that PAS attendants  			 may be deemed "de facto" state employees. Under this model, the government  			 entity may perform these functions and insure accountability for these  			 regulatory requirements without being considered the employer of record of the  			 PAS attendants. The consumer remains the employer of record in this model (as  			 in the Fiscal Conduit ISO model). However, the state plays an active role in  			 the day-to-day management of the program. As a result, the state may experience  			 increased administrative burdens and costs attributable to operating dual  			 payroll systems (e.g., one for state employees and one for CD-PAS attendants  			 and from fielding questions from attendants regarding their employment  			 status.)<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> Contracting  			 with private vendors offers a way to reduce both these burdens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Vendor Fiscal ISO</i></b>. In this model, a private or public  			 vendor or authority may apply for and be approved by the IRS (under IRS Revenue  			 Procedure 70-6) to act as the consumer's fiscal intermediary for the limited  			 purpose of managing employment taxes and brokering/managing benefits, including  			 income tax withholding, FICA and FUTA and SUTA, worker's compensation, state  			 disability insurance premiums (where applicable), verifying of  			 citizenship/legal alien status and disbursing payroll checks to either the  			 consumer or the PAS attendant. In most cases, the consumer remains the employer  			 of record of the PAS attendant, retaining control over the hiring, firing,  			 management and supervision of the PAS attendant. By engaging a Vendor Fiscal  			 ISO provider, the state can remove itself by one level from the attendant, thus  			 reducing its risk of being deemed the attendant's employer.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Vendor Supportive ISO</i></b>. In this model, a private or  			 public vendor or authority may provide supportive services to consumers, and,  			 on a limited basis, to PAS attendants. These services may also be incorporated  			 in the ISO models. The supportive services provided may include: conducting  			 self-direction evaluations of consumers, providing employer skills and  			 self-advocacy training to consumers, assisting consumers with the recruitment,  			 screening and hiring of attendants including conducting background checks and  			 maintaining an attendant registry, and arranging for emergency/back-up  			 attendant staff, determining and reassessing consumers. service needs, and  			 providing or arranging for training opportunities for attendants. Supportive  			 services may also include the provision of case management and monitoring the  			 quality of services provided and consumer and attendant satisfaction. The  			 consumer may or may not be the employer of record of the attendant under this  			 model. The supportive ISO can operates in conjunction with one of the other  			 types of ISOs or supportive services can be offered within an ISO  			 model.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Agency with Choice ISO</i></b>. This model may include a  			 variety of different types of agencies (e.g., Centers for Independent Living,  			 social service agencies such as United Cerebral Palsy and Easter Seal,  			 traditional home health and home care agencies and Area Agencies on Aging) that  			 provide PAS to individuals in a consumer-directed manner. The agency is the  			 employer of record of the attendant. However, the consumer is considered the  			 "managing employer." The key characteristic (and measure of "success") of an  			 Agency with Choice ISO is how committed the ISO is to the Independent Living  			 philosophy and the tenets of consumer-direction. In a highly consumer-directed  			 Agency with Choice ISO (e.g., New York's Concepts of Independence Program or  			 New Hampshire's Medicaid Personal Care Attendant Program), the agency may allow  			 the consumer to recruit, train, supervise and discharge his or her own  			 attendant while the agency acts primarily as the consumer's fiscal agent and a  			 resource for supportive assistance, as needed. Services and level of  			 consumer-direction offered by an Agency with Choice ISO can vary significantly  			 based on the type of administrative entity used (e.g., Center for Independent  			 Living versus home health agency), the primary payor, geographic location of  			 the ISO (e.g., rural versus urban) and type of consumers served (e.g.,  			 self-directing versus cognitively impaired individuals).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Spectrum ISO</i></b>. In this model, the full range of fiscal,  			 supportive and agency-based intermediary services are made available to the  			 consumer under one umbrella CD-PAS program (See <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#figure1">Figure  			 1</a>). For example, a consumer may be the employer of record of his or her  			 attendant and receive cash or a payroll check from the ISO for his or her  			 attendant for PAS provided on weekdays. Then that same consumer may, under the  			 Spectrum ISO, receive consumer-directed agency-based services on weekends and  			 holidays. In short, Spectrum ISO is an operational model that allows a state to  			 create a "seamless" financing and service delivery system for CD-PAS. It also  			 creates the opportunity for consumers to select the intermediary services that  			 "best fit" their needs throughout their lives while enhancing their choice,  			 autonomy and control<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>

<h3>I. Overview of Federal and State Laws Affecting CD-PAS  		Programs</h3>
<p>Consumer-directed personal care services (CD-PAS) are premised on the  		consumer's ability and desire to take charge of the employment relationship and  		to tailor PAS to meet the consumer's personal needs. With increasing control  		comes responsibility for compliance with all laws and regulations affecting the  		employment relationship. A major challenge facing consumers receiving PAS under  		this modality is compliance with the numerous tax and labor law rules (state  		and federal) that apply to household employers. The consumer must either master  		the rules and do the related record-keeping and paperwork or must engage expert  		help to achieve compliance with these rules. </p>
<p>States designing CD-PAS programs for consumers at all levels of desire  		and ability must pay particular care to employment tax and labor laws in an era  		of increasing federal and state concern about benefits for household workers.  		State administrators must first identify the potentially applicable rules and  		then must find optimal ways of ensuring compliance, balancing the consumer's  		desire for independence and control, the state's concern for prudent fiscal  		management of public monies and the attendant's expectation of qualifying for  		job-related credits such as FICA, FUTA/SUTA eligibility and earned income  		credits. CD-PAS consumers are not a homogenous group in terms of desire and  		ability to perform these fiscal and administrative tasks. Thus, the key to  		success for state programs is to build flexibility into the program design,  		emphasizing the independence of those who are willing and able to take on these  		tasks themselves, on the one hand, and providing supportive administrative and  		fiscal services to those who desire to benefit from outside expertise. </p>
<p>This study examined ways in which states could use intermediary service  		organizations (ISOs) to provide consumers desiring such help the expertise and  		administrative efficiency needed for compliance without compromising the  		fundamental premises of the Independent Living philosophy underlying CD-PAS  		programs. The study examined a number of different approaches to the regulatory  		compliance issues, identified outstanding regulatory problems, and developed a  		number of recommendations for best practices. This Chapter will discuss some of  		the important rules affecting CD-PAS household employers and ISOs assisting  		them. <a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#various">Chapter Six</a> will discuss how the particular states  		studied used different ISO models to assist consumers with varying degrees of  		administrative and financial acumen to comply with the laws affecting household  		employees. Together, the recommended best practices and the state experiences  		should provide program administrators with a guide to optimal design of  		effective CD-PAS programs meeting the needs of a variety of consumers. </p>
<h3>II. Tax Rules Affecting CD-PAS Programs: Current  		Issues</h3>
<p>Previous studies of tax laws affecting CD-PAS programs have identified a  		number of important requirements for program administrators to consider and  		incorporate in their CD-PAS program designs and rules.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> The present analysis is based on the  		findings and recommendations contained in these studies, updated to include  		some recent communications from tax and labor authorities as well as reports  		from the field as to the actual policies and practices of CD-PAS programs using  		ISOs. </p>
<p>The regulatory issues discussed in this Chapter are based upon the  		premise that CD-PAS attendants are household employees and not independent  		contractors (i.e., self-employed) for purposes of applicable employment tax and  		labor laws. In the past, some states sought to characterize PAS attendants as  		"independent contractors" in designing their programs, and some may continue to  		do so today. The states' primary purpose in calling the attendant an  		"independent contractor" is to emphasize that the state is not the employer of  		the attendant and does not hold itself out as such. However, when compliance  		issues have arisen (typically in an action commenced by an attendant seeking  		unemployment benefits or worker's compensation from the state), these states  		have found that regulatory authorities look to the facts and circumstances of  		the employment relationship rather than to names or titles in deciding who  		bears the responsibility for complying with the law. </p>
<p>Because the nature of the relationship between the CD-PAS attendant and  		the consumer is such that the consumer typically exercises a considerable  		amount of control and supervision over the attendant: hiring, firing, training,  		managing, it is difficult to argue that the attendant is an independent  		contractor.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> Our  		findings from the field support this conclusion.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>If the attendant is an employee, the consumer is the attendant's  		employer unless the attendant is formally employed by an agency or directly by  		the state. CD-PAS consumers thus join a growing number of householders who find  		that they have a considerable array of tax and labor rules to observe for their  		household employees. While the federal government has tried to extend a helping  		hand to the uninitiated, the responsibilities of employers of household  		employees may seem daunting to some who are seeing them for the first time.  		These requirements are as daunting to a CD-PAS consumer as they are to any  		other household employer, but, like many other Americans, the CD-PAS consumer  		may decide to seek expert help with these rules.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> A "good" CD-PAS program is one that offers  		consumers the level of consumer-direction that they desire while offering  		intermediary services to assist them with these new responsibilities. </p>
<p>The rules, and suggestions on optimal ways to comply with them in CD-PAS  		programs, are discussed below. </p>
<p><b>A. Income, Social Security and Unemployment Tax Issues for Household  		Employees: Overview </b></p>
<p><b><i>1. Income Taxes </i></b></p>
<p>Most employers withhold federal and state income taxes from their  		employees' paychecks, but withholding is optional for "domestic service  		provided in a private home." Where withholding is optional, employees would  		probably prefer that an employer not withhold income tax payments from their  		checks because withholding reduces net take home pay. If the employee wishes  		income taxes withheld, the employee may give the employer a completed Form  		W-4V. In cases where the income tax is not withheld, it must still be paid by  		the employee where tax is due. In any event, the employee must file a federal  		and state income tax return. </p>
<p>The employer, for his or her part, must still report worker income  		annually and provide each employee with a Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) for  		the preceding calendar year by January 31 of the following year.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> Note that even if an attendant were  		considered an independent contractor, the consumer (or his or her agent) would  		still have a responsibility to issue IRS Form 1099 at the conclusion of the tax  		year, sending a copy to the attendant and to the IRS. Finally, whether the  		employer withholds income or not, the employer still has responsibilities to  		certain low-income employees with respect to the Earned Income Credit  		(EIC).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>2. Social Security Withholding (FICA)</i></b></p>
<p>The Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) requires contributions  		from employers and employees to fund social security benefits (including  		Medicare) for future generations. There is a tax on employers and a  		contribution levied on the wages of employees. Household employees are not  		exempt from this levy, and their employers are responsible for the payments and  		the filings. Instructions from the IRS inform household employers that they are  		responsible for both the employee's share of the FICA and Medicare taxes as  		well as their own.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note17">17</a></font></sup>  		The IRS has created special forms and instructions for household employers as a  		result of the Social Security Domestic Employee Reform Act of 1994 (SSDERA),  		simplifying and streamlining the process to dovetail with the individual  		employer's Form 1040 preparation and filing (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendIX.7">Appendix  		IX.7</a> and <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendX.4">Appendix  		X.4</a> for current IRS instructions and publications addressed to household  		employers). </p>
<p><b><i>3. Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA)</i></b></p>
<p>Employers of household workers must withhold and pay federal and state  		unemployment tax (e.g., FUTA and SUTA) for their employees. If an employer pays  		cash wages to a household employee totaling $1,000 or more in <i>any</i>  		calendar quarter, the first $7,000 of such cash wages paid in the taxable year  		are "FUTA" wages and subject to tax. The FUTA tax is currently 6.2 percent of  		the employee's "FUTA" wages. As with the FICA taxes and contributions, the  		filing and payment of unemployment tax by household employers may now be  		accomplished by filling out an IRS Schedule H during the annual income tax  		reporting period, whether or not the employer is required to file an IRS Form  		1040 (See <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendIX.7">Appendix  		IX.7</a>). Individual filers are instructed not to withhold the FUTA tax from  		the employee's wages but to pay it themselves by filling out the appropriate  		lines on Schedule H of the Form 1040. The amount of FUTA tax payable on the  		federal form is reduced by a credit for the amount paid under state  		unemployment tax acts (SUTA payments).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>An alternative method that an employer or fiscal agent may use to report  		attendants' annual FUTA payments is the IRS Form 940 (see  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendIX.9">Appendix  		IX.9</a>). This method allows the employer to adjust for overpayment of FUTA.  		</p>
<p><b>B. Tax Issues Affecting CD-PAS Programs </b></p>
<p><b><i>1. Appointing an Agent: Consumer/Employer May Appoint a Public or  		Private Agent.</i> </b></p>
<p>The foregoing brief review of tax requirements highlights the important  		areas in which compliance must be achieved either directly by the  		consumer/employer or by an agent (ISO). In the context of CD-PAS programs, it  		appears that ISOs can assist the consumer in achieving compliance in a variety  		of different ways. The ISO need not directly perform the regulatory work but  		may simply provide training in budgeting and fiscal management to consumers  		with the desire and ability to do this fiscal and administrative work  		themselves. ISOs may thus provide a range of services depending on the needs  		and desires of the consumer, from direct service (e.g., preparing and filing  		tax returns) to supportive services (e.g., financial counseling, help with  		budgeting). </p>
<p>In cases where the ISO is <i>directly</i> responsible for tax compliance  		on the consumer's behalf, the administrative services may be provided by the  		state agency itself (IRS Employer/Agent) or may be provided by a vendor with  		which the state has contracted (Vendor Fiscal ISO). In both cases, the consumer  		remains the employer of record, managing all day to day aspects of the  		employment relationship with the attendant; the ISO, for its part, stays  		abreast of all regulatory requirements, keeps most of the records, prepares the  		filings and makes the payments. In both cases, the consumer appoints the  		intermediary as tax agent by completing IRS Form 2678 (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendIX.1">Appendix  		IX.1</a>). </p>
<p>In the eyes of the IRS, IRS Employer/Agent ISOs (state agencies) and  		Vendor Fiscal ISOs under contract to state agencies are equally acceptable as  		agents for the consumer/employer. The only difference between the two in terms  		of filing is that vendor fiscal ISOs are responsible by law for filing  		individual copies of Form 2678 (Appointment of Agent) for each consumer they  		represent because they are governed, as are most agents, by the terms of  		Revenue Procedure 70-6. (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendVI.1">Appendix  		VI-1</a>). A subsequent Revenue Procedure (Rev. Proc 80-4,  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendVI.2">Appendix  		VI.2</a>) exempts public agents from this burdensome administrative requirement  		by allowing the public agent filing on behalf of multiple consumers simply to  		attest that Form 2678 has been completed by each consumer for whom the agent is  		filing.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Even though the federal tax authorities are well-prepared to deal with  		cases where the consumer is represented by an agent (public or private), there  		are still a number of complex tax issues arising from the recent amendments to  		the Social Security Act as a result of the SSDERA of 1994 that require  		clarification in order for ISOs to operate effectively and efficiently on  		behalf of the consumer/employer. Issues most commonly raised by states using  		ISOs (public or private) to prepare and file taxes on behalf of consumers are  		discussed below, followed by "best practice" recommendations. </p>
<p><b><i>2. Selected Employment Tax Requirements Affecting Public and  		Private ISOs Acting as Agents</i> </b></p>
<p>The Social Security Domestic Reform Amendments of 1994 (SSDERA of 1994,  		referred to colloquially as the "Nanny Tax" amendments) were aimed at extending  		the benefits of the Social Security Act to persons employed in the home.  		Recognizing that many householders might be daunted by the new filing  		requirements, Congress did two things to alleviate potential difficulties: one  		was substantive and the other was procedural. The substantive "relief" for  		householders consisted of raising of the threshold for compliance with the law  		from $50.00 per quarter to $1000 per employee per year. This meant that the new  		amendments would affect fewer household employers: after 1994, any householder  		paying a household employee <i>less</i> than $1000 per year has no obligation  		whatsoever to make FICA contributions on behalf of the employee.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> The procedural relief consisted of a new  		filing process allowing individual household employers to bypass the quarterly  		filing and depositing rules applicable to most employers and simply to report  		and pay any employment taxes at the end of the taxable year using a new  		Schedule H and filing it along with the householder's Form 1040 (when  		appropriate) or by itself, if no 1040 is due. </p>
<p>But not all householders want to prepare and file their own household  		taxes. How does the new system created by the SSDERA work out in practice when  		the filer is not the individual householder but an agent? This question is of  		particular importance to CD-PAS programs using ISOs. The issues are discussed  		below in subsections a. through n., along with suggested "best practices." </p>
<p><b><i>a. Annual or Quarterly Filing? Effect of $1000  		Threshold for FICA; FUTA Tax Filings Under SSDERA.</i></b></p>
<p>Household employer tax rules, instructions and the forms implementing  		them are geared to the individual filer, allowing the individual household  		employer to make FICA and FUTA payments at the end of the year by filing a  		separate Schedule H with his or her IRS Form 1040, annual income tax return.  		However, the Service recognizes that some household employers are  		publicly-aided individuals represented by a state IRS Employer Agent (public)  		or a Vendor Fiscal ISO (private). IRS Notice 95-18, issued in the year  		following enactment of the SSDERA of 1994, instructs "state and local  		government health and welfare agencies" that they must .report FICA taxes and  		withheld income taxes with respect to these individuals [employees] quarterly  		on a Form 941 and report FUTA taxes annually on a Form 940 (See Appendix VII  		for IRS Notice 95-18).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>However, recent instructions issued by the IRS for individual filers  		seem to suggest that the IRS would accept a Schedule H prepared by filers  		acting as agents for consumers. A special note in the 1996 Instructions for  		Household Employers (<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendIX.7">Appendix  		IX.7</a>) informs household employers that "if a <i>government agency files  		Schedule H for the worker</i>, you do not need to file it." (emphasis added).  		It appears, therefore, that ISOs acting as agents for consumer/employers have  		two options: (1) They can prepare a Schedule H at the end of the taxable year  		for each consumer in the program and send it to the consumer to be submitted  		with the consumer's annual tax return (Form 1040) or, (2) They can follow the  		instructions contained in Notice 95-18, and file employment tax returns  		quarterly on Form 941 (FICA) and annually on Form 940 (FUTA). Each choice has  		advantages and disadvantages for consumers and program administrators. Annual  		filing is discussed first, followed by a discussion of the merits of quarterly  		filing. </p>
<p>What are the advantages of having the ISO prepare a Schedule H to be  		signed and filed by the consumer with the consumer's Form 1040 Individual Tax  		Return? First, there is the advantage of knowing whether or not the $1000  		yearly, per worker, threshold has been met. If the filer can wait until the end  		of the taxable year to file the employment tax information required by Schedule  		H, the consumer and the ISO know which attendants (if any) have met the  		threshold and how much tax is actually due. Second, by waiting until the end of  		the year, the taxpayer (and the employee) have enjoyed the use of the funds all  		during the taxable year instead of having to pay on a quarterly basis. A third  		ostensible advantage is that the single Schedule H obviates the need for filing  		four quarterly reports on Form 941. However, this advantage is diminished in a  		program with many consumers. </p>
<p>Using the Schedule H to report employee wages and related taxes has some  		disadvantages, too. If the ISO (as agent) prepares a Schedule H for each  		individual consumer/employer instead of a quarterly Form 941 on behalf of  		<i>all</i> program participants, the amount of administrative work for the ISO  		is obviously increased compared to the filing of a single Form 941 each  		quarter. Moreover, there is some risk that the consumer/employer may not set  		aside sufficient funds for payment of the tax if allowed to wait until the end  		of the year to meet this obligation. Finally, in large CD-PAS programs  		involving significant amounts of wages to employees considered in the  		aggregate, there is no advance depositing of tax if the filer does not file  		quarterly. This is not a problem for the program, to be sure, but it does seem  		to contradict the implicit assumption in IRS Notice 95-18 that filings will be  		made quarterly by government agencies representing consumers and that deposits  		will follow the rules governing household employers who file tax returns on a  		quarterly basis.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the ISO (public or private) prepares quarterly  		filings, as do most employers of household employees, any disadvantages of the  		Schedule H are eliminated: the ISO ensures that the tax will be paid by making  		advance reports and payments on a quarterly basis, avoiding the risk of  		penalties for late or inadequate payment; the ISO need not prepare individual  		Schedule H forms for each consumer but may report all program wages on a single  		Form 941. The quarterly method is therefore in many ways better suited to  		programs such as CD-PAS programs involving large sums in wages and many  		attendants. </p>
<p>One downside of the quarterly reporting is that take-home pay of  		household employees is reduced by the tax withholding (as it is for most  		employees already). If the rate of compensation is already low, this further  		depression of take home pay (even though attributable to a program designed to  		benefit workers) may make it harder for consumers to attract qualified  		attendants. Another downside of quarterly reporting is the ISO may have to send  		refund checks to employees who have not met the $1000 threshold by the end of  		the taxable year. </p>

</tr></table><p><b><i><a name="section3.II.B.2.b" id="section3.II.B.2.b">b. Deposit Rules for  		Quarterly Filers</a></i></b></p>
<p>Employers (or their agents) filing quarterly reports of FICA and FUTA  		taxes withheld must not only prepare quarterly reports on Form 941, but must  		also comply with the rules on depositing withheld employment taxes (See IRS  		Publication 15 Circular E: Employer Tax Guide in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendX.6">Appendix  		X.6</a>; IRS Notice 95-18 in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendVII">Appendix  		VII</a>). What is the impact of this requirement on state IRS Employer-Agent  		ISOs and Vendor Fiscal ISOs? </p>
<p>IRS Notice 95-18 states that "taxpayers who file Forms 941 (FICA) and  		940 (FUTA) must pay or deposit FICA and FUTA taxes and any withheld income  		taxes for the household employees in accordance with the rules that apply to  		payment and deposit of those taxes with respect to employees who are not  		household employees." Depending on the amount of withheld tax accumulated, the  		quarterly filer may have to deposit as often as semiweekly or monthly. This  		means that ISOs (public or vendor) who prepare the tax filings and accumulate  		withholding payments on behalf of consumers in the program must be prepared not  		only to file quarterly tax reports, but may have to make frequent deposits  		depending on how much money is accumulated in withheld tax.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>c. Who Applies for the Employer Identification  		Number (EIN) and Does It Matter Whose EIN is Used?</i></b></p>
<p>IRS Notice 95-18 instructs public agencies representing consumers to  		obtain a <i>separate</i> Employer Identification Number (EIN) for the filings  		made quarterly on behalf of consumers. The purpose of the separate number is to  		avoid confusion between the state in its capacity as <i>agent</i> for the  		consumer and the state in its capacity as the <i>actual</i> employer of  		attendants (which it is not in the case of CD-PAS programs in which the  		consumer is the employer). Nonetheless, some states are reluctant to apply for  		and use a separate EIN when acting in the capacity of the consumer's agent even  		though IRS Notice 95-18 explicitly authorizes this practice. Even though the  		separate EIN does not make the state the employer of the attendants, states are  		leery of using it. </p>
<p>Michigan actually lists two EINs on each quarterly filing it makes for  		the consumers in its program: its filings apparently list both the state's EIN  		and the EINs of the individual consumers. Virginia, which employs a vendor to  		prepare the employment tax filings, lists only the EIN of the vendor and not  		the State's EIN. The states' reluctance to use the separate "agent" EIN is  		understandable, but it can lead to administratively burdensome practices (such  		as Michigan's) or practices that do not conform to the advice provided in IRS  		Notice 95-18. </p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>d. Must the ISO issue a Form W-2 Representing Wages  		from Each Consumer Served by an Attendant?</i></b></p>
<p>ISOs (public or private) standing in the shoes of the consumer  		(employer) must send the employee a Form W-2 by January 31 of the year  		following the year in which the services were performed. If the employee  		performed services for more than one consumer/employer, it follows that  		multiple W-2.s must be issued, each reflecting only those wages attributable to  		that employer. </p>
<p>The importance of correctly handling this matter cannot be  		overemphasized. If the ISO issues only a single W-2 reflecting <i>total</i>  		compensation earned by the attendant from the program, even though the  		attendant may have worked for several consumers, the aggregate program wages  		earned in a given year are likely to exceed the $1000 threshold imposed by the  		Social Security Domestic Reform Act (SSDERA). If the ISO calculates withholding  		based on this aggregated amount, the FICA calculation may be erroneous because  		no FICA is due in a given case unless the attendant has earned $1,000 or more  		from a given consumer. While aggregation would be beneficial to workers who  		earn small amounts from a number of different employers, Congress specifically  		rejected proposals to aggregate wages for purposes of calculating FICA. Thus,  		to comply with the letter and spirit of the law as it is currently written,  		ISOs must issue separate wage statements (Form W-2) reflecting wages  		attributable to individual consumer/employers. </p>
<p>Questions that have arisen with respect to the issuing of Form W-2 have  		not been answered definitively or systematically by the IRS. Field interviews  		with program administrators indicate that different practices are being  		followed in the various state programs. Some states appear to be over-reporting  		qualifying wages by aggregating attendants' program earnings and reporting them  		on a single W-2. Other states have sought the advice of regional IRS officials  		and are reporting wages per consumer on individual W2, resulting in the issuing  		of multiple W-2s to a single attendant. While this has occasionally caused  		confusion to the attendant, the practice has resulted in more accurate  		estimates of qualifying wages.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>

<p>As the representative of the consumer, the ISO must notify attendants of  		their eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Certain low income wage  		earners (those with a "qualifying child") may be entitled to advance payment of  		the credit. The ISO must therefore comply with all EIC notice requirements (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendX.3">Appendix  		X.3</a>, <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendX.5">Appendix  		X.5</a>. <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendX.7">Appendix  		X.7</a>. and <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendX.8">Appendix  		X.8</a> for IRS instructions and publications regarding the EIC) and must also  		be prepared to calculate and advance the credit to an employee who is eligible  		and who submits Form W-5 asking for advance payment (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA2.htm#appendIX.6">Appendix  		IX.6</a> ). The amount advanced may be deducted from the employment tax  		withheld for that employee. The income countable for purposes of the credit  		(whether paid in advance or not) is the employee's total expected annual  		income. The intermediary, in these situations, is far better situated than the  		individual consumer to be able to determine whether or not the attendant's  		total yearly income would make him or her eligible for the credit. </p>
<p>Interviews with program administrators indicated that states and their  		contracted vendors were just beginning to grapple with the practical and  		administrative implications of administering the EIC, (in particular the  		advance payment aspect of the law). The program administrator for the State of  		Michigan was aware of the issue and reported that the state (as employer/agent  		under Revenue Procedure 80-4) was working on better ways of informing  		attendants of their potential eligibility for the EIC. This administrator was  		aware that there is a notice concerning the EIC on the back of Form W-2, but  		noted that only a few attendants had made inquiries about the applicability of  		this credit. Program administrators in Washington State had received only one  		inquiry about the EIC from an attendant, but were nonetheless consulting with  		regional IRS offices in Seattle to devise a way of handling such requests  		efficiently from the standpoint of the employer/agent ISO. </p>

<p>There are at least two occasions when a consumer may make additional  		out-of-pocket payments to their attendants. The first is when a CD-PAS program  		uses a sliding fee scale where the consumer, depending on his or her income, is  		required to pay a copayment for CD-PAS received. The second is when a consumer  		makes additional out-of-pocket payments to his or her attendant in addition to  		the hourly wage established by the CD-PAS program in order to compete for  		qualified attendants or to retain an attendant who might otherwise leave. All  		such payments (if not strictly proscribed by program rules specifying that the  		rate is full payment for the services) should be included in the calculation of  		any income for purposes of FICA and FUTA/SUTA thresholds (and, of course, for  		income tax purposes). None of the states studied in this project identified  		this as an issue for individual consumers or for ISOs, nor had any state  		developed policies and procedures for keeping track of such payments for tax  		accounting purposes. </p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>g. How Should "Stipends" be Treated for Tax  		Purposes?</i></b></p>
<p>Most CD-PAS programs pay personal care attendants on an hourly basis.  		However, some programs (such as adult foster care) pay the attendant/provider a  		lump sum on a monthly basis to provide personal care to a consumer. When the  		consumer is living in the attendant's/provider's home (such as in the case of  		adult foster care), the stipend received by the attendant/provider is excluded  		from the attendant's gross income under Section 131 of the Internal Revenue  		Code ("Difficulty of Care Payments"). But no such favorable treatment exists  		for payments to attendants if the consumer lives in his or her own home. CD-PAS  		program staff from two programs, the New Hampshire Personal Care Attendant  		Program and the Idaho CD-PAS program, believe that the current rules  		effectively limit the consumers' choice regarding where they can live,  		especially those consumers who prefer to live in their own homes. These program  		administrators believe that the tax status of these stipends favor caregivers  		who serve the consumer in their homes and create a disincentive or barrier for  		consumers who prefer to receive PAS in their own homes. </p>
<p>There are two other technical issues that need to be addressed related  		to stipends. First, in some states a stipend can include funds to cover respite  		care for the primary attendant/provider. These funds are not tax exempt. The  		attendant/provider then takes these funds and hires and pays the respite  		worker. Some state Divisions of Employment Security (SUTA) have examined the  		FUTA/SUTA tax payment histories of these respite workers and have found many of  		them not to be in compliance. In some cases the Division collects 10 percent of  		the stipend each month until the taxes are paid in full. </p>
<p>Second, in some states the consumers pay their adult foster care  		providers a monthly payment to cover their share of room and board from their  		personal resources (such as SSI/SSRI). These funds are not tax exempt and  		attendant/providers must report them as miscellaneous income annually on their  		IRS 1040 and state income tax forms. Failure to do so will result in the  		attendant/provider being out of compliance with state and federal income tax  		rules. </p>

</tr></table><h3>III. Department of Labor Rules Affecting CD-PAS  		Programs</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>Previous studies of federal labor laws affecting CD-PAS programs have  		identified a number of important requirements for program administrators to  		consider and incorporate in the design and rules pertaining to their state  		and/or Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs. This study's analysis is based on the  		findings and recommendations contained in these studies, updated to include  		recent communications from tax and labor authorities as well as reports from  		the fields as to current policies and practices of CD-PAS programs that use  		ISOs. </p>
<p>As discussed previously in this report, personal care attendants (PCAs)  		are classified as domestic servants under the Department of Labor's (DoL) Fair  		Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This section will address minimum wage and overtime  		rules outlined in FLSA as they pertain to domestic servants, two exemptions to  		the federal minimum wage and overtime rules as they pertain to companions and  		live-in help, payment for night attendants and OSHA related issues. </p>
<p><b>B. Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay </b></p>
<p>Minimum wage and overtime requirements are set (as a floor) by FLSA and  		states may have stricter requirements of their own (e.g., the federal minimum  		wage is currently $5.15/hour, whereas Massachusetts' minimum wage rate is  		$5.25/hour). There is no federal requirement to pay overtime for time worked on  		weekends and holidays, nor if more than the usual number of hours are worked on  		a given day in the work week as long as the employee works no more than 40  		hours in a week. However, employers must pay at least the federal minimum wage.  		If the employee works more than 40 hours in a single week, the employer must  		pay overtime (one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate paid to the  		employee for each additional hour worked). PAS attendants appear to be covered  		by the FLSA unless the services they provide can be characterized under two  		exemptions: (1) <i>companionship</i> services or (2) <i>live-in help</i>  		services. These exemptions now exist in federal law, but may not necessarily be  		followed by all states as state DoL law may be more beneficial to the worker.  		</p>
<p>No CD-PAS program examined in this study had a compliance issue related  		to paying PAS attendants the federal minimum wage.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> In fact, in all cases where the federal  		minimum wage applied, programs paid in excess of the federal minimum wage (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  		V.1</a>, Exhibit F). </p>
<p>Regarding the payment of overtime, only five (22 percent) of the 23  		CD-PAS programs studied reported that they paid PAS attendants overtime  		pay.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> It should be  		noted, however, that the CD-PAS programs that did not pay overtime were most  		likely not out of compliance due to the fact that the majority of the PCAs  		working in these programs would qualify as <i>companions</i> under FLSA's  		<i>companionship services for the aged or infirm exemption</i> which insulates  		the consumer/employer from paying minimum wage and overtime. However, very few  		CD-PAS program and ISO administrators interviewed knew of the DoL  		<i>companionship</i> services and <i>live-in help</i> exemptions, their effect  		on the payment of minimum wage and overtime for PCAs, nor did they know that  		the PCAs participating in the programs may well have qualified for these  		exemptions. Instead, CD-PAS program and ISO administrators gave other reasons  		for not paying overtime rates of pay to PCAs. </p>
<p>In some cases, such as New Hampshire's Medicaid Personal Care Assistance  		Program, attendants are not allowed to work more than a total of 40 hours in a  		given week, eliminating the need for overtime pay. In the case of the Michigan  		Home Help Program, program administrators discourage PAS attendants from  		working more than 40 hours to prevent worker "burn-out" and the deterioration  		of the quality of PAS. In New York, the Concepts of Independence Program relies  		on a state labor law that precludes paying overtime to this category of worker.  		However, this state labor law could easily be superseded by a ruling in a  		worker challenge that finds this state law inconsistent with FLSA. Because so  		many state program administrators were unaware of the application of these DoL  		exemptions and their possible application to PAS attendants, a full discussion  		of these exemptions appears below. </p>
<p><b>C. Companionship Exemption </b></p>
<p>From the description of the duties of the attendants in all of the  		CD-PAS programs studied, it appears that an argument can be made that the work  		of most, if not all, PCAs would qualify as <i>companionship</i> service under  		the terms of 29 CFR 552.6, <i>companionship services for the aged or  		infirm</i>. This regulation specifies that the term applies to "services which  		provide fellowship, care, and protection for a person who, because of advanced  		age or physical or mental infirmity, cannot care for his or her own needs." The  		regulation goes on to state that such services may include household work  		related to the care of the aged or infirm person such as meal preparation, bed  		making, washing of clothes and other similar services." The regulation further  		states that such services may "<i>also</i> include the performance of general  		household work" provided that such work is "incidental" (i.e. does not exceed  		20 percent of the total weekly hours worked). The use of the word <i>also</i>  		in this context seems to suggest that there is a difference between "household  		work" and "general household work" since the sentence using the term "household  		work" does not contain any limitation whatsoever, whereas the sentence using  		the term "general household work" limits such work to 20 percent of the total  		hours worked per week. </p>
<p>The regulations note that services to this same population which  		"require and are performed by trained personnel such as a registered or  		practical nurse" cannot be embraced within the scope of the exemption. Again,  		this requirement would not affect personal care attendants, who are not  		"trained personnel" within the meaning of the regulation. The duties they  		perform are not "required to be performed by trained personnel." The fact that  		trained professionals may also perform such duties does not mean that such  		duties may not be performed by the personal care attendant. Consumers and  		attendants interviewed reported that these are duties which are performed by  		the attendant acting as an extension of the consumer, "another pair of hands",  		as one attendant put it. Unless state nurse practice acts are amended to take  		such duties out of the purview of personal care attendants and place them  		exclusively within the jurisdiction of licensed or registered nurses, the  		companionship exemption should insulate consumers/employers from the overtime  		requirement for the small number of attendants who put in more than forty hours  		a week for an individual consumers.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One program studied (GA Medicaid Independent Care Waiver Program)  		included both a companion and PCA option. The companion performed only basic  		household tasks, whereas the PCA performed personal care, health maintenance  		and household tasks. Companions were reimbursed $15,000/year plus room and  		board, whereas, PCAs were reimbursed $6-8/hour. It is difficult to compute an  		hourly wage for companions working in this program since their hours varied and  		often they did not work a traditional 40 hour week. </p>
<p><b>D. Live-In Help Exemption </b></p>
<p>Attendants who reside in the household where they are employed are  		exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act by virtue  		of Section 552.102. However, they must be paid the minimum wage for each hour  		worked unless they are classified as "companions." Most attendants do not live  		in the household of their employers. However, some attendants in the CD-PAS  		programs studied did. For example, GA Medicaid Independent Living Program, the  		Maine Medicaid Elderly Waiver Program and the HCB Elderly and Other Physically  		Disabled Programs use the live-in help category. However, Health Resources of  		Maine (HRM), Inc., the ISO for a number of the Maine programs, is phasing out  		its live-in provision due to wage issues raised by the state's Division of  		Employment Security. </p>
<p><b>E. Provision for Night Attendants </b></p>
<p>Some attendants work in the consumer's household throughout the night.  		The attendant may be asleep for part of each night shift. It is common practice  		to pay such attendants a lump sum per night for that shift. According to DoL  		rules, that lump sum amount, divided by the total hours the worker is on duty,  		must yield the allowable minimum wage per hour because federal labor  		regulations specify that sleep time for employees working less than a 24 hour  		shift is compensable as long as the person is on duty (29 CFR 785.21). A number  		of CD-PAS programs reviewed utilized night attendants. These individuals were  		paid a lump sum amount that ranged from $9.00 to $15.70/night (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  		V.1</a>, Exhibit F). Since it could not be discerned how many "sleep" hours  		were computed into these rates, it is difficult to determine whether the CD-PAS  		programs were in compliance with DoL rules. However, it is very important for  		CD-PAS program and ISO administrators to make sure that the night rates paid to  		PCAs are in compliance with the DoL rules pertaining to this work category.  		</p>
<p><b>F. OSHA </b></p>
<p>In 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH ACT), 19 U.S.C. 651  		et seq. was enacted with the goal of providing American workers with a safe and  		healthful work place. Pursuant to the OSH Act, the Occupational Safety and  		Health Administration (OSHA) was created as an agency of the Department of  		Labor to monitor and enforce work place safety and health.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> The OSHA issues that  		particularly apply to CD-PAS programs and PCAs are the regulations on  		ergonomics (e.g., transferring techniques), infectious diseases and blood borne  		pathogen control. In cases where a state had a mandatory training requirement  		for PCAs and when a CD-PAS program used the Agency with Choice ISO model, PCAs  		received training on OSHA related issues. However, when there was no mandatory  		state PCA training requirement and/or the consumer was the employer of record  		and responsible for training his or her attendant, PCAs received less training  		regarding OSHA related issues. The debate continues regarding the provision of  		mandatory basic PCA training. However, there is an argument in favor of  		requiring all PCAs to receive some type of basic training in order to protect  		the health and safety of both the consumer and his or her PCA. </p>

</tr></table><h3>IV. States Worker's Compensation and Disability  		Insurance Laws and Their Effect on CD-PAS Programs</h3>
<p><b>A. State Worker's Compensation Insurance Law </b></p>
<p>Worker's compensation insurance laws are state laws that establish basic  		<i>quid pro quo</i> programs. Under worker's compensation laws, an employee  		agrees to relinquish his or her right to sue his or her employer for damages  		arising from injuries on the job in return for receiving prompt payment of  		benefits related to medical care and loss of income due to an injury on the  		job. Each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the  		Virgin Islands has a worker's compensation program. However, some states  		provide small employers exemption from otherwise applicable worker's  		compensation laws. For example, in Missouri, employers need not pay worker's  		compensation insurance benefits if they have fewer than four employees, whereas  		in New Jersey, an employer of even a single employee must provide worker's  		compensation insurance benefits. </p>
<p>State worker's compensation insurance laws place the responsibility for  		compliance on employers. Since many ISOs are not the employer of record of the  		attendant, they have no duty to arrange or pay for a worker's compensation  		policy to cover consumers. PAS attendants. Notwithstanding the lack of legal  		duty to provide this benefit, twelve (52%) of the 23 CD-PAS programs reviewed  		provided worker's compensation insurance coverage to PCAs. The ISO model most  		likely to offer this benefit was the agency with choice ISO (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  		V.1</a>, Exhibit G). It should be noted that the State of Maine made the policy  		decision to provide worker's compensation insurance coverage for PCAs in all of  		its state and Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs (with the exception of its cash  		benefit HBC Physically Disabled and Voucher Programs) so that attendants would  		receive a basic level of benefits (e.g., FICA, FUTA/SUTA and worker's  		compensation insurance). </p>
<p>The number of worker's compensation claims reported by CD-PAS program  		and ISO administrators in this study was extremely low. Only one worker's  		compensation case was reported in the three states. CD-PAS programs reviewed  		that used an IRS/EA Fiscal ISO Model and one from the nine CD-PAS programs  		reviewed that used an Agency with Choice ISO model. One reason given was that  		the majority of attendants had not experienced a work-related injury. Another  		reason given was that many PCAs did not have the knowledge or the financial  		resources to file a claim. A third reason given was that the consumer's income  		and assets were very low, making any efforts to file a claim against the  		consumer not worthwhile. However, when an Agency with Choice ISO was the  		employer of record of the PCA, even though few claims were filed, there was  		considerable apprehension about the potential cost implications of such claims.  		</p>
<p>The State program administrator for the Michigan Home Help Program  		reported one case related to worker's compensation. In this case, a PCA filed a  		claim and the court ruled that the State was the employer of record for the  		purpose of paying worker's compensation benefits. The State responded to this  		decision by covering the PCA's medical expenses through the State's Medicaid  		program without claiming federal matching funds for the related expenses. This  		case did not lead to subsequent cases and the state currently does not extend  		worker's compensation insurance benefits to PCAs. </p>
<p>The Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) in Maine historically were the ISO for  		three of the state's CD-PAS programs. As a result of the filing of a worker's  		compensation by a CD-PAS attendant, the AAAs' experience rating increased,  		causing the price of a worker's compensation insurance policy to increase. A  		number of AAAs decided not to continue to serve as ISOs and the state  		subsequently decided to contract with Health Resources of Maine (HRM), Inc., to  		be an agency with choice ISO for these programs. Currently, HRM, Inc. offers  		worker's compensation insurance benefits to its PCAs and a number of AAAs  		subcontract with HRM for PCA services for their clients. </p>
<p><b>B. State Disability Insurance Law </b></p>
<p>Five states -- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island  		-- and Puerto Rico have statutes establishing state disability insurance  		programs.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> Under such  		laws, employees and, in most cases, employers must pay a special tax to fund  		the program or pay for private insurance coverage that meets state requirements  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>Generally, disability insurance programs are coordinated with a state's  		worker's compensation and/or unemployment insurance programs, so in most cases,  		both taxes or premiums are paid at the same time under the particular state  		statute's definition of "employer" and "employee." In general, employment  		paying less than $1000 in wages in a calendar quarter is exempt, although some  		states have lower dollar-amount thresholds. In New York, employers of domestic  		workers in a private home need not pay temporary disability benefits tax unless  		they have employed one or more workers for forty hours per week for at least  		four weeks, and at least thirty days in the calendar year.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> Of the twenty-three CD-PAS  		programs studied, only the New York Concepts of Independence Program is obliged  		by state law to provide disability insurance to its PCAs and the program is in  		full compliance with this state law. </p>

</tr></table><h3>V. Verifying Citizenship or Legal Alien Status</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>Employers, including employers of domestic workers (e.g., personal care  		attendants), must verify and maintain records (e.g., completed INS Form I-9)  		showing that each employee hired after November 7, 1986, is a U.S. citizen, a  		national of the U.S., or a legal alien who is authorized to work in the U.S.  		</p>
<p>The employment verification process requires that an employer have the  		worker complete and sign the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Form  		I-9 within three business days from the date of hiring. The worker must show  		the employer both identification and employment eligibility documents from an  		approved list detailed on Form I-9. After examining the documents, the employer  		completes the employer's section of the Form I-9. If the worker cannot provide  		the documents in three days, he or she must provide proof of application for  		the documents within the three days and the actual documents within 90 days of  		hire. The completed Form I-9 is not filed with the government; rather, the  		employer keeps it as an employment record for at least three years after the  		date of hiring or one year after the employment is terminated, whichever is  		later. </p>
<p>The obligation doesn't apply to <i>casual employment</i>, which is  		defined as including "employment of individuals who provide domestic service in  		a private home that is sporadic, irregular, or intermittent." However, these  		terms are not further defined in regulation (Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>Failure of an employer to comply with the verification and record  		keeping requirements can result in fines ranging from $100 to $1000 for each  		violation. Moreover, an employer who hires a person known to be an unauthorized  		alien can be punished by a fine of $250 to $2,000 for the first offense, with  		higher fines applicable to subsequent offenses, and criminal penalties if  		convicted of a "pattern or practice" of knowingly hiring illegal aliens  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>All of the CD-PAS programs studied were in full compliance with the  		Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the regulations regarding the  		employment verification process. However, CD-PAS program and ISO administrators  		should make sure this process is in place when designing a CD-PAS program and  		that there is full compliance when the program is operational. </p>

<p><b>A. Relationship of Nurse Practice Acts to CD-PAS Programs </b></p>
<p>Nurse practice acts are state laws that govern the profession of  		nursing. These acts define the practice of nursing, set educational standards  		for nurses and set forth licensing standards for the profession. They may also  		cover the relationship of the nursing profession to other health professions  		and will usually specify what steps will be taken if someone is found to have  		engaged in the practice of nursing without having obtained a license. Part of  		the research in the eleven states in this study consisted of collecting  		information about the impact of nurse practice acts on the design,  		administration and implementation of CD-PAS programs with intermediary service  		organizations (ISOs).<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most states' nurse practice acts were drafted decades before the concept  		of consumer-directed personal services developed as a program philosophy and  		service paradigm. Kane et al. (1995) observe that nursing "policy and  		regulations did not anticipate the possibility that a large number of  		individuals unrelated to the consumer, and not licensed as nurses, might have a  		role in providing routine nursing services."<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> As discussed below, even though nurse  		practice acts purport to address only the practice of nursing, the scope of the  		terms "nursing" or "practice of nursing" as used in these acts may profoundly  		affect the consumer's ability to employ an individual not licensed as a nurse  		to serve him or her. Unless specifically modified to take into account the  		desire of consumers to use unlicensed personnel at home or at work to assist  		them in a variety of tasks, nurse practice acts may therefore conflict, or  		appear to conflict, with CD-PAS program design, goals and philosophy. </p>
<p>The purpose of this Chapter is to discuss the issues raised by state  		nurse practice acts, and to make recommendations based on findings from  		interviews with program administrators and personnel from Boards of Nursing. A  		detailed description of the findings from the eleven state study is found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXIII">Appendix  		XIII</a>. Charts depicting exemption and delegation provisions in these states  		are found in <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXIV">Appendix  		XIV</a>. This analysis is enriched by material from earlier studies of the  		issues, including a comprehensive study by Sabatino and Litvak (1995) and a  		study by Rosalie Kane and her colleagues (1995) surveying delegation practices  		in twenty states. This area of the law is currently in considerable flux as  		policymakers in many states have begun to reexamine nurse practice laws (and  		other licensing and certification laws) in light of evolving concepts about  		service design, cost and philosophy in programs for persons with disabilities.  		</p>
<p><b>B. CD-PAS Attendants and Nurse Practice Acts </b></p>
<p><b><i>1. Who are CD-PAS Attendants and What Tasks do They Perform?  		</i></b></p>
<p>CD-PAS attendants may be young, old, family members, friends, skilled or  		relatively unskilled. Some may be certified to perform certain services (e.g.  		as certified nurse assistants or CNAs); others lack any formal credential. But  		whatever their individual characteristics and skill levels might be, PAS  		attendants are <i>not</i> licensed or registered nurses. They are called  		variously (depending on the state) home care workers, private duty homemakers,  		home health aides, in-home care providers, chore workers or auxiliary workers.  		A number of states (e.g., Nebraska and Missouri) use the general term  		"unlicensed assistive personnel" to describe any non-professional, unlicensed  		attendant performing services in the home of the consumer. </p>
<p>The CD-PAS attendant is, above all, someone chosen by the consumer to  		meet his or her <i>individualized</i> service needs. There is no single set of  		services that fits every individual with a disability. Flexibility is a  		hallmark of consumer-directed personal assistance programs: the attendant  		performs whatever personal assistance services are needed to allow the consumer  		to live at home, go to school or go to work just as an able-bodied person  		might. No one consumer is like any other: each has individual service needs and  		specific preferences regarding the type of caregiver and the type of care to be  		received, including needs and preferences that are related to the maintenance  		of health and physical condition. The question of whether or not such services  		can be performed <i>only by a nurse</i> is therefore one of great moment for  		any consumer who wishes to have such service performed by an unlicensed  		personal care attendant. </p>
<p><b><i>2. Tasks Performed by CD-PAS Attendants that May Potentially or  		Actually Conflict with Nurse Practice Acts or Regulations </i></b></p>
<p>Just as the names for these attendants vary from state to state, so do  		the skill or training requirements for such attendants.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> There is also considerable variation in the  		list of tasks program designers expect attendants to perform for consumers.  		Indeed, it is a cornerstone of the Independent Living Movement philosophy that  		the attendants' tasks are to be defined by the consumer and may include  		whatever personal services are needed to enable the consumer to live daily  		life, go to school and work. Of course, the more broadly the attendant's role  		is defined, the more likely it is that the attendant's job description may  		embrace tasks that may be thought to fall within the definition of "nursing" or  		"practice of nursing" as those terms are used in many of the nurse practice  		acts. </p>
<p>In a 1988 survey of one hundred thirty-three PAS programs in the United  		States, the World Institute on Disability (WID) found that many PAS programs  		offered assistance with services that nurses may also perform, depending on the  		scope of some of the terms used. The numbers of PAS programs offering these  		services show that so-called "health maintenance activities" commonly form part  		of the expected services of many PAS attendants. A 1990 WID survey and study of  		PAS programs<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> found  		assistance offered in proportions as follows: </p>
<ul><li>bowel and bladder care (73%) </li>
<li>prosthesis assistance (66%) </li>
<li>range of motion (63%) </li>
<li>menstrual assistance (63%) </li>
<li>foot care (63%) </li>
<li>assistance with medications (57%) </li>
<li>assistance with respiration (48%) </li>
<li>assistance with catheterization (38%) </li>
<li>assistance with injections (33%) </li>
</ul><p>Citing this study in their 1995 analysis, Sabatino and Litvak note that  		is not clear whether any or all of these tasks, if performed by a PAS  		attendant, would be considered "nursing" care within the meaning of a given  		state's nurse practice act and regulations. Some of them more obviously fall  		within the meaning of such terms (e.g., assistance with injections;  		catheterization) and others might not, depending on what the attendant actually  		does (e.g., bowel and bladder care). However, in the absence of clear  		definitions and guidelines, there may be a potential conflict between nurse  		practice laws and the operation of a CD-PAS program any time a consumer's  		service needs require the attendant to provide services that relate to health.  		Two ways of resolving potential conflicts between CD-PAS program regulations  		and state nurse practice acts are discussed below. </p>
<h3>II.  Exemption and Delegation Under Nurse Practice  		Acts: Implications For CD-PAS Programs</h3>
<p><b>A. Exemption and Delegation: Two Approaches to Reconciling Nurse  		Practice Acts with CD-PAS Program Goals </b></p>
<p>Even at the time most nurse practice acts were written, legislative  		drafters saw the need for exceptions to prevent these statutes from having an  		impact beyond the intended area of regulation, Thus, many states created  		specific exemptions or exceptions that put certain <i>persons</i> (by  		<b>exemption</b>) or <i>conduct</i> (if the task is <b>delegated</b> by a  		licensed professional) outside the scope of the statute. The older exceptions  		reflect the drafters. awareness of the types of other caregivers and other  		caregiving situations that existed at the time that these acts were drafted;  		the newer exceptions have been crafted with specific programs in mind,  		including CD-PAS programs in some cases. </p>
<p>In their comprehensive survey of nurse practice acts, Sabatino and  		Litvak (1995) list the common exceptions to nurse practice acts that could be  		construed to apply to CD-PAS attendants and the services they perform. These  		are exceptions for: (1) care provided by friends and family; (2) care provided  		by domestic servants; (3) domestic administration of family remedies; (4) care  		provided by an employee of an institution; (5) care provided under the  		direction of a registered nurse (commonly referred to as "delegated" care) and  		(6) care under the order of a licensed physician or other personnel. Of these,  		all but the fifth (delegated care) excepts a specific <i>class of persons</i>,  		rather than allowing the <i>conduct</i> itself. </p>
<p>The distinction between exemption and delegation can be important in  		terms of defining the issues which confront policymakers seeking to design  		effective, workable CD-PAS programs. When it is the <i>conduct</i> which is  		permissible because a nurse has <i>delegated</i> the performance of the task to  		another (such as a PAS attendant), a multitude of questions arise, of which the  		following<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note35">35</a></font></sup> are but a  		partial list: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Is the nurse permitted under the statute to delegate the  			 task?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To whom is it lawful to delegate? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the person to whom the task was delegated competent to perform  			 the task? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under what conditions can the unlicensed person perform the task?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the condition of the patient permit delegation or does the law  			 restrict delegation only to cases where the patient was "stable" or had  			 "predictable health care needs"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What tasks may be delegated? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May delegation be general or categorical or must some tasks be  			 delegated only on a patient or task-specific basis? </p>
</li>
</ul><p>If, on the other hand, a <i>person or class of persons</i> is  		<i>exempt</i> from the regulatory limitations of a state's nurse practice act,  		there are still a host of questions to answer, but they differ from those  		arising under <i>delegation</i>. They concern, among other things, (a) the  		scope of the exemption (i.e. does it fit the activities of the PAS attendant?)  		and (b) the application of other laws and rules that may still regulate  		services or assistance related to health (such as specific rules on  		administration of medication not codified in the nurse practice act itself).  		</p>
<p><b>B. Which is the Better Approach for CD-PAS Programs: Exemption or  		Delegation? </b></p>
<p>To begin with, it must be recognized that policymakers may not have a  		choice of which route to pursue to resolve potential conflicts between nurse  		practice acts and CD-PAS program design. Many states have already chosen a  		particular method of reconciling actual or potential conflicts between nurse  		practice acts with rules governing programs using unlicensed personnel. Idaho,  		for example, has chosen to deal with its unlicensed assistive personnel by  		delegation and has struck a successful balance between the licensing laws and  		the requirements of a service program that must extend into every corner of a  		state with many rural districts and serve consumers of widely varying abilities  		and conditions. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, considered delegation,  		developed proposed regulations and then decided to defer implementation,  		relying instead upon an exemption. New York has also resolved potential  		controversies through a specific exemption. A full discussion of the specific  		approaches taken by the states in this study is found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXIII">Appendix  		XIII</a>. Charts depicting the characteristics of states' exemption or  		delegation rules are found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXIV">Appendix  		XIV</a>. </p>
<p>If policymakers still have a choice, there is a good deal to be said in  		favor of creating a well-designed exemption for consumer-directed personal  		service attendants. A simple, narrowly drafted exemption such as New York  		State's (See discussion in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXIII">Appendix  		XIII</a>) insulates the CD-PAS program from future regulatory changes initiated  		by licensing boards. It lays to rest issues such as the uncertainty over what  		tasks may and may not be performed by unlicensed assistive personnel and/or the  		conditions of performance. It saves the cost of administering delegation rules,  		which often require considerable record-keeping, professional nurse time, and  		the time of the attendant (for training, demonstration of competence). Finally,  		the exemption for CD-PAS programs supports the goals of independence and  		individual choice (including the choice of attendant and services) that are  		central to the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
<p>However, legislative exemptions may not be as easy to obtain as changes  		in nurse practice or licensing regulations, depending on the process in the  		individual state. Moreover, an exemption covering only CD-PAS programs leaves  		other groups still subject to the licensing laws, creating a distinction which  		some might see as unfair. Some statutes allow exemptions only if the person  		performing the services is not compensated. This means those who can be served  		by family members and friends need not be concerned about the licensing laws,  		but those who must pay for services must either employ a nurse directly or  		accept services only if there has been formal delegation. One interviewee  		observed that the distinction between paid and unpaid attendants disfavors  		publicly-aided consumers, whose attendants must be compensated. Where  		delegation is permitted, such individuals could be served by attendants to whom  		a nurse has delegated the performance of tasks falling within the definition of  		nursing. If the statute does not permit delegation of nursing tasks and no  		exemption is available, the program is faced with the risk of  		noncompliance.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Other arguments put forward in favor of delegation stress the  		relationship of delegation to quality services. Proponents of delegation argue  		that exempting unlicensed assistive personnel from the licensing laws may  		result in the program's losing an opportunity to improve the quality of service  		available to consumers, maintaining that quality of care can be enhanced if  		nurses become involved in providing instruction and oversight. Nurses'  		contribution may be lost or diminished if an exemption insulates the program  		from participation by nursing professionals. Future studies of this complex  		issue in the different states over the years will provide evidence on this  		point. At the moment, it is hard to judge exactly how the quality of CD-PAS  		programs will be affected by participation or lack of participation by  		registered or licensed nurses because there is no one definition of program  		quality that all advocacy groups can agree on. One indirect effect on quality  		which might result from ongoing discussions about nursing delegation might be  		an increased effort to certify or credential personal care attendants.  		Delegation may boost this effort because of nurses' reluctance to delegate  		nursing tasks to untrained individuals.<sup><font><a href="consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-key-operational-issues-state-cd-pas-programs-using-intermediary-service-organizations.html#note37">37</a></font></sup> Findings from this study suggest that in  		states where delegation is allowed, there are stricter training or  		certification requirements for attendants than in other states. This trend is  		likely to continue. </p>
<p>Proponents of delegation emphasize lower cost, equity, increased  		efficiency and choice. The cost arguments favoring delegation compare the cost  		of service as delegated by nurses to assistive personnel with the costs  		incurred by the program if the nurse provided the service directly. However, as  		compared to outright exemption of CD-PAS attendants from the licensing laws,  		implementing nurse delegation will probably add to program costs, especially  		where delegation protocols involve strict requirements for supervision,  		recordkeeping, evaluation and monitoring. The choice argument made by  		proponents of delegation is linked to the cost argument: lowering program costs  		means that individuals can live in the setting of their choice. The strength of  		this argument depends on a comparison between costs of residential long term  		care and the costs of living in the home and receiving services from assistive  		personnel to whom nursing tasks have been delegated. In terms of this  		comparison, choice is indeed increased. However, the greatest amount of  		consumer choice occurs in situations where the chosen attendant is also free of  		the training, monitoring, evaluation and record keeping requirements that are  		features of many delegation protocols. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, delegation works well in a number of states and may work  		successfully in others. Good delegation protocols take considerable time to  		develop and require the cooperation of many individuals with diverse interests.  		If policymakers prefer to choose this approach to harmonizing the licensing  		laws with CD-PAS program requirements, there are many advantages, not the least  		of which is the lessening of uncertainty about the application of these laws to  		personal care attendants. If possible, the scope of the activities should be  		narrowly defined so that the statute does not inadvertently sweep in routine  		services under the definition of nursing. Policymakers should also consider the  		impact of proposed delegation protocols on cost and program administration.  		Finally, policymakers choosing this approach should think carefully about the  		impact of proposed delegation protocols on CD-PAS program goals and philosophy  		before they sit down to participate in the large task forces that are usually  		gathered to draft these statutes. Nothing is more difficult than trying to  		write regulations to implement an ill-conceived statute. Appropriate goal  		setting, planning and thinking ahead will save trouble later by ensuring a  		workable and sensible law from the start. </p>
<h2><a name="contract" id="contract">CHAPTER FIVE. EFFECTIVE USE OF CONTRACTS TO  		FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF CD-PAS PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<h3>I. Introduction: Use of Written Contracts Helps CD-PAS  		Programs Achieve Their Objectives</h3>
<p>Well-designed CD-PAS programs emphasize both the independence desired by  		the consumer as well as the responsibilities that go with the increase in  		independence and authority. Study of the different models of CD-PAS programs  		using ISO, sought to discover, among other things, whether, and how, contracts  		apportioning the rights and duties of intermediary, consumer and attendants  		facilitated these multi-party relationships. The study revealed considerable  		variation in the scope and subject matter of the contracts examined. However,  		it did appear that the very process of expressing rights, duties,  		responsibilities and expectations on paper was generally beneficial in helping  		the parties achieve the balance between independence and responsibility that  		worked best for all. </p>
<p>Discussions and examples suitable for the different ISOs are found in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXV">Appendix  		XV</a>. The following is a brief discussion of the nature of contracts and why  		they are important in facilitating CD-PAS. </p>
<h3>II. Using Contracts in CD-PAS Programs </h3>
<p><b>A. What is a Contract? </b></p>
<p>Simply put, a contract is an "agreement between two or more persons or  		parties to do or not to do something" (Webster's Third International  		Dictionary). Contracts are sometimes referred to by other terms (e.g.,  		"memorandum of understanding"; "agreements"), but whatever they are called, a  		contract exists when two or more parties agree to do something (or to refrain  		from doing something). In the context of this report, the model contracts  		described are documents which express the intent of parties participating in a  		consumer-directed personal service program with intermediary support. These are  		complex relationships involving multiple parties and inter-related duties and  		responsibilities. </p>
<p><b>B. Why Are Written Contracts Necessary? </b></p>
<p>Most contracts are expressed in written form, although not all are. The  		more complex the relationship, the more important it is to express the parties'  		promises to one another in writing. Moreover, if a contract is to be relied on  		when a dispute arises as evidence of what the parties expected from one  		another, it is obviously better to have the agreement expressed in writing."  		</p>
<p>A well-drafted written contract achieves its objectives by:(1)  		expressing the expectations of the parties clearly; (2) reflecting the current  		state of the law that governs the relationship of the parties and (3) correctly  		apportioning responsibility and liability. Where multiple parties are involved,  		with different duties and expectations for each party, it is well worth the  		time to put the contract into words. </p>
<p><b>C. Who Should Sign the Contract? </b></p>
<p>The contract should be signed and dated by the parties making the  		promises. Most contracts are two-party contracts (e.g., consumer-attendant;  		consumer-intermediary; state-intermediary). Thus, the contract between a  		consumer and an attendant should be signed by both the consumer and the  		attendant. The signature indicates that the person signing is making a formal  		promise. It is helpful to have the signature line preceded by a clause reciting  		that the person signing has read and understood the terms of the agreement.  		Contracts need not be witnessed to be valid. </p>
<p>Even though there are only two formal parties to most CD-PAS agreements,  		it is helpful for each contract, agreement or written policy to reference the  		roles of other parties in the CD-PAS relationship. Contracts and policies  		should cross reference each other where necessary and should be drafted so that  		they are mutually consistent. If, for example, the consumer-employer uses an  		intermediary to perform payroll functions and comply with regulations, the  		consumer's contract with the <i>attendant</i> should specify that these  		employer functions are the responsibility of the <i>intermediary</i>, and not  		the <i>consumer</i>. The attendant is thus put on notice that questions arising  		from this aspect of the employment relationship are to be handled by the  		intermediary and not the consumer, whereas supervision and control of the day  		to day work is to be handled solely by the consumer. </p>
<p><b>D. What are the Important Matters that Should be Covered in CD-PAS  		Contracts? </b></p>
<p>In general, every contract governing a CD-PAS relationship (e.g.,  		consumer-attendant; consumer-intermediary) should cover the following broad  		areas: </p>
<ul><li>Purpose of the contract or agreement; </li>
<li>Roles of the parties; </li>
<li>Qualifications of the parties (including any representations about  		  skills and abilities; </li>
<li>Duties/tasks to be performed by parties; </li>
<li>Tasks specifically not to be part of contract or agreement; </li>
<li>Wages and benefits (for contracts with attendants) including  		  disclaimer or notice of benefits <i>not included</i> in the total compensation  		  package; </li>
<li>Administrative fee (e.g., for contracts between state and vendors);  		  </li>
<li>Conduct constituting breach, including language that addresses:
<ul><li>consequences of breach: discipline or termination (attendants)  				</li>
<li>standards that must be met (state with vendors); </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Termination and/or Modification of Contract; and </li>
<li>Term of the Contract. </li>
</ul><p><b>E. Must All Aspects of the CD-PAS Relationship be Described in a  		Written Contract? </b></p>
<p>There are many aspects of the CD-PAS relationship that might benefit  		from being expressed in writing, but not all need be detailed in a formal  		contract. It is helpful, for example, to list consumer preferences regarding  		how specific tasks should be done. One consumer interviewed drew up such a  		list. She gives it to all potential attendants so that they can decide if they  		can meet her expectations. The advantage of such a list is that it can be  		modified easily, whereas modification to a contract requires the consent of  		both of the parties. </p>
<p>Other matters that are helpful to put in writing, but which need not be  		part of a written document include, whom to contact in an emergency and  		procedures to follow in the event that the consumer is hospitalized or becomes  		temporarily unable to direct his or her attendant. </p>
<h3>III. Conclusion</h3>
<p>Contracts that clearly spell out the duties, rights, responsibilities  		and expectations of the parties to these new and evolving relationships  		facilitate the efficient operation of CD-PAS programs that use ISOs. Although  		it takes time to draft a good contract, this is time well-spent that can do  		much to anticipate and avoid future problems. Although no contract model fits  		all of the CD-PAS program relationships, a number of models are offered in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA3.htm#appendXV">Appendix  		XV</a>, along with a discussion of their merits.</p>
<h2><a name="various" id="various">CHAPTER SIX. HOW WELL DO THE VARIOUS ISO MODELS  		ASSIST STATE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTATING CD-PAS  		PROGRAMS AND CONSUMERS IN USING CD-PAS?</a></h2>
<h3>I. Overview</h3>
<p>This study has demonstrated the utility of employing various models of  		intermediary service organizations (ISOs) to improve the delivery of CD-PAS  		services to persons of all ages with disabilities and chronic conditions.  		However, no ISO model is optimal for every CD-PAS consumer. This is because, as  		in the general population, the characteristics of persons with disabilities  		vary from person to person. The two principal consumer characteristics CD-PAS  		administrators must focus on when designing CD-PAS programs are the (1)  		consumer's <i>desire</i> and (2) <i>ability</i> to perform the wide range of  		employer-related tasks associated with CD-PAS. This study examined the  		effectiveness of six ISO models in balancing individual consumers' desire and  		ability to perform the CD-PAS employer-related tasks independently with the  		states' desire to provide appropriate PAS to beneficiaries while ensuring  		regulatory compliance, program accountability, quality PAS and consumer health  		and safety. </p>
<p>Each ISO model was evaluated in terms of its performance related to  		specific evaluation criteria. These were access, program and cost efficiency,  		compliance/accountability, degree of consumer-direction afforded to consumers  		and level of administrative responsibility for the consumer. </p>

<h3>II. Fiscal Conduit ISO</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>A consumer participating in a CD-PAS program that uses a Fiscal Conduit  		ISO typically is the employer of record of his or her attendant(s). The  		consumer (or surrogate) is solely responsible for all employer-related tasks.  		He or she may or may not wish to receive supportive services (such as  		employment tax and payroll management training) to perform these functions. In  		the three study states that used a Fiscal Conduit ISO (i.e., Massachusetts.  		Medicaid Personal Care Attendant Program, Maine's Home Based Care (HBC)  		Physically Disabled Program, and the cash option of Pennsylvania's Attendant  		Care Program), supportive services were available. Moreover, in the case of the  		Maine and the Massachusetts CD-PAS programs, consumers were required to  		successfully complete CD-PAS skills training in order to participate in the  		program. Supportive services were provided using two distinct ways. In the case  		of Maine and in some cases in Pennsylvania, a separate Supportive ISO (i.e., a  		Center for Independent Living) provided the services. In the case of  		Massachusetts, the fourteen .PCA Agencies. provided both the fiscal and the  		supportive intermediary services. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>B. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility </b></p>
<p>Almost by definition, a Fiscal Conduit ISO is best suited to  		self-directing consumers who exhibit a very high level of desire and ability  		because this ISO offers consumers the maximum amount of choice and control. Two  		of the three programs studied (i.e., Maine and Pennsylvania) required consumers  		to be self-directing to be eligible for the CD-PAS program. As a result, such a  		program tends to have a limiting effect on access. For example, there are only  		135 consumers participating in the Maine HBC Physically Disabled Program and  		only a handful currently participate in the Pennsylvania's cash option program.  		Initially, Massachusetts enrolled only self-directing consumers in its PCA  		Program. However, in 1981, the State expanded program eligibility to persons  		with both physical and mental disabilities (Nadash and Flanagan, 1996). As a  		result, program enrollment soared to the current level of approximately 3,700  		consumers. A variety of issues developed related to program accountability,  		quality of PAS and consumer health and safety and program administrators now  		express doubt that all consumers currently enrolled are equally capable of  		meeting the demands of the program. As a result, Medicaid PCA program staff are  		in the process of revamping the current CD-PAS program to introduce greater  		administrative control than has been available through the Fiscal Conduit ISO  		model. </p>
<p><b>C. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></p>
<p>Efficient Fiscal Conduit ISOs can limit the state's administrative tasks  		and the associated costs of the CD-PAS program. The greatest cost efficiencies  		are achieved by states who know what they wish to purchase from Fiscal Conduit  		ISOs and have several potential contractors bidding to provide the designated  		services. Contracting with a small number of qualified vendors enables the  		state CD-PAS program agency to be able to effectively monitor vendor  		performance. For example, Massachusetts contracts with 14 Fiscal ISOs whereas,  		Maine contracts with only one. When the Maine contract for the Fiscal  		Conduit/Fiscal ISO for three CD-PAS programs recently went out for rebid, the  		state had little choice in selecting vendors since only the current Fiscal ISO  		(i.e., Alpha One) submitted a bid. However, CD-PAS program staff in  		Massachusetts reported significant variability in the fourteen PCA agencies'  		performance and ability to meet state program requirements. By contrast, Maine  		CD-PAS program staff noted that an advantage of having one vendor was, .that  		you can know every detail of their operation and monitoring their performance  		closely.. This same level of vigilance is often necessary to monitor ISOs'  		commitment to consumer-direction, which is the keystone of CD-PAS programs.  		</p>
<p>Although it was not possible to cost out all the administrative fees  		that were paid to three states. ISOs in a standardized manner in order to  		compare these fees across CD-PAS programs, the per diem rates of the PAS  		provided by CD-PAS programs that used Fiscal Conduit ISOs and related  		supportive services in the aggregate were lower than the average per diem rates  		of payment established by the study states for Medicaid home health and related  		personnel. </p>
<p>In the Fiscal Conduit ISO model, compliance with all regulatory  		requirements is left to the consumer (or the surrogate in the case of  		Massachusetts) who may not or may receive supportive services to assist with  		these tasks. The downside of this practice is that, if enough consumers fail to  		properly discharge their responsibilities, regulatory authorities will seek to  		hold the state accountable even though the consumer is the employer of record  		and the state is not. For example, in Massachusetts the State's Division of  		Employment Security (DES) has had cases where PAS attendants (considered  		independent contractors in the state) have filed for unemployment insurance  		benefits. In such cases, DES has challenged the independent contractor status  		and looked for some entity to pay the back unemployment insurance tax.  		Realizing that consumers seldom, if ever, have these monies, DES would like to  		look to the state to pay these taxes since they are the original source of the  		funds. To date, the state has not made any back payments related to  		unemployment insurance tax. However, DES is trying to determine what the  		employer-employee relationship for these cases will be in the future and who  		should be responsible for these tax payments. </p>

</tr></table><h3>III. IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>Three of the eleven states studied have implemented the IRS Employer  		Agent Fiscal ISO model to enhance their CD-PAS program: Idaho, Michigan and  		Washington State. In all three cases, the choice of this ISO model was urged  		upon the states by regional IRS officials in order to resolve pending cases  		related to employer tax compliance. All three states were persuaded to become  		agents for eligible consumers under the terms of IRS Revenue Procedure 80-4 to  		ensure future years' employment tax compliance. As in the Fiscal Conduit ISO  		model described earlier, the consumer is the employer of record of his or her  		attendant(s). As the employer, the consumer may appoint an agent for purposes  		of preparing employment tax filings. This agent may be public (state agency) or  		a private vendor. In states, (including the three studied), that use an IRS  		Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, the state agency itself is the ISO. The states,  		therefore, enjoy the maximum level of administrative and program control in  		this ISO model. However, this same level of control increases the risk that the  		state may be perceived as the responsible party in any employment related  		dispute even though the consumer is the employer of record. Although this ISO  		model offers fiscal and administrative services, none of these states provided  		supportive services to consumers participating in the CD-PAS program other than  		a basic program orientation. </p>
<p><b>B. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility </b></p>
<p>CD-PAS programs that use IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISOs can serve a  		broader range of consumers (e.g., those with high ability and low desire or low  		ability and high desire) than CD-PAS programs using a Fiscal Conduit ISO  		because this ISO performs the most challenging employer-related task: managing  		the payroll (i.e., FICA, FUTA/SUTA, and any benefits) and issuing paychecks for  		attendants while providing consumers with a high level of consumer-direction.  		For example, a consumer may have a high ability to perform the necessary  		employer-related tasks, but may be employed or attending school and not have  		the time available to manage these additional tasks. Another consumer may have  		a developmental disability that has prevented him or her from having extensive  		life experience in home finance and/or employee management, yet may have a  		great desire to participate in a CD-PAS program. By providing the appropriate  		fiscal services, this ISO model affords such consumers the opportunity to  		participate in a CD-PAS program, thereby increasing program access while  		maintaining a high level of consumer choice and control. It should be noted  		that all three states that use Fiscal IRS Employer Agent ISOs allowed consumers  		with surrogates to participate in the CD-PAS programs, providing greater access  		to consumers than programs or ISOs which do not allow use of a surrogate. </p>
<p><b>C. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></p>
<p>Where the state itself is the Fiscal ISO, fiscal accountability is  		assured. More problematic is the issue of cost efficiency. None of the three  		states examined could give an estimate of the costs associated with performing  		the ISO functions. Moreover, it is uncertain whether states can achieve cost  		efficiencies through the use of existing state personnel and systems. </p>
<p>With regard to program efficiency, two of the three states reported  		encountering difficulties arising from operating dual payroll systems: one for  		persons employed directly by the state and the other for persons employed by  		program beneficiaries (i.e., Idaho, Michigan). In particular, Michigan and  		Idaho found that issuing an IRS Form W-2 for each consumer-PCA relationship was  		a great burden and therefore, are currently issuing one Form W-2 per attendant  		listing total program wages, contrary to current IRS rules. This practice,  		while administratively efficient for the ISO, may confer Social Security  		credits to noneligible attendants (e.g., those earning less than $1,000/year).  		Washington State, on the other hand, made the investment to develop a separate  		payroll system for managing CD-PAS attendants. reimbursement and has reported  		good results. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>States that wish to implement the  			 IRS Employer Agent ISO model need to examine their existing payroll and fiscal  			 accounting systems to assess their ability to accommodate the separate  			 accounting and regulatory requirements for CD-PAS attendants. If a state's  			 current systems can not accommodate the new and required functions, a state  			 needs to assess the financial and operational feasibility of developing the  			 additional capabilities. Finally, if the systems modifications are not  			 operationally and/or financially feasible, then the state should consider  			 implementing a Vendor Fiscal ISO model.</font></td>
</tr></table><h3>IV. Vendor Fiscal ISO</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>Four of the twenty-three CD-PAS programs studied have implemented the  		Vendor Fiscal ISO model: Maine's Medicaid CD-PAS Program and the Medicaid  		Physical Disabled Waiver Program, Missouri's Personal Care Assistance Program  		and Virginia's Personal Assistance Services Program. This ISO model is similar  		to the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO model in every respect except one: the ISO  		is a private vendor with which the state has a contract rather than the state  		agency being the ISO itself. In all four CD-PAS programs, the consumer is the  		employer of record and must be able to self-direct his or her own attendant(s)  		and services. The Vendor Fiscal ISO performs all payroll functions (including  		managing FICA, FUTA/SUTA and other benefits such as worker's compensation,  		where applicable) and check preparation and disbursement tasks as the agent of  		the consumer. Therefore, the state CD-PAS program agency enjoys somewhat less  		control than if it performed these functions itself. However, what the agency  		loses in terms of direct control, it gains in terms of insulation from the  		reality and the appearance that it is the responsible party in any  		employment-related disputes arising between the consumer-employer and the  		attendant. The state may also achieve some administrative efficiency by using a  		Vendor Fiscal ISO. </p>
<p><b>B. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility </b></p>
<p>The level of access to the CD-PAS program for consumers is similar to  		that found in the CD-PAS programs that use the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO.  		In both cases, allocating these administrative/fiscal tasks to the ISO means  		that consumers who have neither the desire nor the ability to perform these  		tasks can receive CD-PAS services without assuming this level of  		responsibility. At the same time, such consumers, who are the employers of  		record, can manage all other aspects of the employment relationship with their  		attendants (e.g., recruitment, hiring, training, managing and discharging  		attendants). It should be noted that all four CD-PAS programs that used the  		Vendor Fiscal ISO model restricted access to the program to self-directing  		consumers only, whereas the CD-PAS programs that used the IRS Employer Agent  		Fiscal ISO.s allowed consumers with surrogates to participate. This one feature  		of these four CD-PAS programs could be seen as a possible limitation on  		consumer access. It may be that the requirement prohibiting surrogates was used  		as a "screen" to assure the state that the consumers participating were able to  		manage the requirements of participating in the CD-PAS program. </p>
<p><b>C. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></p>
<p>States in the study that used Vendor Fiscal ISOs reported that they  		achieve a high level of program efficiency by employing private vendors to  		administer the intermediaries services related to the CD-PAS program. By  		contracting with a vendor, these states were able to avoid the confusion (and  		related inefficiencies) that arose in states that performed these functions  		themselves. Moreover, states using contracted Vendor Fiscal ISOs were satisfied  		with the price paid for these services. In all cases studied, the total CD-PAS  		per diem rates, including the administrative costs associated with the Vendor  		Fiscal ISO and Supportive ISO, where applicable, were lower than the Medicaid  		rates of payment for home health aides and related personnel in each study  		state. </p>
<p>Although the various Vendor Fiscal ISOs used different methods to  		achieve compliance with regulatory requirements, all states reported a high  		level of satisfaction with the vendors' performance with regard to compliance.  		Even though the Vendor Fiscal ISOs were solely responsible for these important  		administrative tasks, the states studied all reported that they believed public  		funds were being responsibly administered and accounted for. It appeared from  		interviews with program administrators that the surest way to achieve program  		accountability was to incorporate strong, testable performance standards in the  		vendors' contracts. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Vendor Fiscal ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>Vendor Fiscal ISOs offer states  			 many advantages in terms of administrative and cost efficiencies while  			 reflecting a high level of consumer-direction for consumers.

</tr></table><h3>V. Agency with Choice ISO</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>Nine of the twenty-three CD-PAS programs studied used the Agency with  		Choice ISO model. In this model, the ISO is the employer of record of  		consumers' attendants and the consumer is the <i>managing employer</i>, often  		having the option to select, in some cases train, supervise and discharge his  		or her attendant(s). As the employer of record, the agency is responsible for  		the majority of the administrative and fiscal employer-related tasks. However,  		the number of tasks can vary significantly depending on the degree of  		consumer-direction and control permitted by the ISO to the consumer. For  		example, in most of the CD-PAS programs that use an Agency with Choice ISO, the  		consumer can refer an attendant for employment by the agency. However,  		according to a number of Agency with Choice ISOs interviewed, when the choice  		is given to a consumer to identify his or her own attendant, the consumer often  		reports that he or she doesn't have a candidate and so the ISO refers its own  		staff to the consumer for approval and then handles the majority of the  		employer-related tasks. </p>
<p>In contrast, consumers in the New York Concepts of Independence Program  		manage all employer-related tasks with the exception of managing payroll and  		preparing payroll checks for their attendants. In addition, once Concepts  		prepares an attendant's check, it is sent to the consumer to distribute even  		though the agency is the legal employer of the attendant. When consumers  		participating in the NY Concepts of Independence Program were asked what role  		Concepts had in managing their attendants, consumers reported that "Concepts is  		<i>just</i> my fiscal agent." Similar responses were recorded from the  		consumers who participated in the New Hampshire Medicaid Personal Care  		Assistance Program. These findings demonstrate that even though a CD-PAS  		program uses the Agency with Choice ISO model, the CD-PAS program can still  		offer a high level of consumer choice and control and its services can  		appropriately reflect the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
<p><b>B. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility </b></p>
<p>Access to CD-PAS programs was found to be greatest and the consumer  		population the most diverse (particularly in terms of age and type of  		disability) when the Agency with Choice ISO was used. The New Hampshire  		Self-Determination Project, administered by Monadnock Developmental Services in  		Keene, New Hampshire, found this model to be very effective in providing CD-PAS  		to persons with mental retardation and cognitive impairments. All of the CD-PAS  		programs, with the exception of the NY Concepts of Independence Program, allow  		consumers with surrogates to participate in the CD-PAS program and a number of  		states allow children and elders to participate (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.1">Appendix  		V.1</a>, Exhibit C). Moreover, Concepts of Independence is now developing the  		program capacity to allow consumers with surrogates to participate in the  		program. Agency with Choice ISOs afford consumers with little desire and/or  		ability to manage the employer responsibilities the option to assume the least  		number of employer-related administrative responsibilities, depending on the  		CD-PAS program and ISO (e.g., an elder who may wish to select his or her  		attendant and supervise his day to day activities in his or her home but have  		the ISO manage the other responsibilities). </p>
<p>However, the level of consumer-direction and commitment to the  		Independent Living philosophy can vary significantly from ISO to ISO under this  		model. This study found that Agency with Choice ISOs that were based in the  		traditional home health agency model often offered a lower level of  		consumer-direction than those that were Centers for Independent Living (CIL)  		based. The study also found that the greater the number of Agency with Choice  		ISO operational in a state, the greater the level of consumer-direction varied  		from ISO to ISO. Also, the greater the number of such ISOs, the more difficult  		it was for state CD-PAS program agencies to monitor the ISOs' commitment to the  		Independent Living philosophy and the level of consumer-direction afforded to  		consumers. For example, Pennsylvania has sixteen Spectrum ISOs operating in the  		state that offer a wide range of intermediary services including Agency with  		Choice. When a traditional home health agency-based ISO was interviewed, staff  		reported that "many of our consumers really don't want a lot of choice" and it  		was not clear what level of effort was made to encourage consumers to try a  		more consumer-directed option. </p>
<p>Finally, this study found that Agency with Choice ISOs that  		subcontracted with other agencies to provide PAS services also had difficulty  		monitoring subcontractors' commitment to consumer-direction. In Pennsylvania,  		an Area Agency on Aging (AAA), acting as a Spectrum ISO, subcontracted with  		local agencies to provide agency-based PAS to eligible consumers. One consumer  		interviewed used agency-based PAS exclusively and had no idea of the options  		available to her. When she (and her son who held a durable power of attorney)  		were asked if she would like to receive fiscal intermediary services and hire  		and manage her own attendants, they responded enthusiastically in the  		affirmative and asked why they were never told about this option before. The  		executive director of the AAA, realizing that consumers were not consistently  		being informed of their intermediary service options, addressed the problem by  		actively advocating for and implementing a CIL in the area which would provide  		the fiscal and supportive intermediary services to eligible consumers in the  		area. </p>
<p><b>C. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></p>
<p>Overall, Agency with Choice ISOs ranked high regarding program  		efficiency. However, all ISOs studied, including Agency with Choice ISOs, that  		required consumers to establish and implement their own "back-up" plans for  		relief attendants, found that often consumers did not successfully manage this  		requirement. In the case of the Maine CD-PAS programs that HRM, Inc.,  		administered, HRM staff reported that consumers were responsible for  		establishing and implementing their own "back-up" attendant relief plans  		"because it was a consumer-directed PAS program." However, staff reported that  		often these plans did not work. This study recommends that CD-PAS programs  		revisit the issues of attendant relief and try to develop plans where the ISO  		and the consumer work together so that attendant relief can be accessed  		consistently by consumers. </p>
<p>Conventional wisdom would predict that Agency with Choice ISOs are the  		least cost effective of all the ISO models. However, this study found that this  		was not always the case. All of the CD-PAS programs in the study that used the  		Agency with Choice ISO had PAS per diem rates (including administrative fees)  		that were lower than the comparable Medicaid rates for home health aides and  		related personnel in each of the study states. In particular, NY Concepts of  		Independence administered the CD-PAS program, provided payroll services, an  		attendant search "hot-line," consumer-employer training and provided attendants  		with a full range of benefits for $10.98/hour, less than the average Medicaid  		home health aide per diem rate. Moreover, the program's consumer population has  		a very high acuity level (Concepts serves a significant number of consumers who  		are quadriplegics on ventilators). This study found that when agencies were  		developed for the specific purpose of managing a CD-PAS program, state agencies  		could negotiate rates for program administration and PAS that were consistently  		more competitive than those of traditional home health agencies. This is true,  		in part, because the state did not have to compete with the rates of payment  		paid for home health aide services paid for by the Medicare program. </p>
<p>On the whole, Agency with Choice ISOs offer states a high degree of  		compliance with regulatory requirements and program and fiscal accountability.  		State program agencies can effectively monitor the administration of the  		program and the services rendered best when there are a limited number of  		agencies under contract. However, the level of consumer-direction afforded to  		consumers by these agencies can vary significantly, particularly when the  		primary ISO subcontracted with other agencies to provide PAS to eligible  		consumers. </p>

<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>This study found that supportive intermediary services were provided  		either by a stand-alone Supportive ISO (i.e., the Maine HBC Physically Disabled  		Program the Medicaid CD-PAS and the Medicaid Physically Disabled Programs, the  		Missouri Personal Care Assistance Program and the Virginia Personal Assistance  		Services Program) or within the range of services offered by an ISO (i.e., the  		Massachusetts Medicaid Personal Care Attendant Program which is a Fiscal  		Conduit ISO or NY Concepts of Independence which is an Agency with Choice ISO).  		The supportive intermediary services offered to consumers in these CD-PAS  		programs were varied, ranging from the provision of consumer-employer skills  		training to assisting consumers with recruiting their attendant(s), evaluating  		consumers' needs for PAS and providing case management services (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.2">Appendix  		V.2</a>, Exhibit J). The study also found that Supportive ISOs that were CILs  		were the most effective in providing these services and advocating for the  		consumer regarding their CD-PAS (i.e., the Missouri, Virginia and Maine  		Programs). </p>
<p><b>B. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility </b></p>
<p>In general, the availability of supportive services, regardless of the  		ISO used, enhanced consumers' ability to participate successfully in a CD-PAS  		program, thus enhancing consumer access. CD-PAS programs that offered  		supportive services, (in particular, consumer-employer training), could afford  		consumers a high level of consumer-direction and help them better manage their  		CD-PAS responsibilities. </p>
<p>In the case of CD-PAS programs that used a Fiscal Conduit ISO, the  		availability of consumer- employer training was the key to consumers' success  		in the program. However, even with this training, the number of consumers  		participating in a CD-PAS program that used a Fiscal Conduit ISO with  		supportive intermediary services was small (i.e., the Maine Home Based Care  		Physically Disabled Program). </p>
<p>In all cases, consumers interviewed were reluctant to perform criminal  		background checks. This study recommends that a CD-PAS program's supportive  		intermediary services include assistance for the consumer in conducting and  		evaluating criminal background checks on their potential PAS attendants. </p>
<p><b>C. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></p>
<p>This study showed that supportive intermediary services provided by a  		separate Supportive ISO or within one ISO (i.e., a Fiscal ISO or an Agency with  		Choice) could be equally effective as long as the proper consumer-directed  		philosophy was applied by the ISO. This study found that supportive services  		administered by CILs were highly effective, possibly because of the CILs'  		commitment to the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
<p>Regarding cost efficiency, fees for supportive services tended to be  		unbundled (i.e., a rate for skills training, another for evaluating and  		reevaluating consumers. PAS needs) and fees varied significantly from ISO to  		ISO (See <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.2">Appendix  		V.2</a>, Exhibit K). This study recommends that state CD-PAS programs  		re-examine how they reimburse ISOs for supportive services and consider  		negotiating a bundled supportive service rate in order to give ISOs the  		incentive to provide supportive services as needed rather than to maximize  		program revenues. </p>
<p>This study found that the supportive services provided by the CD-PAS  		programs studied did enhance compliance and accountability, particularly for  		CD-PAS programs using the Fiscal Conduit ISO model. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Supportive ISO</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font> Supportive services, whether  			 offered by a "stand-alone" support agency or as part of an ISO's service  			 package, are highly effective in enhancing consumers' access to and success  			 with CD-PAS programs. The key to the effectiveness of these services seems to  			 be the spirit in which the services are provided, not the institutional setting  			 or organizational framework. If the provider of supportive services adheres to  			 the Independent Living philosophy, consumers' access to and participation in  			 CD-PAS programs are enhanced. Fees do vary significantly and must be  			 effectively negotiated and monitored in order for the state CD-PAS program  			 agency to be a prudent buyer of these services. This study recommends  			 that supportive intermediary services include performance of the criminal  			 background check on prospective attendants or include assistance to consumers  			 to enable them to perform this task. The study also recommends that states  			 develop global fees for a package of supportive services rather than purchasing  			 each service separately. </font></td>
</tr></table><h3>VII. Spectrum ISO</h3>
<p><b>A. Overview </b></p>
<p>One of the eleven study states operated a Spectrum ISO (i.e.,  		Pennsylvania's Attendant Care Program). This ISO in effect combines all of the  		different services offered by the various ISO models discussed above under one  		umbrella CD-PAS and ISO program. Once a consumer is determined to be eligible  		for CD-PAS, the consumer can choose freely among the ISO service options. A  		small number of consumers participate in the "cash" option. However, the state  		was not "promoting" this option. The remainder of the approximately 2,000  		consumers participating in the Pennsylvania Attendant Care Program were  		directed to the Combination (Fiscal ISO) and Agency (Agency with Choice ISO)  		options due to the state's concerns over the legal status of attendants and the  		concern that appropriate compliance with regulatory requirements were not being  		met. A goal of the Attendant Care Program is to make consumers "blind" to  		program funding sources so that the funding sources and eligibility process  		create a "seamless" PAS delivery system where consumers can be afforded the  		level of consumer-direction they desire. One consumer interviewed reported that  		"during the week I have to get to work on time so I use the attendant I  		recruited and use the Fiscal ISO option (combination). However, on weekends and  		holidays it is more difficult to access PAS attendants and my schedule is more  		flexible so I access attendants through the Agency with Choice ISO option."</p>
<p><b>B. Access, Consumer-Direction and Responsibility </b></p>
<p>The Spectrum ISO studied appeared to afford a very high level of access  		and consumer-direction to consumers with a varying consumer desire and ability.  		However, the Pennsylvania Attendant Care Program has sixteen Spectrum ISOs  		throughout the state, some of which subcontracted with other entities for  		fiscal and supportive intermediary services and agency-based PAS. This study  		found that in the case where the Spectrum ISO was not a CIL, consumers tended  		to rely heavily on agency-based PAS, accepting the personnel and services these  		agencies supplied. These consumers often were not fully aware of the options  		available to them and did not seem to know that they could assume a greater  		role in managing their own services. States that use multiple ISOs, no matter  		what type must be vigilant in monitoring these entities' commitment to and  		application of consumer-directed principles. </p>
<p><b>C. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></p>
<p>A Spectrum ISO may enhance program efficiency depending on the level of  		use of subcontracted services. Spectrum ISOs that manage the majority of the  		services under one umbrella organization (without the use of subcontracted  		services) must be capable of providing all of the intermediary service options  		and be well organized and capitalized in order to successfully offer the full  		range of services to consumers. </p>
<p>Whether or not the Spectrum ISO model is cost efficient depends on the  		negotiating abilities of the state CD-PAS program agency involved and the  		number of subcontractors used by the ISO. In the case of the Pennsylvania  		Attendant Care Program, Spectrum ISO fees varied from a maximum of ten percent  		of an agency's contract for programs funded through Act 150 funds to all  		inclusive hourly rates (including attendant wages) and a per month service fee  		for services funded with Medicaid waiver funds (See  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cdpasA1.htm#appendV.2">Appendix  		V.2</a>, Exhibit K). </p>
<p>The level of compliance and accountability achieved by a Spectrum ISO is  		high because the design of the program allows consumers to move within the  		intermediary service options. For example, consumers who are unsuccessful  		managing their services under the "cash" option can be moved to the fiscal  		agent or agency with choice option as needed. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Spectrum ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font> Use of the so-called "Spectrum"  			 ISO model permits a state to offer consumers a wide range of intermediary  			 service options using a single umbrella organization. Thus, a state maintains  			 control over the CD-PAS program and ISO design and philosophy, while at the  			 same time, offers consumers a broad range of intermediary services to assist  			 them in accessing and successfully participating in CD-PAS programs. This ISO  			 model can eliminate the need for and the costs associated with multiple CD-PAS  			 programs that use a variety of ISOs. It allows the state to develop a seamless  			 CD-PAS service delivery model. The Spectrum ISO also allows consumers to access  			 the intermediary services that meet their needs now and as their needs change.  			 Therefore, this report recommends that states consider implementing  			 Spectrum ISOs when designing CD-PAS programs. The keys to a successful Spectrum  			 ISO are: (1) good, testable performance standards in provider contracts, (2) a  			 strong commitment from vendor ISOs (and any subcontractors) to the principles  			 of consumer-direction and the Independent Living philosophy and (3) periodic  			 monitoring and evaluation of Spectrum ISOs and their subcontractors.  			 </font></td>
</tr></table><table><tr><td><font><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations that Are Applicable Across All ISO Model</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>There are a number of conclusions  			 and recommendations that are applicable to all ISO models. These include the  			 following. </font>
<ol><li><font>The most successful State-ISO contract  				  relationships are forged when the state has a clear understanding of the  				  services it wishes to purchase from an ISO. Therefore, state CD-PAS  				  program agencies should develop contracts with ISOs that clearly state an ISO's  				  role, responsibilities and services. These contracts should include performance  				  standards that can be used to assess an ISO's activities and its commitment to  				  consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living philosophy.</font></li>
<li><font>Consumers's back-up plans for relief attendants  				  frequently fail causing consumers to have a difficult time finding relief  				  attendants over weekends, holidays and when the primary attendant is absent for  				  any reason. Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop a  				  mechanism that facilitates consumers access to relief attendants, possibly  				  through an arrangement with a Agency with Choice ISO or a Spectrum ISO that  				  offers agency-based PAS.</font></li>
<li><font>Consumers are hesitant to initiate criminal  				  background checks on prospective attendants because they do not know how to  				  conduct them and they feel these checks adversely compromise the  				  consumer-attendant relationship. Therefore, state CD-PAS program  				  agencies should develop a standard, user friendly system, implemented either by  				  the state or an ISO, that either assists consumers in performing this task or  				  directly conducts criminal background checks on prospective attendants for  				  consumers.</font></li>
<li><font>The availability of supportive intermediary  				  services varies by ISO model. However, some level of supportive services is key  				  for consumers to successfully participate in a CD-PAS program.  				  Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should incorporate supportive  				  intermediary services into their CD-PAS program no matter what other ISO model  				  is used.</font></li>
<li><font>ISOs, and the agencies they subcontract with,  				  vary in their commitment to consumer-directed principles and the Independent  				  Living philosophy. Therefore, states should develop performance  				  standards in ISO contracts that address the ISO's and their subcontractors'  				  commitment to consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living  				  philosophy.</font></li>
<li><font>State nurse practice acts and their effect on  				  CD-PAS programs vary from state to state. Therefore, states should  				  pursue exemptions to their nurse practice acts if possible, or should seek to  				  develop protocols permitting delegation that are consistent with CD-PAS program  				  goals and the Independent Living philosophy.</font></li>
<li><font>A number of states have considered personal  				  care attendants to be independent contractors and some continue to consider  				  them as such even though regulatory authorities have determined them to be  				  someone's employee. Therefore, states should design programs with  				  mechanisms (including intermediary services) that assist consumers in complying  				  with the IRS rules for household employees and avoid referring to personal care  				  attendants as independent contractors.</font></li>
<li><font>A number of advocates and CD-PAS consumers  				  expressed concern about the potential impact of managed care on the  				  availability of CD-PAS to eligible consumers. Therefore, state Medicaid  				  managed care programs of the elderly and persons with disabilities should be  				  designed to include and accommodate this important service option.</font></li>

Moreover, while an employee  			 formerly needed to earn only $630 per quarter to earn a Social Security credit  			 when the $50 threshold was in place, the same employee receives no Social  			 Security credit until he or she has earned $1,000 or more annually from an  			 individual employer.</p>

<p><a name="note23" id="note23">IRS</a> Notice 95-18 states that the IRS would  			 waive penalties for late deposits for agents acting pursuant to Revenue  			 Procedure 80-4 (state employer agents) and would permit end of year depositing  			 and filing without penalty provided that all applicable taxes were deposited  			 "on or before the due date of the applicable return." The Notice was silent  			 with regard to waivers for fiscal agents not covered by Revenue Procedure 80-4,  			 but there is good reason to think that vendor agents under contract to state  			 agencies to act as ISOs for consumers in CD-PAS programs would be similarly  			 protected by this waiver.</p>

<p><a name="note27" id="note27">Even</a> though reported cases reflect this  			 interpretation of the law and find that the companionship exemption insulates  			 employers from the payment of overtime for this class of workers, some believe  			 that the law should be changed to clarify any ambiguities and effectively  			 eliminate this exemption so that personal care attendants would earn overtime.  			 Judge Pregerson, dissenting in the Oregon case of <i>McCune v. Oregon Senior  			 Services Division</i>, 894 F. 2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1990), cited by Sabatino and  			 Litvak in their 1995 paper, argued that the decision reached by the majority  			 (holding for the employer) was ill-advised. Judge Pregerson believed that the  			 term "companion" was not intended to include persons who provided medical care  			 or who did substantial household work, but rather only to those who were merely  			 there to "watch an older person." (894 F. 2d at 1111). This interpretation,  			 however, is not reflected in the plain language of the regulation. Moreover, it  			 is established that attendants do not provide "medical care."</p>

<p><a name="note36" id="note36">The</a> Medicaid program has solicited comment with  			 regard to a proposed rule which would explicitly eliminate the requirement for  			 nursing supervision of personal care services. Under the same proposal states  			 would be given flexibility to "determine, through development of provider  			 qualifications, which individuals are qualified to provide personal care  			 services." The proposed rule limits state flexibility to the extent that it  			 prevents spouses, parents and step-parents of minors from providing personal  			 care services. The proposed rule is silent on the question of whether some  			 personal care services fall within the definition of nursing as set forth in  			 state nurse practice acts. Proposed amendments to 42 CFR Part 440. Federal  			 Register, Vol. 61, Number 47, March 8, 1996. The final rule has not been  			 adopted yet, but it is believed that the final rule may include a provision  			 specifying that any conflict between program regulations and state definitions  			 of "nursing" or "nursing practice" is to be resolved with reference to  			 individual states' nurse practice acts.</p>
