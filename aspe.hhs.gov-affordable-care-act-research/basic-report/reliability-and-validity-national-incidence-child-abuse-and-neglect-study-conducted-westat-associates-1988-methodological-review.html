</dl><h2><a name="overview" id="overview">OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<p>In early 1989, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE), Department of Health and Human Services, entered into a  		contract with SysteMetrics and the National Committee for Prevention of Child  		Abuse (NCPCA) to conduct a methodological review of the Study of National  		Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS-2) completed by Westat  		Associates in 1986. That study examined the number of child abuse cases  		recognized by a range of social service, health care and law enforcement  		professionals in a random sample of counties throughout the United States. The  		methodology applied in this study paralleled a process undertaken by these same  		researchers in 1980, thereby making it possible to compare child abuse rates  		over time. A formal contract to conduct a review of the 1988 study and  		comparability of its eventual estimates to the figures generated in the 1980  		study was awarded by ASPE in March, 1989 to SysteMetrics and NCPCA.</p>
<p>The contract involved three major activities:</p>
<ul><li>a methodological review of the NIS-2 by two expert sampling  		  statisticians to determine the validity of the procedures undertaken by Westat  		  Associates and the reliability of the estimates made with respect to the  		  incidence of maltreatment;</li>
<li>informal discussions with several child abuse researchers and policy  		  makers to identify alternative hypotheses for the observed 66% increase in  		  maltreatment between 1980 and 1985; and</li>
<li>a secondary analysis of the NIS data to determine its utility to  		  address key policy and program issues.</li>
</ul><p>The purpose of this report is to summarize the findings generated by  		these three activities and to highlight the implications of these findings on  		further federally-funded national incidence studies.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">NATIONAL INCIDENCE STUDY BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>The Study of National Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse and  		Neglect (NIS-2) was commissioned by the National Center on Child Abuse and  		Neglect (NCCAN) in response to a specific Congressional mandate in the Child  		Abuse Amendments of 1984 (P.L. 98-257). The purpose of this study was to assess  		the current national incidence of child abuse and neglect and to determine how  		the severity, frequency, and character of child maltreatment changed since the  		completion of a similar study in 1980 (NIS-1).</p>
<p>Both the 1986 and 1980 study followed essentially the same design. Data  		were collected concerning cases of child maltreatment which were recognized and  		reported to the study by "community professionals" in a national probability  		sample of 29 counties throughout the United States. These professionals  		included the local Child Protective Services (CPS) staff in these counties as  		well as key respondents in a variety of other non-CPS settings such as schools,  		hospitals, police departments, juvenile probation authorities, day care  		centers, and mental health agencies. Participating professionals served as  		"sentinels" by remaining on the lookout during the study's three month data  		collection period for cases meeting the study's definitions of child  		maltreatment.</p>
<p>The most recent National Incidence Study employed two definitions of  		maltreatment. The more restrictive one, which parallels the definitions used in  		the 1980 study, counted only those cases in which a child had suffered  		observable harm as a result of abusive or neglectful behavior: Under the second  		set of definitions, countable cases also included those children who were  		endangered but not necessarily harmed, as a result of maltreatment. Under the  		first set of definitions, more than one million children, or 16.3 per 1,000 are  		estimated to be abused or neglected annually. Applying the second set of  		definitions, this number increases to 1.6 million, or 25.2 per 1,000.</p>
<p>The over one million estimated child abuse and neglect victims in the  		1986 study represent a 66% increase over the number identified in the 1980  		study. In reporting this finding, the Westat study team suggested that this  		increase was probably due more to an increase in the recognition of child  		maltreatment by community professionals than to any increase in the actual  		incidence. The research team based this conclusion on two observations: the  		emphasis in the 1980's on community awareness of the existence of abuse and  		neglect as well as the need to report suspected maltreatment, and the fact that  		the greatest increase was in moderate abuse and child sexual abuse, types of  		maltreatment particularly sensitive to this type of awareness building.</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">KEY FINDINGS AND SUGGESTED CHANGES FOR NIS-3</a></h2>
<p>This analysis identified a number of cautions to bear in mind when  		interpreting the NIS study findings or utilizing this data base to addressing  		critical policy and program concerns. As an incidence study, the consulting  		statisticians noted the following methodological concerns:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The inability of NIS-2 to specify the extent of duplication among  			 reported cases, particularly in the sample's large urban counties, introduced  			 an unquantified but potentially significant degree of upward bias into the  			 final estimates, especially in NIS-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The multiple sampling strategies employed at every level of the  			 NIS-2 (i.e. the selection of counties, selection of specific agencies,  			 selection of specific respondents within these agencies, and, in the largest  			 counties, the selection of only a sample of reported cases) further complicated  			 the ability to address the duplication issue and to generate reliable estimates  			 of the total scope of the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To arrive at national estimates from NIS-2 sampling, the study  			 applied multiple weights to each observation in accordance with the probability  			 of having selected the source who reported it to the study population (i.e. the  			 probability that other professionals working in similar agency settings would  			 identity a similar number of maltreatment cases). This procedure, while  			 necessary, can only be accomplished by making numerous assumptions that the  			 sampling was representative. As discussed below, the statisticians did not feel  			 the extent and direction of the bias introduced by these assumptions was  			 adequately quantified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study contains no specific information on the experience or  			 educational levels of the professionals participating in the study nor on the  			 policies with respect to reporting or staff training operating at the agency  			 level, making it impossible to address in any empirical sense the relationship  			 between professional education or awareness and recognition of  			 maltreatment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Both reviewers suggested that a very rigorous methodological review be  		conducted prior to authorizing another national incidence study. It is  		suggested that an in-depth review by a panel of experts be conducted to  		determine the most appropriate methods for conducting a national incidence  		study on such a complex problem as child maltreatment. The panel should  		consider:</p>
<ul><li>expanding the types of sentinels utilized in the study to capture a  		  more complete pool of key professionals who have frequent contact with children  		  of all ages, such as pediatricians, public health nurses, youth workers, and  		  mental health professionals;</li>
<li>incorporating non-professional respondents into the sampling  		  frame;</li>
<li>altering the sample selection process so agencies would be sampled in  		  direct relation to the size of the county in which they are located;</li>
<li>altering the data collection period.</li>
</ul><p>To assist in the development of NIS-3 it is also recommended that an  		in-depth review in a limited number of counties be conducted to determine in  		these few counties the:</p>
<ul><li>universe of all potential respondent agencies;</li>
<li>magnitude of duplication rates;</li>
<li>level of trained and independent knowledge regarding child abuse and  		  neglect reporting requirements and the indicators of maltreatment;</li>
<li>specific agency-level policies regarding maltreatment reporting,  		  staff training, and reporting responsibilities;</li>
<li>impacts of state and county policies on the reporting practices of  		  local professionals.</li>
</ul><p>It should be noted, however, that the introduction of any of these  		changes into subsequent NIS research designs will influence the extent to which  		one can make direct comparisons with the incidence levels identified in NIS 1  		and 2.</p>
<p>Over and above these concerns, lies the broader question of the NIS-2's  		ability to address emerging policy and program concerns facing the child  		welfare system. There may well exist an inherent dilemma in trying to address  		policy questions with a data base developed to look at incidence. For example,  		it may be useful to shift the emphasis from incidence to incorporate the  		different aspects of the dynamic processes of CPS agencies which directly  		affect whether a case is reported or not. As structured, the data base does  		offer an opportunity to explore the unique characteristics of maltreatment  		within specific subpopulations. As a sample of over 5,000 child abuse and  		neglect cases, the data base provides rich information on the types of cases  		professionals in different settings are observing and the descriptive  		characteristics of various types of maltreatment. Because of the complex  		weighting system utilized and the observed differences in the types of cases  		found in large, medium and small counties, however, the data base is less  		useful for determining national practice and average performance. Specific  		changes which would increase the utility of the incidence data to address  		policy questions include:</p>
<ul><li>collecting more specific data on an agency's policy with respect to  		  observed cases of maltreatment. For example, many schools require teachers to  		  report suspected cases to the principal or school counselor rather than  		  directly to CPS;</li>
<li>collecting more information about a professional's level of training  		  and their perceptions regarding the adequacy of this training;</li>
<li>collecting information which reflects what actually happens to a case  		  once it is reported, including how long it takes to go through the system,  		  which agencies become involved, etc,;</li>
<li>lengthening the data collection time period to avoid the need for  		  annualized weights;</li>
<li>collecting explicit information from the sentinels regarding the  		  action they took in response to a suspected child maltreatment incident (e.g.,  		  did they report the case?).</li>
</ul><p>Finally, the extent of secondary analysis of any data base is highly  		correlated to the time it takes to understand the data structure. There were  		several problems with the NIS-2 data as it was released. First, there are  		several types of missing data which are not delineated in the code book. For at  		least six variables, there are values in the raw data which are not coded or  		represented in the codebook. These variables are: mother's employment (162  		cases), father's employment (1477 cases), child's sex (11 cases), family income  		(142 cases), AFDC (56 cases) father's age (1614 cases) and mother's age (310).  		Using SPSS-X, the values appear as "system missing". These values could be  		either missing or not applicable. Preliminary analysis suggested that the  		majority of these were, in fact, not applicables, but there was not enough  		information to be certain. For at least 15 other variables, there are values  		which are coded as blank yet are not adequately explained in the codebook.  		Further, variables not on a specific form were given the code of "X". These  		variables needed to be converted to alphanumeric before they could be analyzed  		in SPSS-X.</p>
<p>Second, the use of different data collection forms, such as the non-CPS,  		the CPS short form and the CPS long form, further complicated the analyses. The  		forms did not collect the information in the same manner and they used two  		different referent points. The non-CPS form bases its questions on the child.  		The CPS form bases its questions on the adults. Consequently, there is not a  		direct measure on some very crucial variables. For example, with regard to the  		child's ethnicity, the non-CPS form collected the ethnicity of the child; the  		CPS long-form did not ask for the child's ethnicity but asked for the  		mother/substitute ethnicity. The same is true for household structure. The  		non-CPS form asked about the relationship of the adults to the child, while the  		CPS form records information about whether the mother/substitute or  		father/substitute is in the home. To obtain information on child's ethnicity  		and household structure for the entire sample, one has to use a combination of  		variables on the two different forms. These measures are indirect.</p>
<p>Third, some of the evaluative coding was not clearly justified. For  		example, in Westat's computed variables for type of abuse, it is not clear why  		cases which were out of scope with respect to time but were on CPS long forms  		were included in the countable definition. It leads one to suspect that CPS  		forms were given more credibility than the non-CPS forms. A number of decisions  		were made and the data went through a number of transformations before it  		actually made it to the tape. In a few instances, especially with regard to the  		perpetrator variables, it appeared that even though the information was  		collected on both forms, not all the information was included on the data  		tape.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of the sampling weights severely limits the use of the  		NIS-2 as a public use data set. The primary shortcoming is that, according to  		Westat, a special software package is needed for any multivariate analysis to  		obtain the correct standard errors. Unlike the standard social science software  		packages, the special ones are likely to be difficult to obtain and use without  		comprehensive documentation. As a result, many analysts will shy away from  		using the data. Moreover, while it is clear that the weights are necessary to  		determine incidence, it is unclear that the use of the sampling weights is  		necessary in others cases. It depends on the question to be answered and the  		way the model is specified. Statistically, if the weights are a function of the  		independent variables in the model, then using the unweighted estimates yield  		consistent estimates of the true regression slope. However, in situations where  		the weights are a function of the dependent variable, then it is best to use  		the weights to obtain consistent estimates.<sup><font><a href="../node/66106.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Thus, if one is interested in predicting the  		demographic determinants of abuse, using the weights is not necessary because  		the types of abuse are not related to the sampling design. In addition, while  		many national data sets include sampling weights related to their sampling  		design (e.g., the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth over sampled minorities  		and disadvantaged whites), most analysts do not use them. Rather, the analysts  		focus on specifying the correct functional form of their models, a process  		which precludes the need for sampling weights.</p>
<p>The following suggestions would make the NIS-2 data a more appealing  		public use data set:</p>
<ul><li>define all values for all variables using numeric characters  		  including a code for missing, valid skips, invalid skips etc.;</li>
<li>include all raw data on the data tape in addition to the cleaned or  		  created variables;</li>
<li>collect all the data on the same data collection instrument; and</li>
<li>include more documentation in the codebook to give rationale for  		  recoding variables a specific way.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="method" id="method">SPECIFIC METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS</a></h2>
<p>Shortly following the contract award, NCPCA established formal contracts  		with Dr. Tom Marx, an independent sampling statistician and Dr. Martin Frankel,  		director of sampling for the National Opinion Research Corporation, University  		of Chicago to conduct formal reviews of Westat's procedures. The full written  		reports submitted by the statisticians are found in <a href="../node/66106.html#appendA">Appendix  		A</a>. The, purpose of this section is to briefly summarize these comments as  		they relate to the points outlined above and to incorporate, where appropriate,  		clarifications made by the Westat team regarding the procedures they  		followed.</p>
<h3>Case Duplication</h3>
<p>Of particular concern to the statistical review team was the question of  		duplication found among the reported cases both between CPS and non-CPS  		agencies as well as within a CPS agency. As one might imagine, an abused or  		neglected child might well be identified by a number of professionals over a  		given period of time. An obvious source of this type of duplication would be a  		child reported to CPS during the Westat study period by a hospital social  		worker. Both the social worker and the CPS caseworker would have completed case  		forms on the child, thereby potentially generated two "incidence" of  		maltreatment when in fact there was only one. In addition, a child might have  		been reported to CPS two or more times during the study period. Because the  		incidence study is designed to estimate the number of Children abused or  		neglected in a given year rather than the annual number of maltreatment  		episodes, correcting for this type of "within CPS" duplication is critical.</p>
<p>The Westat study team devoted a good deal of time identifying both types  		of "duplicate" cases and insuring that the national incidence estimates were  		based only an "unduplicated" reports. In all counties, duplicate reports were  		identified and resolved in a uniform manner so that each child was reported on  		only one data form. Even in the large counties, where sampling was heaviest,  		Westat unduplicated all children who were reported on more than one data form,  		whether they were duplicated on more than one CPS form, on more than one  		non-CPS form or had been reported on both a non-CPS and a CPS data form.  		However, a number of logistical barriers precluded the absolute identification  		of all duplicate cases, particularly in the larger counties. These barriers  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The sampling of CPS cases within large counties. This strategy meant  			 that in several counties only a small fraction of the reported cases (less than  			 5%) were entered into the NIS-2 data base. Consequently, it is not known  			 whether a case might have emerged as a duplicate report had the study included  			 a more representative sample of all reported CPS cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sampling of non-CPS agencies within counties which did not cover  			 similar geographic regions within the county. The Westat study team assumed  			 that the duplication issue was of greater magnitude between CPS and non-CPS  			 agencies than among non-CPS agencies. While this assumption might well be  			 valid, studies conducted on child abuse fatality cases suggest that local  			 hospital, school district and community-based agency personnel are often all  			 involved with chronic abusive or neglectful families. The National Incidence  			 Study offered no systematic way to test the duplication across non-CPS agencies  			 because the relatively small sample of agencies included in the study were  			 rarely located in similar geographic areas. The sample school districts rarely  			 served the same neighborhoods as the sample hospitals, sample day care centers,  			 sample mental health centers, or sample police departments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data collection period. In general, the longer the observation  			 period, the higher the likelihood for duplication either within or across  			 agencies. For example, a recent longitudinal study on the reincidence rates in  			 one Indiana county conducted by Dean Knudsen at Purdue University found that  			 almost one-quarter of all cases reported to CPS in a given calendar year  			 involve children already reported at least once in that year. If the  			 observation period is extended to include both the present and prior calendar  			 year, this percentage increases to over 40%.<sup><font><a href="../node/66106.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>In essence, these conditions resulted in an inability to determine the  		exact extent of the "between CPS and non-CPS agencies" duplication in the large  		counties; the "within CPS" duplication in the large counties; and the "among  		non-CPS agencies' duplication that does not also overlap with CPS in counties  		where non-CPS agencies were sampled in more than one category (i.e. the medium  		and large counties). Westat addressed the first of these issues through  		weighting procedures. Specifically, whenever a child had been reported to CPS  		by a source that was also participating in the NIS study, the case was assigned  		a case rate of "1" in the total county estimates (i.e. it was not weighted up  		to represent anything other than itself). This strategy assumes that any CPS  		case which could have been reported to the study by a non-CPS participant  		actually was reported and would have been identified as such had the NIS study  		sample included all CPS cases. With respect to the second issue, Westat did  		consider the potential for repeated reports in annualizing the three-month  		data. The annualization factors utilized in this study were based on NIS-1  		information and inherently entail some assumptions about the likelihood of  		repeat reports. No additional attempts were made to compensate for multiple  		reports on the same child to CPS in a given year nor to address the issue of  		"among non-CPS agencies" duplication. Both of these issues, however, were  		considered by Westat to involve only trival rates of duplication and,  		therefore, to have only marginal impacts on the final estimates.</p>
<p>These strategies aside, the consultants concluded that the study team's  		estimates based upon the sample drawn did suffer from an upward bias, noting  		that the magnitude of the bias is virtually impossible to define. For example,  		the application of the NIS-1 annualization figures, while potentially the only  		estimate of repeat reports available, might well be an underestimate of the  		problem. If one assumes higher recognition rates among professionals, as the  		Westat study team did in explaining the observed increase in maltreatment  		between 1980 and 1986, one also might assume increases in the chances of an  		abused child being reported repeatedly. By applying the 1980 annualization  		figure, the Westat study team might have underestimated the rate of duplication  		and therefore overestimated the actual incidence rate. Similarly, the more  		intensive sampling in the NIS-2 study, particularly in the large counties,  		compounded the ability of the study to identify duplications "among non-CPS  		agencies" at a time of increased education and awareness of child abuse in  		several professions. As summarized by Dr. Frankel: "The problem with the  		approach used is that no attempt has been made to quantify the magnitude of the  		bias. We are certain that the procedure is biased, but we do not know the size  		of the bias (statistical bias). We cannot assume that the impact of the bias is  		small."</p>
<p>In response to this conclusion, the Westat study team decided to further  		examine their assumption that the undetected duplication was trivial.  		Specifically, the study team analyzed the full set of countable data forms in  		both the NIS-1 and NIS-2 to see what the national estimates would be if no  		unduplication had been performed in either study and to examine the degree to  		which the duplicated estimates were reduced in each study. As summarized in  		<a href="../node/66106.html#table1">Table 1</a>, the procedures used for unduplication in NIS-1  		reduced the total number of maltreated children to 625,063, or 61% of the  		duplicated total. The NIS-2 procedures reduced the countable cases to  		1,025,168, or 66% of the duplicate total. The Westat research team concluded  		that given the comparability between the two rates, the upward bias introduced  		into the 1988 study due to a failure to unduplicate all reports was minimal. If  		the duplicated 1988 totals were reduced by only the 61% rate observed in 1980,  		the final estimated number of abuse and neglect cases would have been 949,375,  		only 7% lower than the figure obtained.</p>
<p>This analysis suggest that the issue of duplication, while a serious  		theoretical concern, might have had limited practical implications on the  		established national estimates. However, this conclusion is based upon the  		assumption that minimal changes occurred in the frequency of duplicated reports  		between NIS-1 and NIS-2. As noted above, this assumption can be questioned  		given the increased awareness of maltreatment and the professional training  		which occurred during the 1980's. Further, the slightly higher duplication rate  		noted in the NIS-2 was achieved with more heavily sampled data, leading one to  		assume that the difference would have been more pronounced with more  		comprehensive samples in the larger counties. While it is highly improbable  		that the failure to account for all duplication explains the increase noted in  		child abuse and neglect incidence rates between NIS-1 and NIS-2, this issues  		remains a critical one for future incidence studies.</p>
<h3>Appropriateness of the NIS-2 Sample Counties</h3>
<p>Both statisticians indicated that the 29 counties included in the  		National Incidence Study represent both an accurate and representative sample  		of U.S. counties. While one of the reviewers suggested that the sample counties  		might be examined for the extent to which they represent other characteristics  		related to maltreatment (e.g. income distribution, racial composition, etc.),  		both agreed that the sample was representative along the key dimensions of  		interest, namely geographic location and population density.</p>

<p>As outlined earlier, professionals working in a wide range of community  		based agencies were utilized in the NIS-2 as "sentinels" to identify cases of  		maltreatment during the study period. Both of the reviewers expressed  		reservations regarding the extent to which the non-CPS agencies included in the  		sample were representative of the potential universe of such agencies in each  		county. Particular concern regarding this issue was noted in the case of day  		care providers, mental health agencies and social service agencies, where the  		total universe of providers was virtually impossible to confirm.. While failing  		to quantify the universe of potential contributors to a given sample rarely  		impedes social science research, such knowledge' is more desirable when using a  		sample to quantify incidence levels than when using a sample to address more  		descriptive questions such as normative professional practices. The sampling  		procedures that Westat followed were generally well documented. However, both  		reviewers cited limitations with the methods used, limitations which might have  		notable impacts on how one weights the identified cases. This issue is of  		particular concern in the large counties where a much smaller percentage of the  		identified universe of agencies were generally selected. For example, the study  		allowed for a maximum sampling frame of ten schools, 4.5 day care centers, five  		hospitals, and four mental health agencies regardless of county size. Given the  		wide variation in child abuse awareness and service levels found among the  		hospitals, school districts, and community-based agencies within the largest  		counties in the sample, surveying less than 5% of the total universe of  		respondents runs the risk of drawing a pool of respondents unrepresentative of  		the professional groups being tapped.</p>
<h3>Appropriateness of Sample Sentinels</h3>
<p>The reviewers expressed similar concerns with respect to the selection  		of specific respondents within a given agency. For example, social workers were  		used as the respondents in hospitals rather than emergency room personnel.  		While it is true that social workers are most likely to be aware of most child  		abuse cases identified at a hospital, they generally become involved only after  		other hospital personnel have made the decision to report a case. Given this  		pattern it is, perhaps, not surprising that the formal reporting rate among  		cases identified by hospital personnel was among the highest of all  		professional groups included in the sample (i.e. 66%). By the time a case has  		come to the attention of a hospital social worker, at least one other  		professional, be it a nurse or physician, has made the decision to take some  		action on a given case. The potential bias in this selection of key informants  		is that the study provides virtually no estimate of the number of cases  		emergency room staff or other medical personnel observe but fail to report to  		hospital social workers. Given the behavior identified by other professional  		groups in the Westat sample, one might assume that this downward bias is rather  		significant. For example, classroom teachers were used as the only key  		informants in day care centers and as one of four respondent categories in  		local school districts. As reported by Westat, these "front line" workers were  		considerably less likely to formally report an identified case than hospital  		social workers. Only 16% of the cases identified by day care providers and 24%  		of the cases identified by school personnel were formally reported.</p>
<h3>Appropriateness of the Case Weights Utilized</h3>
<p>The National Incidence Study employed a complex, multi-level system of  		weights in estimating the incidence of abuse and neglect. Each countable case  		or case which met the study's definition of maltreatment was weighted with  		respect to a number of properties. A final case weight, derived from the  		individual weights, was generated to estimate the number of cases with these  		given properties one might expect to see if a national census of all children  		were taken. In other words, the national incidence estimates are based on a  		weighted average of a sample of cases known to a sample of professionals  		working in a sample of counties. Both of the reviewers raised serious concerns  		that this multiple weighing procedure adequately compensated for the inherent  		bias recognized in the many assumptions that were made in generating the  		sample.</p>
<h3>Appropriateness of NIS-2 Sample Period</h3>
<p>One of the reviewers questioned the appropriateness of the abbreviated  		data collection period utilized in NIS-2. Unlike NIS-1 which collected data for  		a full year, the NIS-2 data collection period covered three months for most  		sentinels and ten weeks for school personnel. In projecting annual incidence  		rates based upon this shortened data collection period, the Westat study team  		used the pace of reporting documented in the NIS-1. This procedure introduces  		an additional assumption into the study design.</p>
<h3>Appropriateness of Weight Trimming</h3>
<p>Similarly, the use of weight trimming at the final stages of the  		analysis may also have altered the national incidence estimates. Under this  		procedure, the study team trimmed back the total case weights to 2,000 (before  		annualization) in those instances where the value exceeded 2,000. While this  		process is well within the range of acceptable statistical adjustments, the  		process does introduce a downward bias in the final estimates. Given that the  		average weight applied to cases in this study was 158.3 (before annualization),  		those cases with "trimmed" weights had a substantial impact on the study's  		final estimates. However, only 21 cases were "trimmed" in this manner.</p>
<h2><a name="analytic" id="analytic">SPECIFIC ANALYTIC CONCERNS</a></h2>
<p>In order to explore the utility of the NIS-2 data base in addressing  		policy and program concerns, a series of analyses were conducted on three  		principal questions:</p>
<ul><li>the factors which influence the degree to which CPS is aware of child  		  maltreatment cases recognized by professionals;</li>
<li>the factors which influence CPS determining if a given report is a  		  founded, indicated or unfounded case of maltreatment; and</li>
<li>the factors which distinguish different child abuse and neglect  		  subpopulations.</li>
</ul><p>This section of the report summarizes the findings from these analyses  		and highlights the ways in which the study methodology as opposed to the actual  		reality of the situation might have influenced the results. Unless otherwise  		noted, all percentages included in the following tables reflect the  		distributions for the weighted data.</p>
<h3>CPS Awareness Levels</h3>
<p>One of the most frequently cited findings from both of the NIS studies  		is the relatively small percentage of cases known to professionals which were  		actually investigated by child protective service agencies. Overall, Westat  		reported that only 46% of the cases identified in the present study were known  		to and investigated by local child protective service agencies. This figure is  		comparable to the rate of reporting noted in the initial national incidence  		study (NIS-1). In that study, only 33% of the cases identified by professionals  		had been formally reported.</p>
<p>In defense of professionals not reporting all known cases, many  		practitioners feel they can better protect the child by not reporting known or  		suspected cases. These workers cite the inflexibility in certain child  		protective service procedures and the poor follow-through during the  		investigative and treatment planning process as resulting in increased client  		frustration, anger at the system, and a sense of personal betrayal by the  		professional from whom they had originally sought assistance (Alfaro, 1984).  		More recent research suggest that such reasons, while continuing to be cited,  		may not be the primary reasons for not reporting. Zellman (1990) found in her  		survey of 912 professionals that the most frequently endorsed reason for  		failing to report was a lack of sufficient evidence that abuse or neglect had  		occurred. Also important was the fact that the observed act was not serious  		enough to report, that they suspected the abuse had already been reported by  		another source, and that the situation had resolved itself.</p>
<p>In addition to concern over the significant number of cases not being  		reported to protective services, it has long been suspected that professionals  		are influenced by a client's race, income or marital status in determining when  		to report. In a secondary analysis of the NIS-1 data, Newberger (1983) found  		that a disproportionate number of unreported cases were victims of emotional  		abuse, in families of higher income, whose mothers were alleged to be  		responsible for the injuries and who were white. The severity of harm resulting  		from the maltreatment was found to be a significant discriminating factor  		between reported and unreported cases only when income level was excluded from  		the analyses, suggesting that class and race, not severity, define who does and  		who does not get reported.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the potential reasons behind the significant  		number of cases known to professionals but not known or investigated by CPS  		observed in the NIS-2 data, NCPCA conducted a number of crosstabulations  		between this variable and certain demographic characteristics identified by  		ASPE.<sup><font><a href="../node/66106.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> These  		characteristics included:</p>
<ul><li>child's age;</li>
<li>child's sex;</li>
<li>child's race;</li>
<li>age of mother;</li>
<li>employment status of mother;</li>
<li>household income;</li>
<li>household AFDC status;</li>
<li>family composition;</li>
<li>number of children in the family;</li>
<li>type of abuse; and</li>
<li>county size in which the incident occurred.</li>
</ul><p>The results of these crosstabulations are presented in <a href="../node/66106.html#table2">Table 2</a>. As this table indicates, the proportion of  		countable cases included in this analysis which were known to and investigated  		by CPS is 42.5%, slightly less than the number reported by Westat.<sup><font><a href="../node/66106.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to the Newberger finding, race and income do not distinguish  		between cases known to CPS and cases known only to professionals. While  		two-parent families were slightly less likely to be known to CPS than single  		parent families (39% versus 42%), the overall pattern in the crosstabulations  		does not suggest extensive screening by professionals based on questions of  		race, income or family composition. The one variable which might suggest a  		particular bias on the part of CPS or professionals is the high proportion of  		mothers not in the labor force who were known to CPS and the very low  		proportion of mothers looking for work not known to CPS. This pattern may  		suggest a tendency among professionals to have greater faith in the parenting  		abilities of mothers actively seeking employment. On the other hand, this  		variable may be highly correlated with a number of other factors, such as the  		child's age, which influence CPS behavior. For example, if mothers not in the  		labor force are more likely to have younger children, the observed pattern  		might well reflect the tendency of CPS to be more aware of younger children  		rather than any overt opinions of parenting capabilities influenced by maternal  		employment status.</p>

</tr></table><p>Demographic factors found to influence whether or not a case is reported  		and investigated by CPS include the victim's age, maternal age, number of  		children in a family, and type of abuse. Not surprisingly, child protective  		services are more likely to be aware of maltreatment involving younger children  		than teenagers, a pattern indicative of the greater importance placed on  		protecting young infants, toddlers and early school-aged children. The very  		high percentage of children 3 to 5 known to CPS (60%) was somewhat surprising.  		This pattern might have been generated by the high percentage of this age group  		which were involved in physical abuse and child sexual abuse. Given the fact  		that younger children were more likely to be known to CPS than older children,  		it was not surprising to find younger mothers more likely known to CPS than  		older mothers.</p>
<p>As anticipated, public investigative energies tend to focus on  		maltreatment forms which produce more solid physical evidence of harm to the  		child. As a result, a lower proportion of educational neglect, emotional  		maltreatment and sexual abuse cases are reported to and investigated by CPS.  		While a professional may suspect a child is being mistreated in these manners,  		proving these suspicions, particularly in the absence of a formal disclosure by  		the victim or admission of guilt by a perpetrator, can be extremely  		problematic. Further, many child protective service agencies are faced with the  		need to prioritize because existing resources are insufficient to allow for a  		thorough investigation of all reports (Wells, Fluke, Downing and Brown, 1989).  		As a result, first priority is given to those types of maltreatment perceived  		as most severe and offering the clearest grounds for further judicial  		action.</p>
<p>As reported in <a href="../node/66106.html#table2">Table 2</a>, levels of CPS awareness  		differed rather notably for counties of different size. CPS is less likely to  		be aware of cases in large SMSAs and more likely to be aware of cases in rural  		areas than those in medium size SMSAs. Again, this pattern is not surprising  		and may well reflect the difficulty CPS workers in the most urban counties face  		in balancing increased reports with stable or decreasing revenues. Because of  		the structure of the NIS data, it is not possible to determine if the absence  		of a case on the CPS listing is a function of the professional choosing not to  		report the case or CPS choosing not to investigate the case. In any event, it  		is consistent with current studies of CPS practice to conclude that the factors  		which would increase the likelihood of a CPS worker not reporting a case (e.g.  		feeling they can handle the case better without reporting, uncertainty over how  		CPS will respond) and factors which would result in more rigorous screening of  		reports prior to investigation may be more acute in urban communities.</p>
<p>For many of the variables included on <a href="../node/66106.html#table2">Table 2</a>,  		notable differences in the likelihood of CPS awareness of a case were found  		among the missing data categories. This pattern underscores the difficulty in  		using the NIS data to interpret questions of policy. If the data base was  		complete, the patterns observed above might not have been supported. While a  		certain degree of missing data is inevitable in any research project, variables  		with missing data on a quarter or more of the cases or individual cases which  		cannot be fully documented pose significant difficulties in drawing reliable  		policy and practice conclusions.</p>
<h3>Case Verification By CPS</h3>
<p>A frequently debated issue in the field is the acceptable level of  		unfounded cases. Because no child abuse reporting system in the country  		requires that professionals or individuals be absolutely certain abuse or  		neglect has occurred before filing a formal report, it is expected that some  		percentage of these reports will be found, following an investigation, not to  		involve abuse or neglect. In certain jurisdictions, the substantiation rate has  		dropped dramatically in recent years promoting some to argue that child  		protective services are being asked to function as an all purpose social  		service agency rather than as a specialized' unit dealing only with abuse and  		neglect (Besharov, 1986).</p>
<p>While individual jurisdictions have experienced significant variation in  		the percentage of substantiated cases, the national substantiation rate for  		child abuse reports has been remarkably consistent over the past ten years,  		hovering around 50% (AAPC, 1988). Further, the term unsubstantiated does not  		always imply the absence of maltreatment. As Finkelhor (1990) has argued, cases  		may be termed unsubstantiated for such diverse reasons as an investigation  		never occurred, the case is currently an active CPS case, or CPS had no  		services to offer the family. Even if the substantiation rate is as poor as  		some argue (i.e. 30%), this percentage would still compare favorably with the  		confirmation rate experienced by other emergency response systems. For example  		only about one-third of all calls to fire departments involve an actual fire  		and reviews of police time studies suggest beat patrol officers spend less than  		25% of their time dealing with violent crimes (Daro, 1988).</p>
<p>Very little empirical work has been done across jurisdictions regarding  		the characteristics of cases more or less likely to be substantiated. Barriers  		to this type of research include the different criteria used across states to  		determine whether a report does or does not constitute maltreatment and the  		practice in many jurisdictions of purging, all information on a case once it  		has been classified as unfounded or unsubstantiated. While the NIS-2 data is  		also hampered by the different standards for substantiation employed among the  		sample CPS agencies, the data do offer a unique opportunity to analyze these  		decisions in light of certain descriptive characteristics.</p>
<p>To identify characteristics associated with whether or not CPS  		substantiates a case, NCPCA conducted crosstabulations of whether a case was  		substantiated or unfounded by all but one of the descriptive characteristics  		used to examine CPS awareness. This analysis did not explore the relationship  		between case verification and type of abuse due to the specific sample utilized  		for the dependent variable. This analysis is based on <b>all</b> cases reported  		to CPS. Thus this sample differs from the sample used to investigate CPS  		awareness because it includes cases which the Westat study team deemed not  		countable. Because the non-countable cases were not assigned a maltreatment  		type in Westat's final structuring of the data, this variable is omitted from  		the present analysis.</p>
<p>As the results in <a href="../node/66106.html#table3">Table 3</a> show, CPS founded or  		indicated 54% of the cases. These two categories were combined for purposes of  		this analysis because a county level examination of the data found that several  		of the counties exclusively used either the "founded" or the "indicated"  		category. This suggest that local CPS policy rather than any objective  		interpretation of these terms governed how respondents classified the cases  		they were documenting.</p>
<p>As noted in the previous analysis, race and income factors do not appear  		to play a significant role in determining whether a case will be substantiated.  		Only marginal differences were noted in the proportion of lower income and AFDC  		recipients with substantiated reports as compared to the proportion  		substantiated for those with annual incomes over $15,000 and not receiving  		public assistance. The one economic variable which did seem to distinguish  		between substantiated and unsubstantiated cases was maternal employment.  		Mothers who were employed part-time or who considered themselves not in the  		labor force were more likely to be substantiated cases than were mothers who  		worked full-time.</p>
<p>Somewhat counterintuitive was the finding that two parent households  		were more likely than single parent households to involve substantiated  		maltreatment and that reports involving older children were more likely to be  		substantiated than ones involving younger children. Given the findings of the  		previous analysis and the characteristics typically ascribed to CPS caseloads,  		one might have anticipated higher substantiation rates for reports involving  		single parent families and infants. One interpretation of these findings is  		that screening along these dimensions might indeed take place prior to the  		decision to file a formal report. Professionals or individuals may require a  		higher standard of proof before formally reporting a case involving two parents  		or older children. As a result, cases with these characteristics which do find  		their way to protective services may include a higher than average percentage  		of more serious or more provable acts of maltreatment.</p>

</tr></table><p>Similarly, the importance of county size in determining whether a case  		is substantiated also illustrates an interesting counterpoint to the previous  		analysis. While cases identified in the largest counties were least likely to  		have been noted among CPS caseloads, the largest counties demonstrated the  		highest substantiation rate. In contrast, the rural counties which had  		demonstrated the highest CPS recognition rate, recorded the lowest  		substantiation rate. One interpretation of this pattern is that professionals  		in the largest counties both within and outside CPS do more rigorous screening  		of cases, reporting only the most serious or best documented maltreatment  		incidents. In smaller counties, professionals may be more willing to report and  		CPS more willing to investigate a wider range of maltreatment charges. As a  		result, fewer of these cases are substantiated or accepted for service. Again,  		the absence of any specific information on agency policies within the NIS-2  		data base precludes further empirical exploration of this issue.</p>
<h3>Subpopulation of Maltreatment</h3>
<p>The third analytical question NCPCA examined was what demographic  		characteristics distinguish different types of maltreatment. Child  		maltreatment, as a summative term, incorporates a wide range of behaviors.  		Parents who beat their children, the father who sexually molests his daughter,  		and the single parent who fails to ensure that her children attend school or  		receive adequate medical care are guilty, in the eyes of the law, of the same  		infraction --- child maltreatment. From a public policy perspective, child  		maltreatment is the generic problem comprising a variety of different, but  		theoretically similar, behaviors. Mistreatment of children or the failure to  		care for children is the central legal and policy issue; precisely how parents  		or caretakers choose to mistreat their children is of secondary concern. For  		purposes of clinical practice, however, quite the reverse is true.</p>
<p>As more is known about the diversity within the maltreatment population,  		unique subpopulations are being singled out for specific programmatic or  		legislative attention (Daro, 1988). Four major types of maltreatment are  		consistently cited in the literature -- physical abuse, physical neglect,  		emotional maltreatment and sexual abuse. In distinguishing among these four  		types, researchers have drawn on such diverse variables as the characteristics  		of the perpetrator, the characteristics of the victim, and the underlying  		personal and environmental factors which led to the maltreatment.</p>
<p>The NIS-2 offers a limited opportunity to explore demographic  		differences among families experiencing different types maltreatment. For  		purposes of this analysis, acts of maltreatment are divided into six  		categories: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, physical  		neglect, educational neglect, and other maltreatment. The NCPCA categorization  		system differs from the one employed by Westat in two ways. First, it includes  		only the first form of abuse, rather than all three forms combined. This  		provides a more straightforward description of the children involved. In our  		classification the case would be assigned whatever type was listed by the study  		source as the first type of abuse. Second, the types of abuse are collapsed  		into different categories. For example, we combined emotional abuse and neglect  		into emotional maltreatment. Other maltreatment includes general abuse, general  		neglect and other maltreatment.</p>
<p>NCPCA crosstabulated the types of abuse by the demographic  		characteristics used in the two previous analyses. These results are presented  		in <a href="../node/66106.html#table4">Table 4</a>. The most frequent form of maltreatment was  		physical neglect (32% of the sample), followed by physical abuse (21% of the  		sample), educational neglect (17% of the sample), emotional maltreatment (16%  		of the sample), sexual abuse (8% of the sample), and other maltreatment (7%  		of-the sample). This distribution pattern is slightly different from the  		distribution suggested by studies of reported cases of maltreatment. In 1986,  		almost 55% of all reports involved child neglect, 38% involved physical abuse,  		16% involved sexual abuse, 8% involved emotional maltreatment, and 8% involved  		other, unspecified types of maltreatment (AAPC, 1988). The higher proportion of  		sexual abuse cases and the lower proportion of emotional maltreatment in the  		two samples most likely reflect the differences in professional practice.  		Professionals may well be more likely to observe, but not report, incidences of  		emotional maltreatment and less likely to observe but more likely to report  		cases of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>As expected, the NIS-2 data support the notion of unique subpopulations  		of maltreatment. On most of the dimensions tested, the characteristics of the  		victims and their families differed depending upon the first type of  		maltreatment indicated for the case. Emotional maltreatment and educational  		neglect were more common among children 10 years of age or older than under 10.  		In contrast, young children were far more likely to be victims of child  		neglect. As would be expected, maternal age followed this same distribution,  		with younger moms more likely being noted in cases involving physical neglect  		and older moms being noted in cases involving emotional maltreatment and  		educational neglect.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most surprising distributions noted in  		<a href="../node/66106.html#table4">Table 4</a> was the age distribution for victims of sexual  		abuse. The age category with the highest proportion of sexual abuse was 3 to 5  		year olds, considerably younger than the average age of victims (9.19) noted  		among reports of sexual abuse (AAPC, 1988). However, a growing number of  		clinical studies, while often based on more limited samples, suggest that the  		onset of sexual abuse may occur when victims are much younger than implied in  		the reporting statistics. One major sexual abuse treatment center has reported  		that over 25% of their victims are five years of age or younger  		(Summit,1983).</p>

</tr></table><p>The only type of abuse showing a different distribution pattern by sex  		was child sexual abuse, where the victims were three times more likely to be  		female than male. Again, this pattern in consistent with the majority of  		clinical research and official reporting data (AAPC, 1988). However, like with  		age, extensive interviews with men incarcerated for child sexual abuse reveal a  		surprisingly high childhood victimization pattern involving males, as do  		interviews with random and nonrandom samples of adult males (Gebhard, Gagnon,  		Pomroy and Christenson, 1965; Finkelhor, 1979; Groth, 1983; Abel, Becker,  		Cunningham-Rathnor, Renlean, Kaplan and Raid, 1984; Finkelhor, 1984). These  		studies suggest that professionals may be disinclined to suspect sexual abuse  		with young boys, thereby accounting for the relatively low percentage of male  		victims reported to the Westat study team.</p>
<p>The only notable difference involving the victim's race were the  		over-representation of blacks in cases of physical neglect. The high proportion  		of blacks living below the poverty line and the well documented correlation  		between poverty and child neglect most likely account for this distribution  		(Pelton, 1981). Consistent with this pattern was the higher proportion of  		unemployed mothers reported for child neglect. These women most likely are  		parenting relatively young children (a situation correlated with a higher  		frequency of child neglect) or may be enrolled in a workfare/job placement  		program associated with AFDC (a variable also associated with a higher  		incidence of child neglect).</p>
<p>Significant differences were noted in the income for families involved  		in various types of maltreatment. While the over-representation of lower income  		families among cases of physical neglect was anticipated, the large proportion  		of families with annual incomes over $15,000 noted among those cases involving  		physical abuse was somewhat surprising. To a certain extent, this pattern  		underscores the universality of the child abuse problem, with income not being  		as strong a predictor of family violence as some would contend.</p>
<p>The typical family composition does differ by type of maltreatment. On  		balance, physical abuse and sexual abuse cases include a higher proportion of  		two parent families and single parent families headed by males while single  		parent families headed by women are overrepresented among cases involving  		physical neglect. Similarly, families with greater number of children are more  		common among cases involving physical neglect, while only children are  		overrepresented among cases of physical abuse and sexual abuse. Again, these  		patterns are not surprising and are consistent with the characteristics of  		these subpopulations reported by others (Finkelhor, 1986, Daro, 1988, AAPC,  		1988, and Gelles and Straus, 1989).</p>
<p>The NIS-2 methodology, namely the use of professionals to identify cases  		of maltreatment, may have its strongest impact with respect to the descriptions  		of various subpopulations. In interpreting the characteristics most likely  		associated with different forms of maltreatment, it is important to bear in  		mind that not all families or all children had an equal likelihood to be  		observed by the sentinels selected for this study. For example, young children  		had significantly less probability than school-aged children of being included  		in the study. Unless the child was in a day care center or was taken to a  		hospital emergency room with an injury serious enough to have warranted  		referring the child to a hospital social worker or had been formally reported  		to CPS, he or she would have had no way of being included in this study. In  		short, this data base may seriously underreport the range of maltreatment  		involving children under 5. A more accurate assessment of this population might  		have been possible had the study included a sample of pediatricians or  		professionals working in well-baby clinics.</p>
<p>This issue aside, the relatively modest differences observed among the  		various subpopulations suggest that the types of demographics included in the  		NIS-2 are generally poor predictors of maltreatment. With the possible  		exception of physical neglect, maltreatment does indeed cut across all income  		groups and family structures. If the NIS data is to be considered a useful  		empirical base for building credible models to distinguish among different  		types of maltreatment it may be necessary to include a broader range of  		variables than is currently available. Based on the experiences of others who  		have pursued this type of research, it appears essential to capture, in greater  		detail, perpetrator characteristics and the underlying personal and  		environmental factors which contribute to elevated risks for maltreatment.</p>
<h2><a name="compare" id="compare">COMPARISONS BETWEEN NIS-1 AND NIS-2</a></h2>
<p>The problems raised with respect to the weights and the differences in  		approach between the NIS-1 and the NIS-2 call into question the ability to  		generate valid statements regarding trends in child abuse levels between the  		two time periods. Of particular concern is the use of a 3-month data collection  		period in the NIS-2 study compared to a one year data collection period in the  		NIS-1 study; the differences in the representation of large counties in the two  		studies; and the duplication issue outlined earlier. While the Westat study  		team took great care to address all of these issues and to adhere to comparable  		methods in constructing the estimates used in both studies, the methodological  		issues noted by the statisticians in the NIS-2 approach precluded a definitive  		answer on this question. As has been discussed earlier, both the pool of  		sentinels utilized and the effects of weight trimming might have biased the  		estimate downwards, while the duplication issue might have had the opposite  		effect. While these factors may lead to inaccurate estimates of child  		maltreatment, they are not of utmost concern in explaining the observed  		differences between NIS-1 and NIS-2 since presumably the bias would have been  		roughly the same magnitude in both studies. Rather than resulting from  		methodological differences, it is more likely that the observed 66% increase in  		child abuse and neglect between 1980 and 1985 is an absolute increase resulting  		from a variety of factors, including professional awareness, environmental and  		economic changes and personal behavior.</p>
<p>As stipulated in our original research design, NCPCA staff informally  		polled a number of child welfare administrators, advocates and academic  		researchers regarding their opinions regarding the NIS-2 conclusion.  		Specifically, respondents were asked three questions relative to this  		issue:</p>
<ul><li>do you believe the incidence of child abuse increased markedly  		  between 1980 and 1985?</li>
<li>if so, do you perceive the increase to be solely a function of  		  increased professional awareness?</li>
<li>what alternative explanations can you suggest for the Westat  		  finding?</li>
</ul><p>Respondents also were asked how they have used the NIS-2 findings and  		how valid they considered the overall methodology to be in accurately measuring  		child abuse levels.</p>
<p><a href="../node/66106.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> lists the individuals contacted as  		part of this effort.</p>
<h3>Are Child Abuse Rates Going Up?</h3>
<p>Respondents noted that both NIS-1 and NIS-2 offer only an indication of  		the number of child abuse cases observed by professionals on an annual basis,  		not the true incidence of maltreatment. The issue under debate, therefore, is  		whether professionals identified more maltreatment cases in 1985 because they  		were more observant or because they come in contact with more actual cases. If  		one believes the latter explanation to be true, it does not necessarily follow  		that the total incidence of maltreatment has increased. Similar number of cases  		might have existed in 1980 but, for whatever reason, were not brought to the  		attention of professionals.</p>
<p>Only one-third of the respondents supported the Westat study team's  		interpretation of the findings, with the remaining two-thirds posturing  		alternative explanations for the documented 66% increase. All of those  		interviewed agreed that professional awareness and pressure to observe and  		report child abuse has increased in recent years, particularly with respect to  		child sexual abuse. Such pressure most certainly accounts for increased  		recognition of the problem. As one respondent noted, it is "implausible that  		three times as many Americans are having sex with their children as ten years  		ago." With respect to other forms of maltreatment, however, the majority of the  		respondents viewed increased awareness as accounting for only a fraction of the  		observed increase.</p>
<p>Factors identified as contributing to a real increase in the number of  		cases observed ranged from changes in the broader social-economic sphere, such  		as increased child poverty, homelessness and societal violence, to changes in  		family structure and parental behavior, such as divorce, teenage parenting and  		substance abuse. Interestingly, those respondents who spend the majority of  		their time conducting basic research or who work for the Federal Government  		were more likely than other respondents to support the Westat conclusion. Those  		more likely to disagree included child welfare administrators, child advocates  		and researchers who, in addition to research, spend a significant portion of  		their time in clinical settings. One reason for this division may be the  		influence reality plays in shaping one's perception of a given phenomenon.  		Rising reporting rates and a real increase in the number of serious physical  		and sexual abuse cases seen by local child protective service caseworkers seem  		indicative of a problem on the rise, not a problem under control.</p>
<p><a href="../node/66106.html#table5">Table 5</a> summarizes the arguments for and against  		the major interpretations of the 66% difference in the number of child abuse  		cases noted by professionals in 1980 and 1985. As this table indicates,  		compelling arguments can be made for each conclusion. Certainly, there has been  		an increase in professional recognition of child abuse, particularly child  		sexual abuse and within rural areas. A number of states require social workers,  		educators, and health care professionals to obtain special training on the  		identification and response to child abuse as a condition for certification or  		licensing. Beyond the formal training professionals receive on this topic is a  		general public which has less tolerance for all forms of maltreatment than in  		the past. To the extent professionals observe a child being beaten, belittled  		or neglected, they do appear more likely to labeled such behavior as child  		abuse than they might have in 1980.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the conditions in which a growing number of children  		live in this country are fertile grounds for mistreatment. The rate of child  		poverty, the growing number of children living in shelters for the homeless,  		and the drug epidemic has led many thoughtful observes to conclude that the  		risk for child abuse is higher today than at any time in recent memory. This  		increased risk coupled with a decrease in the range of supportive services for  		those families with the most limited resources give credence to the belief that  		serious child abuse may be on the rise.</p>

</tr></table><p>Little evidence exist to suggest that the 66% increase is merely an  		artifact of the methodology employed by Westat. While differences do exist in  		the sampling methods and statistical procedures employed in the two studies, it  		is not clear that these differences would account for such a dramatic increase  		in the number of observed cases.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not a method to determine, empirically, which  		arguments represent the "correct" interpretation of the Westat data. Only two  		of the respondents said that they use these data as a method for measuring  		change in the scope of the problem. As reported above, serious questions exist  		as to the validity of any NIS-1 and NIS-2 comparisons. The use of a different  		balance of sample counties, agencies and sentinels, coupled with the absence of  		any data regarding the training of these professionals, make it extremely  		difficult to "prove" professional awareness accounted for the entire 66%  		difference. Further, as constructed, the data base includes no information  		relative to the alternative explanations for this increase posed by our  		respondents. No data are available regarding the rates of poverty, domestic  		violence, homelessness, or substance abuse in the sample counties nor are there  		any indicators of the levels of social and health care services in the  		communities surveyed. In short, because the NIS-1 and NIS-2 do not offer  		definitive measures for the scope of the child abuse problem in 1980 and 1985,  		it remains a theoretical debate as to whether overall maltreatment rates have  		increased or simply moved up in the Westat pyramid design (i.e. cases  		previously known only to perpetrators or family members are now known to  		professionals).</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>The need for a National Incidence Study is self-evident. Both  		practitioners and policy makers want to know how much child abuse there is in  		this country and whether or not it is on the rise. In the absence of a National  		Incidence Study figure, the public and the professional community would be  		forced to rely upon reported rates of child abuse, taken from a system which  		suffers from many identifiable downward biases. For example, we know that the  		reporting rates between given states or counties will vary depending upon: (a)  		explicit state policy and definitions of maltreatment; (b) the extent to which  		funding for the local child welfare system is sufficient to allow for  		comprehensive investigations of all reports; and (c) the extent to which all  		potential abusers have an equal likelihood to be formally reported for  		maltreatment.</p>
<p>Given the need for a National Incidence Study, the question then becomes  		how best to accomplish this task. Presently the sole alternative methodology  		relies upon professional judgments to move beyond the estimated small  		percentage of actual cases which are formally reported. While everyone is in  		agreement that this approach does not identify the total universe of  		maltreatment cases, it is believed to represent a more comprehensive and  		potentially less biased estimate than that suggested by current reporting  		rates. Short of observing parental behavior in a random sample of American  		households, the method may indeed be the best available technology for moving  		the field closer to a more accurate estimate of the scope of the maltreatment  		problem. Despite the problems raised by the reviewers, both of the National  		Incidence Studies utilized justifiable methods and generated estimates, which  		if one accepts the majority of the assumptions made in the course of developing  		the study design, are as credible as anything currently available.</p>
<p>However, the vast number of assumptions underlying the development of  		national estimates using the present methodology and the inability to quantify  		the direction and size of the total bias resulting from each of these  		assumptions requires a tremendous leap of faith in accepting the final  		incidence figures as accurate. One needs to accept, as given, that valid  		estimates have been made for the level of duplication in the sample; the  		representativeness and comprehensiveness of the sample agencies and sentinels;  		and the appropriateness of the case weights, annualization rates and weight  		trimming. As suggested by the statisticians, it seems prudent to move  		cautiously in designing subsequent National Incidence Studies. Simple  		replication of the existing design is not viewed as the most useful course of  		action. Determining reliable estimates rests on the ability to establish a  		methodology based upon the fewest number of assumptions and, for those  		assumptions one does make, conducting the most stringent sensitivity tests  		possible so as to quantify the magnitude and direction of any potential' error  		introduced by these assumptions. As Dr. Frankel noted: "When the purpose of a  		survey is the estimation of a critical total, I believe that extensive  		justification should be provided for any shift from unbiased to biased  		estimation procedures." Each of the weighing systems employed in the NIS-2  		involved biased estimation procedures, procedures which were not in the view of  		the statisticians sufficiently justified, largely because the information  		needed to justify them is unavailable. We strongly recommend addressing this  		concern in designing any subsequent national incidence studies.</p>
<p>Further, future national incidence studies need to be designed with a  		careful eye toward the development of a data base which can address critical  		child welfare policy and program issues. To accomplish this task, additional  		data may need to be collected as part of the NIS. Specific changes which would  		increase the utility of the incidence data to address policy questions include  		information on agency policies, professional training and behavior with respect  		to reporting and various local systemic and environmental factors which  		influence maltreatment levels.</p>

<p>Dear Deborah:</p>
<p>The purpose of this letter is to provide a written report which assesses  		the sampling, weighting and statistical methods employed in conducting the  		NIS-2 Survey (Study of National Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse and  		Neglect). As per your specifications, the following questions are  		addressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did the sampling techniques employed produce an accurate and  		  representative sample of counties?</p>
<p>Did the sampling techniques employed produce an accurate and  		  representative sample of social service, criminal justice and health care  		  professionals?</p>
<p>Are cases weighted in a manner which provides for credible national  		  estimates?</p>
<p>Were comparisons with the 1980 data based on the accurate and  		  appropriate use of various statistical procedures?</p>
<p>Were the projections that were made on the two sets of definitions  		  used in NIS-2 valid?</p>
<p>What, if any, changes would you suggest in the sampling or methodology  		  if the study were to be repeated in several years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In providing my answers to these questions I have provided an overall  		answer of YES, NO or UNCERTAIN first. This overall answer is followed by an  		explanation.</p>
<p><b>Did the sampling techniques employed produce an accurate and  		representative sample of counties?</b></p>
<p>YES</p>
<p>The term accuracy is generally used to in conjunction with an estimate  		produced by a sample. The term representative is generally used, in a  		non-technical sense, to describe a sample that is selected in such a way that  		it has the potential for producing accurate and reliable estimates.</p>
<p>It is clear from the NIS-2 documentation that sample of counties was  		selected in such a way that a probability sample was produced. As such, the  		sample has the potential for use in the production of unbiased estimates with  		known<sup><font><a href="../node/66106.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> reliability.</p>
<p><b>Did the sampling techniques employed produce an accurate and  		representative sample of social service, criminal justice and health care  		professionals?</b></p>
<p>UNCERTAIN</p>
<p>Within selected counties the selection of social service, criminal  		justice and health care professionals involved a two stage sampling process. In  		the first stage of within county sampling (second stage, overall), sampling  		frames of agencies was constructed and a probability selection was carried out  		from this frame. In the second stage of within county sampling (third stage,  		overall) sampling frames of individuals were constructed and these were sampled  		by probability methods.</p>
<p>However, the probability or non-probability nature of the sample of  		professions selected by this process rests on a number of critical assumptions.  		First, is the assumption that all appropriate health care professions within  		the county are included in the frames that were prepared.</p>
<p>Insufficient information is provided in the technical documentation for  		the to assess the degree to which these assumptions are fully satisfied. I have  		particular questions about the frame of child care centers, as well as the  		within agency frames in the case of hospitals, schools, and child care  		centers.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to know if any procedures were used to assure  		the completeness of the frame of child care centers. I would also like to know  		what procedures were used to assure that the person level frames within  		selected agencies were complete and up to date. Pending the resolution of these  		questions, I am not in a position to assess the probability nature of the  		sample of social service, criminal justice and health care professionals.</p>
<p><b>Are cases weighted in a manner which provides for credible national  		estimates?</b></p>
<p>UNCERTAIN, and very probably NO</p>
<p>The most serious questions that I have concerning the estimates produced  		by the NIS-2 are related to the weighting of cases. In particular, I question  		the validity of the assumptions that were used in dealing with the potential  		problems of duplication of cases within CPS agencies and within non-CPS  		agencies and professionals, the duplication of cases between the various CPS  		and non-CPS providers and the duplication of cases over time  		(annualization).</p>
<p>On page 6-23 of the <b>Report on Data Processing &amp; Analysis: Study  		of National Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse and Neglect: 1988</b> the  		following paragraph appears:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The attempt for obtain unbiased estimates of the extent for  		  duplication in a population by using the incidence of duplicates in a sample  		  can only rarely produce reliable estimates (footnote L.Kish (1965). Survey  		  Sampling. New York John Wiley and Sons. See remark 11.2.1), and can often lead  		  to negative estimates of population counts. For this reason, that approach was  		  not used with the NIS-2 database. Instead, a more robust approach (albeit a  		  biased one) was used."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am in agreement with this paragraph that the approach used was biased.  		This is also pointed out by Kish on page 390 "Note that eliminating only the  		duplicate selections actually found in the sample would not correct the  		selection bias."</p>
<p>I am in disagreement with the implication that the procedure adopted was  		more robust.</p>
<p><b>The problem with the approach used is that no attempt has been made  		to quantify the magnitude of the bias. We are certain that the procedure is  		biased, but we do not know the size of the bias. We can not assume that the  		impact of the bias is small. The impact on the final estimates might be 5%, or  		it might be 75% or more. We just do not know.</b></p>
<p>In addition to the potentially serious bias introduced by ignoring the  		problem of "hidden" duplication in the population, I have a number of questions  		about the potential bias introduced by the "Reliability Adjustment" (p.6-20),  		the "Exit Evaluation Adjustment" (p. 6-21) and "Weight Trimming" (p. 6-28). Not  		enough detail is provided in order fully understand these adjustments or  		speculate on their potential bias impact. When the purpose of a survey is the  		estimation of a critical total, I believe that extensive justification should  		be provided for an shift from unbiased to biased estimation procedures.</p>
<p><b>Were comparisons with the 1980 data based on the accurate and  		appropriate use of various statistical procedures?</b></p>
<p>UNCERTAIN</p>
<p>Insufficient detail about the 1980 study was provided in order to answer  		this question. It appears that significant changes were made in the sample  		design and weighting procedures from HIS-1 to NIS-2. To the extent that the  		bias of the weighting procedures was different in the 1988 from 1980, this  		would impact the accuracy and appropriateness of NIS-1 to NIS-2 comparisons. In  		summary, it appears to be impossible to definitively attribute differences  		between results in the NIS-1 and the NIS-2 to either real change or method  		effect. It might be either or it might be both.</p>
<p><b>Were the projections that were made on the two sets of definitions  		used in NIS-2 valid?</b></p>
<p>UNCERTAIN</p>
<p>My, uncertainty about the validity of the two sets of definitions use in  		NIS-2 is linked to my uncertainty about the sampling of professionals and the  		weighting that was used in projection. The sampling and weighting were proper,  		then it is certainly possible to develop two valid sets of projections based on  		two sets of definitions, within the same sample survey.</p>
<p><b>What, if any, chances would you suggest in the sampling or  		methodology if the study were to be repeated in several years?</b></p>
<p>I would recommend that an extensive study be carried out in order to  		provide empirical evidence about the amount and nature of report duplication in  		three dimensions: within agency, across persons in the same agency, across  		agencies, across persons in different agencies and across time. This study  		should focus on large and medium sized counties, where extensive sampling is  		employed.</p>
<p>This empirical information is required in order to allow for the design  		of an NIS that will provide scientifically credible estimates.</p>

<p>Dear Deborah:</p>
<p>This letter contains my responses to the six questions you asked the  		statisticians to address in Task 2. My responses are based on the materials you  		mailed me: <b>Study Findings, Final Report: Appendices, Report on Data  		Processing &amp; Analyses, Report on Data Collection, Report on County Sample  		Selection Process</b> and <b>Public Use Tape Documentation Manual</b>.</p>
<p><b>Did the sampling techniques employed produce an accurate and  		representative sample of counties?</b></p>
<p>Probably yes.</p>
<p>All U.S. counties with at least 2,800 children in school were stratified  		by geographic region and degree of urbanization. Within each cell formed by  		these strata, counties were listed sequentially from northeast to southwest.  		Each was assigned a size equal to the number of children in school within the  		county. By dividing the total number of children in school in all counties by  		27, a sampling interval was chosen that would yield a final cluster sample of  		27 counties. Using a random number to initiate the selection process, a  		systematic sample was drawn by using the sample interval to choose counties  		proportional to size within each cell.</p>
<p>For the purpose of sampling, contiguous counties with less than 2,800  		were aggregated until their combined size totalled at least 2,800 children. One  		of the set of combined counties was chosen at random. It turned out to be  		composed of two, individual counties. The 27 combined counties and 2 combined  		counties were designated sampling units) of the study.</p>
<p>My one suggestion on sampling would be to statistically test how  		representative of the universe of counties within its cell each selected sample  		of counties is. This could be done not only for the two strata dimensions of  		geography and population density, but also with respect to other  		characteristics possibly related to child maltreatment such as income  		distribution and racial/ethnic composition.</p>
<p><b>Did the sampling techniques employed produce an accurate and  		representative sample of social service, criminal justice and health care  		professionals?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but I have some reservations.</p>
<p>The selection of non-CPS agencies is detailed in Chapter II of the  		<b>Report on Data Collection</b>.</p>
<p>Juvenile Probation Departments, County Sheriff/State Police and County  		Public Health Departments were censused within each PSU. They are therefore  		representative.</p>
<p>Schools, day care centers, hospitals, municipal police departments and  		social services/mental health agencies were all sampled within PSU. Whether  		they are likely to be representative depends on how the sampling was done.</p>
<p>Schools were stratified by grade spans (K-5, 6-9, 7-12), and further by  		size (over or under 1,000 students) and/or by race (over or under 50% white  		students) if there were a sufficient number of schools to form one or both of  		these additional strata. A random sample of ten schools was chosen from the  		cells formed by these strata so that the number of sampled schools in each cell  		was roughly proportional to the total number of schools in each cell.</p>
<p>Unless a goal of NIS-2 was to compare small to large schools, I wonder  		why schools were not randomly sampled proportional to size within grade and  		(possibly) race categories. Given that the student enrollment for each school  		in a PSU was readily available, this selection method might have sharpened  		incidence estimates.</p>
<p>The national universe of day care centers available for sampling came  		from a list purchased from a market research company. Was this list  		comprehensive? In the text, Westat discusses the high rate of turnover for day  		care centers without mention of any steps to verify how complete the list was.  		</p>
<p>Within each PSU, day care centers were ordered by descending enrollment.  		A systematic sample of twenty day care centers was then selected with  		probability proportional to size (enrollment) after random choice of a starting  		number. As high refusal rates were anticipated, day care centers were  		oversampled in the ratio of three backup centers for each primary (targeted)  		center.</p>
<p>Short-stay, general or children's general hospitals with 4,000 or more  		annual admissions were eligible for inclusion. In PSU's with 6 or less  		hospitals, all were selected. Otherwise, hospitals were sampled.</p>
<p>Children's hospitals were always selected. Public hospitals were  		selected with greater probability than private hospitals and hospitals with  		fewer than 4,000 admissions a year were only used where necessary. Hospitals  		were stratified into four size categories.</p>
<p>No further details are provided on how hospitals were sampled after they  		had been typed and sized. I assume there was random selection within the cells  		formed by the type and size strata.</p>
<p>I also assume that the census of children's hospitals and oversampling  		of public hospitals was an attempt to concentrate sentinels in institution  		types that were less prevalent or in settings where rates of child maltreatment  		cases seen were thought to be higher. The latter consideration would increase  		the number of countable cases reported to CPS from institutions with higher  		rates of such cases, thus improving the precision of incidence estimates.</p>
<p>A similar sampling strategy was followed with police departments. The  		larger the municipality served by the police department was, the higher was the  		police department's probability of selection into the sample.</p>
<p>All departments were taken in PSU's with 5 or fewer departments. In  		other PSU's, between 4 and 7 departments were sampled depending, among other  		things, on the number of police departments and the population of the PSU's.  		The area served by each department was assigned to one of six population  		strata. Probability of selection varied by stratum size from certainty in the  		stratum for cities of 500,000 or more to lower probabilities for strata with  		successively smaller population ranges. This method of sampling may be expected  		to generate larger numbers of countable maltreatment cases and more precise  		estimates of incidence than, for example, selecting departments proportional to  		size.</p>
<p>All known social services and mental health agencies were considered for  		the sampling frame except for government-administered social services agencies.  		To be included in the sampling frame the agency also had to be a nonresidential  		provider of counselling, therapy and/or emotional support to families or  		children in the general population of the PSU's, and to know its clients well  		enough to complete the non-CPS study data form.</p>
<p>Westat compiled a sampling frame from yellow pages listings of "social  		services," special directories of community services, and the knowledge of CPS  		staff and key participants at non-CPS study agencies.</p>
<p>From the sampling frame they took all agencies from PSU's with 4 or less  		agencies, and sampled 4 or 5 agencies randomly from the remaining PSU's.</p>
<p>I have two concerns about the sampling of social services and mental  		health agencies. Why was size of agency in terms of number of clients or  		families served not considered in selecting agencies? Why were only 3 to 5  		agencies selected regardless of the number of agencies in the PSU? (To take an  		extreme instance, 5 of 9 agencies were selected in Kern, CA and 5 of 235  		agencies were selected in Los Angeles.) Ignoring size in sampling agencies  		coupled with the small sample of agencies from areas of high population density  		lead to imprecise incidence estimates of the countable maltreatment cases  		reported to CPS from social services and mental health agencies, especially  		from the PSU's that contain large cities.</p>
<p><b>Are cases weighted in a manner which provides for credible, national  		estimates?</b></p>
<p>Probably yes. My confidence in the work would rise if Westat answered  		questions I have about how some of the statistical formulas used were derived,  		filled in omitted steps in argument and exposition, and demonstrated that the  		weighting methodology was executed without major errors.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 of the <b>Report on Data Processing &amp; Analysis</b>  		presents the weighting and estimation methodology. The statisticians provided a  		methodology so that each countable case could be assigned a weight for each of  		a number of properties it might have. A final case weight, derived from the  		individual weights, represents an estimate of the number of cases with these  		properties one might expect to see if a national census of maltreated children  		were taken.</p>
<p>I believe that the statisticians considered all the properties of cases  		that needed weighting. However, in reviewing Chapter 6, I was not always sure  		what they had done. I can't tell whether all of the quantities derived in the  		tables of Chapter 6 were calculated from the appropriate formula. There are  		entries in both the text and tables that are wrong. Clearly, the quality of  		Chapter 6 is inferior to the quality of other parts of NIS-2 I have reviewed.  		These problems may cast doubt on the validity of the final incidence  		figures.</p>
<p>Because of the length and complexity of chapter 6, I am not going to try  		to summarize and review each aspect of the work. Instead, I will state my  		questions and concerns with the corresponding page references.</p>
<p>Non-response adjustments for agencies were made across PSU's, within  		agency type and by non-response classes within agency. Is this sufficient? If  		the causes of non-response are related to countable cases encountered by an  		agency, then further adjustment would be required to avoid bias. There are two  		problems: non-response of an agency and non-response to particular items or  		questions on a report form. (See <b>Statistical Analysis with Missing Data</b>,  		Roderick J.A. Little &amp; Donald B. Rubin, John Wiley, 1987. Also, see  		<b>Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys</b>, Donald B. Rubin, John  		Wiley, 1987.)</p>
<p>I am not sure what the quantity n<sub>h</sub> on page 6-3 represents.  		Section 6.2.1.1 says that 110 hospitals were originally selected, and on page  		6-4 n<sub>h</sub> is defined as "the number originally selected." The selected  		column in Table 6-1 totals 104. This disagrees with 110, the number originally  		selected. It also disagrees with 105, the number obtained by adding to 110 the  		4 replacement hospitals and subtracting from 114 the 9 out-of-scope hospitals.  		If n<sub>h</sub> is indeed the number of hospitals originally selected, I am  		puzzled by the formula for P<sub>g</sub> on page 6-3 whose denominator in the  		numerator of the entire expression is n<sub>h</sub> + a<sub>h</sub> +  		c<sub>h</sub>. This seems to double count the last two terms which are already  		present in n<sub>h</sub>. I would have thought that the proportion out-of-scope  		in a stratum would have been (a<sub>h</sub> + b<sub>h</sub>) /  		n<sub>h</sub>.</p>
<p>I would appreciate written clarification on the definition of quantities  		as well as the argument that led to this formula and the formula for hospital  		weights on page 6-4 which uses P<sub>g</sub>. These formulas or variants of  		them are used repeatedly in Chapter 6 to assign weights to the various  		agencies.</p>
<p>In table 6-1 my calculation of the out-of-scope adjustment for hospital  		strata 5,6 and 7 in PSU 25 yields 0.80, not 0.93 as reported. Four out-of-scope  		adjustments of 0.81 reported for PSU 5, strata 5 and 6, and PSU 6, strata 3 and  		5, should be 0.80 and not 0.81. And why is stratum 6 in PSU 6 not combined with  		stratum 5 as it is in PSU 5?</p>
<p>Table 6-2 also confuses me. For small hospitals (stratum 8), table 6-1  		shows 1 hospital that refused and was not replaced. Whether the adjustment  		factor is calculated as 10/9 or as 11/10, the result is not 1.016999 as in the  		table. Perhaps size measures were used to calculate the adjustment factors. Bow  		were the adjustment factors for non-response in Table 6-2 calculated?</p>
<p>For schools on pages 6-7 and 6-8, the questions on the formulas for  		P<sub>g</sub> and for W<sub>h</sub>, the agency weight for stratum h in group  		g, carry over from my queries about hospitals.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have some problems with Table 6-3 which derives school  		agency weights. First, PSU 18, stratum 1 shows 85 schools sampled out of 8 in  		the frame. This is a typo, and should have been 5 schools.</p>
<p>Page 6-7 states that replacement selections were made for 17 schools.  		The total shown in Table 6-3 is 15.</p>
<p>For the purpose of calculating the estimated proportion out-of-scope,  		the strata that were combined sometimes varied by PSU. For example, in PSU 3,  		strata 4 and 5 are combined to yield an estimate for both strata of 0.2981. In  		PSU 17, strata 5 and 6 are combined to produce a joint out-of-scope estimate of  		0.2241 while stratum 4 gets an out-of-scope estimate of 0. PSU 25, stratum 5  		gets an out-of-scope estimate of 0.5 while its stratum 4 gets an out-of-scope  		estimate of 0. Can Westat supply a rationale for the apparent  		inconsistencies?</p>
<p>On page 6-8 I do not see where the formula for day care center weights  		W<sub>ij</sub> comes from. Also the total sample size in table 6-5 is 124.  		Above the table it is claimed that "Of the 141 day care centers recruited, 16  		... refused" leaving 125 in the sample. Also, in this table I am not sure how  		the adjustment factor was calculated. Was the cumulative size of 311 centers in  		a region-urbanization category divided by the cumulative size of all  		cooperating centers in that category?</p>
<p>For social services and mental health agencies the weight formula given  		on page 6-14 and the weights calculated in table 6-6 have no out-of-scope  		adjustment. Yet, on page 6-14 Westat declares that "of the 218 selections, 110  		were out-of-scope." Why did Westat not make out-of-scope adjustments here when  		they had previously?</p>
<p>Additionally, refusals were not, as with other agencies, handled with a  		separate adjustment that, I presume, would be used as a multiplier of the  		weight. Rather, as with out-of-scope agencies they were included in both the  		numerator and denominator of the single weight calculated for these agencies.  		Given the absence of stratification for social services and mental health  		agencies, I don't think this approach biased the weights.</p>
<p>For the sampling of municipal police departments, out-of-scopes were  		included in both the frame count and sample count on page 6-17. Again, I don't  		understand why Westat departed from previous practice with these agencies.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in this portion of the chapter the tables get out of  		sequence. Table 6-7 precedes table 6-6 and table 6-9 precedes table 6-8.</p>
<p>On page 6-23 the assumption under which duplication weights were derived  		for reports of countable cases is given. This is "that no more duplication  		occurred in the population than was seen in the sample. That is, if a case was  		found to be duplicated, it was assumed that there were no more duplicates in  		the population. When no duplicates were found in the sample for a given case,  		it was assumed to be entirely unduplicated in the population."</p>
<p>If I understand this assumption correctly as applying to the entire PSU,  		it must lead to an upward bias in the estimate of incidence. Suppose, for  		example, we find an unduplicated case in a hospital. Can we assume that the  		case has not been recorded in any other non-sampled agency of whatever type?  		Might there be a correlation with severity of maltreatment and duplication so  		that the assumption causes a bias that varies with severity? Perhaps cases with  		moderate harm to the child are more apt to be duplicated since cases where the  		injury is severe or fatal are not as likely to be transferred from one agency  		to another. And what distinction, if any, is made between the duplication of a  		single maltreatment and two maltreatments that occur within the three-month  		sampling window?</p>
<p>On pages 6-21 and 6-22 "Exit Evaluation Adjustment" is described. Each  		participant was rated on a 0 to 5 scale on the level and quality of his/her  		participation. Each group weight was inflated by the ratio of the total number  		of participants to the number of participants with favorable (3 or higher)  		ratings. We are not told how this group weight was derived. I am also uncertain  		whether individual participants were separately weighted or whether a single  		weight for the group was derived. And I would like to know more about the  		criteria used to rate each participant on the 0 to 5 scale. If the phenomenon  		of partial participation was at all widespread it seems important to assess it  		as accurately as possible. Otherwise large errors and/or biases would degrade  		incidence estimates.</p>
<p>On page 6-25 a formula for weighting intra-agency duplicates from the  		non-CPS sector is given. I do not understand how that formula was derived.</p>
<p>Similarly, I do not understand why the exponent (1 + m/n) is needed in  		the formula on 6-26. 'm' is the number of CPS short form reports, and 'n' is  		the number of CPS long form reports.</p>
<p>Westat describes the process of trimming its final weights to reduce  		sampling error on pages 6-28 through 6-29. On page 6-29 they claim that "the  		increase in precision outweigh[ed] the addition of bias." The reduction in the  		mean weight was 3% from 163.3 to 158.3, and the reduction in the coefficient of  		variation of the weights was 17%.</p>
<p>I am not an expert on trimming, and have only seen it applied to data in  		both tails of a distribution. But I wonder whether bias could not have been  		controlled better if some of the low-end weights had been raised so that the  		mean remained stable. Another possibility might have been to apply some  		compressive function such as a log to the weights. I am not saying that I  		disagree with what the Westat statisticians did, but that I am uncomfortable  		with a technique that invariably produces a bias in one direction.</p>
<p>On page 6-36 I am not familiar with the jackknifed variance estimation  		of Rust and Kalton. Would Westat be willing to send me a copy of their article?  		The reference is K. Rust &amp; G. Kalton (1987), "Strategies for Collapsing  		Strata for Variance Estimation", J. Official Statist., 3(1), 69-81.</p>
<p><b>Were the comparisons with the 1980 data based on the accurate and  		appropriate, use of various, statistical procedures?</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Appendix E of <b>Final Report: Appendices</b> describes how the over  		time analyses were performed. The standard techniques of t-tests and Analysis  		of Variance were used to derive estimates. However, two modifications were  		introduced to compensate for the multiple and complex dependencies introduced  		by multi-stage cluster sampling so that these procedures produced statistics  		described as "t-like" and "F-like."</p>
<p>The first technique, that of jackknifing estimates of variance, I  		mentioned at the end of the last section. As I understand it, in NIS-2, 28  		estimates of the mean are made by dropping one PSU at a time, reweighting up  		the three other PSU's in its foursome of demographically similar PSU's, and  		leaving the remaining 24 PSU's with their original weights. A comparable  		technique was used for NIS-1 PSU's. The variance of these estimates around the  		estimate of the mean made from the full sample can then be computed. This  		number is a superior estimate of the true, but unknown, variance since it does  		not assume that maltreatment cases came from a simple random sample. Rather,  		the jackknified variance estimate will reflect whatever dependencies arise from  		the cluster sampling design even though we may not be aware of them.</p>
<p>The second modification was a reduction in the degrees of freedom  		associated with a test statistic. Westat denotes the t-like and F-like  		statistics by t' and F'. A degree of freedom represents one independent  		measurement of the value of a variable. Clearly, the degrees of freedom can not  		be based on the case weights as each observation has been weighted up by one to  		several orders of magnitude to generate national estimates.</p>
<p>What Westat reports having done on page E-7 is to take as the maximum  		number of degrees of freedom available .... the number of independent jackknife  		replicate estimates used in generating the [variance] estimate (21 for the  		NIS-2 estimates)," and, I believe, 13 for the NIS-1 variance estimates.</p>
<p>Where the F' statistic is used, as in determining whether there is age  		by year interaction in the incidence of sexual misuse or physical abuse between  		studies, further reduction in degrees of freedom was made. Age was collapsed  		into 6 levels for the purpose of comparing NIS-1 and NIS-2 incidence. This  		would, I believe, imply 6*((13-1) + (21-1)) = 192 degrees of freedom for the  		error sum of squares estimate in an ANOVA. Westat essentially argues on page  		E-7 that because the samples in different cells are not independent and the  		variance within cells may not be constant, the true degrees of freedom would  		lie between (13-1) + (21-1) = 32 and 192. Their actual quote is that the  		"degrees of freedom for the SS within is between a number somwhat less than q  		and m*q." I think they must have meant 'a number between q and m*q.'</p>
<p>In the example just given I wonder if the degrees of freedom might be  		specified more exactly. It might entail working with the ratio of probabilities  		of drawing the obtained sample under random sampling to drawing it under the  		multi-stage cluster sampling actually used. Furthermore, since the constancy of  		variance within cells can and should be statistically tested any time an ANOVA  		or t-test is conducted, should degree of freedom reductions be made unless test  		results indicate non-constancy of within-cell variance?</p>
<p>In reporting final results Westat based degrees of freedom on weights  		with footnotes indicating when degrees of freedom based on observations over  		all cells, or observations in a single cell would have made significance levels  		marginal or non-significant. In my opinion, the body of the report should have  		used degrees of freedom based on observations over all cells since false  		positives may result in misdirected effort and expenditure.</p>
<p>Would Westat be willing to clarify a question I have on notation? On  		page E-7 'q' is defined as "the number of independent replicate estimates  		available for each cell." On the next page, E-8, 'q' is defined as "the number  		of levels for the factor under consideration." I had thought that 'm', defined  		on page E-7 as "[the number of] independently sampled cells" was equivalent to  		the definition of 'q' on page E-8.</p>
<p><b>Were the projections that were made on the two sets of definitions  		used in NIS-2 valid?</b></p>
<p>If I may replace the word "projections" with the word "estimates," my  		answer is yes.</p>
<p>Page 2-6 of <b>Study Findings</b> refers to the two sets of definitions  		used for determining countability in NIS-2 as "original" and "revised." The  		original definitions were identical to those of NIS-1 "concerning both the  		<b>perpetrator</b> of the acts/omissions and the degree of <b>harm</b> to the  		child." The revised definitions expanded the degree of harm to include  		<b>endangerment</b> and relaxed criteria as to what constitutes  		perpetration.</p>
<p>Comparisons between years were made using the more restrictive original  		definitions. Estimates confined to NIS-2 cases were made using the expanded,  		revised definitions. Within NIS-2, the sample of cases meeting the original  		definitions was a subset of the sample of cases-meeting the expanded  		definitions.</p>
<p>From my reading of Chapter 6 of the <b>Report on Data Processing &amp;  		Analysis</b>, I do not think separate weights were (or needed to be) calculated  		for the cases in the "original" and "revised" NIS-2 samples. However, incidence  		estimates for NIS-1 were re-estimated by the same method by which NIS-2  		estimates were made. Westat found that the NIS-2 method led to more precise  		incidence estimates (page 6-31, section 6.7).</p>
<p>They proceed, on page 6-31, to describe a difference in the way  		population totals were incorporated into estimation of incidence rates as  		opposed to estimation of total cases: "Estimates of incidence rates were found  		to be more precise when these were based entirely on the sample (i.e., used  		estimates of the U.S. population totals based on the sample of study  		counties).... However, estimates of totals were more accurate when these  		incorporated more reliable population size figures for the period in question  		using census data."</p>
<p>How this was implemented is not evident to me from the formulas for  		incident rate,r, and estimated total, y', on page 6-32. In the formula for  		incidence rate P<sub>h</sub> "denotes the population of persons under 18 in PSU  		h." The formula for total number is y' = rP, where "P denotes the population of  		persons under 18 in the U.S." Does the second part of the quoted passage in the  		preceding paragraph merely mean that the incidence rate was multiplied by the  		census population of the U.S.?</p>
<p><b>What if any changes would you suggest in the sampling or methodology  		if the study was to be repeated in several years?</b></p>
<p>If the primary focus of the study is with changes in incidence , I would  		select the same 29 counties that were used in NIS-2. I would also determine  		whether the population densities (urbanization) of those counties was  		representative of the entire nation.</p>
<p>From the 28 PSU's formed by these counties, I would randomly select one  		or two small PSU's with the goal of surfacing a higher proportion of the child  		maltreatment incidents that occurred within the PSU. On page 7-2 of the  		"Summary and Conclusions" chapter of <b>Study Findings</b> Westat lists  		numerous sources of knowledge about child maltreatment that were not tapped by  		NIS-2. These include "private schools, private physicians, medical clinics not  		affiliated with hospitals or health departments, clinical social workers or  		mental health professionals in private practice ... neighbors, relatives and  		the children themselves." Westat concludes: "Thus, the estimates provided by  		this study should be regarded as <b>minimum estimates</b> of the numbers of  		abused and neglected children." I would have added that the study estimates  		must be underestimates unless we believe that all of these listed sources taken  		together would add a negligible number of new countable cases to the pool.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, I urge that statistical sampling of these sources  		be taken within the one or two PSU's selected for comprehensive coverage. Field  		interviews and investigations might enable us to uncover a substantial  		proportion of countable cases that are now, presumably, undetected.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, I would also try to obtain more evidence on the  		cause(s) of the increase between 1980 and 1986 in the incidence of moderate  		sexual and physical abuse that widened with increasing age of the child. See  		Section 5.2.3 of <b>Study Findings</b>. This is an important question, for if  		the observed increase in incidence is due, in substantial part, to an increase  		in maltreatment of older children, then there has been a dramatic increase in  		violence towards older children in the space of 6 years.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, "Summary and Conclusions," of <b>Study Findings</b>,  		Westat examines three alternative explanations to the increase cited in the  		previous paragraph: study methodology, increased reporting, and increased  		recognition. Westat essentially rejects methodology and reporting as causes of  		the increase in incidence by appealing to quantitative evidence from the study.  		I would like to see these arguments presented more fully with the quantitative  		evidence that supports them.</p>
<p>Having rejected the hypotheses of methodology and reporting, Westat  		accepts the hypothesis of recognition. Their argument is, basically, that if  		violence toward children had increased over the six year period, we would  		expect it to manifest rather uniformly across all categories of severity,  		across emotional as well as sexual and physical abuse, and across all ages.</p>
<p>Two additional arguments might be made to support Westat's position. The  		first is based on a study conducted by Richard J. Gelles and Murray A. Straus.  		They found that "in a telephone survey of two parent families with children  		over three years of age ... [there was] a decrease in the self-reported  		incidence of physical abuse by parents between 1975 and 1985." (See <b>Study  		Findings</b>, page xi.) Suppose, that during that decade, abusing parents felt  		themselves to be at greater risk of detection and punishment by the state. I  		would then expect a decrease in self-reported incidence as well as an increase  		in incidence by community professionals due to increased recognition and  		increased reporting.</p>
<p>The second argument concerns the magnitude of the increase. Incidence of  		physical abuse had increased by 58% and sexual abuse more than tripled between  		1980 and 1986. (See <b>Study Findings</b>, page xxi.) I would only find changes  		of that magnitude credible if the level of stress and of violence in the  		society at large had climbed dramatically over the six year period.</p>
<p>One way of testing the "recognition" hypothesis would be to survey the  		media over the six-year period. On television, in newspapers, in magazines, in  		the professional journals, is the amount of space devoted to child maltreatment  		increasing? Of the total space devoted to child maltreatment in a particular  		medium, has the proportion devoted to sexual or physical abuse of older  		children been increasing? During the 1980-86 period, have child protection laws  		and regulations been expanded to cover older children? Do community  		professionals feel their attention on child abuse, particularly older children,  		has been increasing over the last five or ten years? </p>

<p>Dear Deborah:</p>
<p>As a statistician I appreciate Karl Ensign's desire "to pin down Marty  		Frankel and Tom Marx as much as possible concerning the effects of bias on the  		measurement of abuse and neglect." If I could have delivered to you the type of  		quantitative bias estimates that Karl depicts in his graph, broken out by  		source of bias, I would have.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after I completed my review of NIS-2, I felt that I did  		not possess sufficient information to make quantitative estimates of the  		effects of bias by source. These information lacks fell into three categories:  		What did Westat do? What were the means, variances etc. of quantities that  		would permit an estimate of bias? Did the incomplete and careless work in the  		exposition, explanation and presentation of results, formulas and procedures  		carry over to data collection, data cleaning and data processing?</p>
<p>In the rest of this letter, I am going to respond to the points Karl  		raised in his letter to you of 10 May. Then I will recommend how I think HHS  		ought to fund NIS-3.</p>
<p><b>Karl's Letter</b></p>
<p>Slope A in Karl's graph is possible except I don't know to what extent  		cities were underrepresented in NIS-1, what the difference in incidence rates  		between cities and non-cities was in either NIS-1 or NIS-2, or by how much  		duplication in NIS-2 biased incidence estimates upwards. (I must admit that our  		long, conference telephone conversation on the duplication question didn't  		clear it up for me.)</p>
<p>In calculating annual rates, Westat adjusted both for seasonality and  		multiple, different episodes of abuse within the year. The duplication  		adjustment was applied independently. For this reason I don't think  		annualization interacts with duplication bias, if it exists.</p>
<p>Data trimming does introduce a small bias in the mean. Westat found a 3%  		downward bias in the trimmed mean. They traded this downward bias for a 17%  		reduction in the coefficient of variation. This implies a 19% reduction in the  		standard deviation. Although the SD may be biased from events that took place  		before trimming, the SD is not biased by trimming. It is the SD of the weighted  		and trimmed data. The reason Westat trimmed was to achieve a large reduction in  		the SD thereby increasing the power of statistical tests of significance.</p>
<p>Karl thought that the reduction in variance (or equivalently SD)  		affected the slope of the line connecting the Abuse/Neglect incidence rate  		estimates of NIS-1 and NIS-2. This is not so. The variance reduction makes it  		more likely that an incidence rate change between NIS-1 and NIS-2 is detected  		by a t' or F' test.</p>
<p>Karl advocates that "one should pay attention to the effects of data  		weighting." I couldn't agree more. With case weights differing by several  		orders of magnitude and an extremely complex, multi-stage, weighting procedure,  		the potential for huge, unpredictable biases exists. The questions I had posed  		on weighting in my report to you were not answered in our conference call. (I  		think a better way to have answered these questions would have been through a  		letter to you, Frankel and me from Westat's statistician.) Additionally, how do  		we know that the complex weighting scheme, even if correct, was correctly  		implemented by the Westat computer programs?</p>
<p>My concern about the undersampling of social services and mental health  		agencies in large PSUs cited by Karl leads not to increases in bias, but to  		increases in the error or uncertainty of incidence estimates. In other words,  		the undersampling in large PSUs inflates variance, thus decreasing power. (To  		provide a quantitative estimate of the inflation, more information would be  		required than I found in the Westat reports.)</p>
<p><b>Recommendations for NIS-3</b></p>
<p>NIS-3 should be preceded by a methodological study that covers study  		design, sampling, data collection, data cleaning and statistical analyses. The  		methodological study should begin with an audit of NIS-1 and NIS-2.</p>
<p>What's worked from the first two surveys should be kept. What hasn't  		worked should be improved. If the audit uncovered errors that had a major  		impact on NIS-1 or NIS-2 estimates and statistical tests, the data should be  		reanalyzed.</p>
<p>One thought I had on the duplication issue was that this attribute of  		the universe of cases may be captured by random sampling just as any other  		attribute (such as age of victim) can. As long as cases are randomly selected  		from the universe, the duplication rate in the sample will estimate the  		duplication in the universe.</p>
<p>If the sample size is chosen to attain some specified power, additional  		cases could be sampled to make up the loss in sample size occasioned by  		duplicates. If an initial sample of size n had a duplication rate of r, then a  		second stage sample of size rn/(l-r) would increase the sample size enough to  		approximate the desired power. If a two-stage sample draw were infeasible, r  		might be guessed and a single sample of size n/(1-r) selected.</p>
<p>Once the methodological study was completed and approved, NIS-3 proper  		could begin. In funding the methodological study and NIS-3, I recommend that  		HHS be sure the contractor(s) have satisfactory fees and ample deadlines. In  		particular, if funds are limited, I think HHS should reduce the scope of the  		study rather than asking the contractor to complete the full scope as best it  		can. Without knowing anything about why Westat produced some inferior work, I  		would guess that it was deadline pressure, money pressure, or both. </p>
<p>Sincerely yours, /s/ Tom Marx, Ed.D.</p>
