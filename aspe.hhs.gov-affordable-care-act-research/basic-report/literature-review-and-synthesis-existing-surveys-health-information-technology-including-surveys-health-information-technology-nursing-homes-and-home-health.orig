</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>In an effort to better understand the current use and adoption rates of  		electronic health records and other health information technology (HIT)  		applications within nursing homes, the Division of Health Care Policy and  		Research at the University of Colorado Denver has been contracted by the Office  		of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department  		of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop survey instruments for use in  		long-term care provider settings. Although numerous survey instruments have  		been fielded to assess HIT use in nursing homes and long-term care settings,  		the lack of consistent definitions, terminology, item construction, sampling  		frames, and measurement criteria render it difficult to accurately gauge  		current HIT adoption. In this report, we review existing surveys for long-term  		care and other provider settings pertaining to current HIT use and adoption,  		barriers to adoption, and recommend issues to consider when developing survey  		questions to ascertain HIT adoption, use, and barriers to adoption and use in  		nursing homes.</p>
<p><a href="#intro">Section I</a> of the deliverable discusses current  		trends and policy initiatives in HIT for long-term care. <a href="#assess">Section II</a> summarizes several existing surveys on HIT use  		and adoption in long-term care settings, compares key findings of the surveys,  		and discusses measurement issues affecting survey results. Surveys used to  		assess HIT use and adoption in home health and hospice organizations,  		ambulatory or physician practices, and hospitals are discussed in  		<a href="#adopt">Section III</a> to determine if survey items and techniques  		from other settings could be used in long-term care. The descriptions of survey  		characteristics and findings were drawn from published papers or web-accessible  		information. The comparison of survey findings presented in <a href="#assess">Section II</a> and <a href="#adopt">Section III</a> highlights  		the assertion that lack of consistency with regard to data items and  		measurement methods hinders efforts to draw meaningful conclusions from  		published survey results.</p>
<p>Despite national support for widespread adoption of HIT across health  		care settings and growing recognition of its value in improving health care  		safety, quality, and efficiency, HIT adoption continues at a relatively slow  		pace. Recent efforts have been made to identify barriers contributing to the  		limited progress in HIT adoption and supply information to help guide the  		development of policies and incentives to promote more rapid HIT proliferation.  		In addition to the review of surveys on HIT adoption, we reviewed the  		literature on barriers to HIT adoption across provider settings. A brief  		synthesis of existing surveys and literature on barriers is found in  		<a href="#barrier">Section IV</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#recommend">Section V</a> provides recommendations for future  		survey development for long-term care. To reliably ascertain HIT adoption, use,  		and barriers in nursing homes, two sets of survey questions are recommended:  		(1) a shorter, core set of questions for possible use in the National Nursing  		Home Survey sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics; and (2) an  		expanded set of questions, which would be made available to industry  		stakeholder groups for survey administration. The creation of two sets of  		survey questions will provide both breadth and depth in the collection of  		information on the adoption of HIT applications in nursing homes. The core set  		of questions would provide an overview of HIT adoption that could be  		generalized to the industry as a whole. The expanded, longer set of questions  		keyed off of the core set of questions would provide in-depth, detailed data on  		the extent to which specific workflow and health information exchange processes  		are being adopted. Both sets of questions will provide valuable information to  		policy makers to assess movement toward the goal of promoting HIT adoption and  		make informed decisions about the policy actions that are needed to accelerate  		adoption. Our recommendations on the content and format for the survey  		questions will guide the remainder of this project.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Health information technology (HIT) in the United States is a broad term  		encompassing technology used for various administrative, operations management,  		and direct clinical functions in health care organizations. An electronic  		health record (EHR) is defined by the Health Information Management Systems  		Society (HIMSS) as a longitudinal electronic record of patient health  		information generated by one or more encounters in any health care  		settingincluding patient demographics, progress notes, problems,  		medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data,  		and radiology reports (HIMSS, 2007a). The Institute of Medicine (IoM)  		specifies that an EHR includes: (1) longitudinal collection of electronic  		health data for and about persons; (2) immediate access to health data  		pertaining to an individual by authorized users; (3) provision of knowledge and  		decision-support to enhance quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care;  		and (4) support of efficient processes for health care delivery. (IoM Committee  		on Data Standards for Patient Safety, 2003)</p>
<p>EHRs have the potential to improve quality, patient safety (particularly  		related to medication errors), and patient satisfaction and to decrease costs  		and inefficiencies by making current patient information and clinical decision  		making tools available to clinicians in a format which is easily readable (Booz  		Allen Hamilton, 2006; Shekelle, Morton, &amp; Keeler, 2006; Bates &amp;  		Gawande, 2003; Kaushal, Shojania, &amp; Bates, 2003; Bates, 2002). By  		minimizing the number of times that patient care information is re-entered into  		a health record, potential transcription errors and redundant procedures can be  		avoided (Coleman et al., 2007). Because of the potential improvements in  		clinical care and efficiency, the implementation of interoperable HIT became a  		national priority and President Bush established a goal that most Americans  		have an EHR by 2014. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  		Services (HHS) has made the promotion of interoperable HIT a priority and  		envisions Medicare will lead HIT implementation, and that Medicare and Medicaid  		will be transformed by HIT implementation. </p>
<p>The IoM has recommended that the U.S. health care system make a  		commitment to the development of a health information infrastructure by the  		year 2010 (IoM, 2003). The IoM identified the EHR functions and  		timeframes over which these functions could be introduced for particular health  		care settings. One of the settings for which the IoM described the needed  		EHR-System (EHR-S) functions was nursing homes. In late 2006, the Certification  		Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) was petitioned by  		long-term care stakeholder groups to include nursing homes in the development  		of accreditation criteria for EHR products.</p>
<p>Current work in this area has resulted in a profile of EHR-S functions  		for long-term care-nursing homes (the LTC-NH EHR-S Functional Profile),  		developed by a workgroup of long-term care industry stakeholders, including  		representatives from the American Association of Homes and Services for the  		Aging (AAHSA), the American Health Care Association (AHCA), and the National  		Association for the Support of Long Term Care, along with representatives from  		organizations involved in standards development for other providers, including  		the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), Health Level 7  		(HL7), and the National Council on Prescription Drug Programs. The LTC-NH EHR-S  		Functional Profile has been submitted to CCHIT and HL7. HL7 will ballot the  		Profile in December 2008, and it is expected to become the industry standard in  		January 2009. CCHIT will consider the LTC-NH EHR-S Function Profile in the  		specification of nursing home EHR certification criteria. It is anticipated  		that CCHIT will begin certifying LTC-NH EHR products in 2009-2010 (AHIMA,  		2007a, 2007b). </p>
<p>The LTC HIT Summit, held first in 2005 and again in 2007, is a  		collaborative effort by long-term care and aging services stakeholders to  		assess current progress in the area of HIT adoption by long-term care providers  		and to identify future priorities. Stakeholders include the groups named above,  		as well as governmental and consumer representatives, and IT product vendors.  		The result of the 2005 LTC HIT Summit was a road map for promoting the use of  		HIT in delivery of services to the elderly. The themes of the roadmap include  		certification, standards, quality, and areas for research. The 2007-2009 LTC  		HIT Road Map produced by the 2007 Summit includes recommendations to: (a)  		strengthen the cross-organizational collaborative of long-term care  		stakeholders; (b) increase the consumer-focused approach to quality initiatives  		and HIT applications; (c) advocate for tools to support providers in HIT  		adoption; (d) prioritize electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) of medications  		and medication management initiatives to improve patient safety; (e) certify  		EHR and e-prescribing products; (f) demonstrate interoperability of HIT through  		emerging standards; and (g) encourage further research investigating  		relationships between HIT, quality, and outcomes across the full spectrum of  		aging services and care (AHIMA, 2007a).</p>
<p>Despite the potential of HIT and EHRs to improve quality and efficiency,  		and current initiatives to improve quality of products through certification  		and interoperability through standards development, current estimated rates of  		adoption vary across provider settings and some estimates suggest that adoption  		rates are relatively low in nursing facilities, particularly in terms of use of  		non-administrative HIT applications. Slow HIT/EHR adoption rates have been  		attributed to several factors, including the costs of acquiring, implementing,  		and maintaining HIT/EHR applications; uncertainty about the benefits that may  		be realized as a result of EHR implementation and to whom these benefits will  		accrue; delay in adoption of standards for HIT functionality and  		interoperability; and a history of instability in the vendor market (Booz Allen  		Hamilton, 2006; Poon et al., 2006; Middleton, Hammond, Brennan, &amp; Cooper,  		2005). </p>
<p>A number of survey instruments have been developed to assess HIT/EHR  		adoption in various provider settings. In addition, several nursing  		home-specific surveys have incorporated questions about the adoption of  		HIT/EHR, including the National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) sponsored by the  		National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). However, to date most surveys  		have used varying definitions of HIT/EHR, if the terms are defined at all,  		making national adoption rates difficult to estimate (Robert Wood Johnson  		Foundation (RWJF), 2006). In addition, some current surveys designed to assess  		nursing home HIT/EHR adoption (e.g., a California HealthCare Foundation study  		on long-term care provider readiness, a Minnesota Department of Health/Stratis  		Health survey on use and intended use of EHRs for health care providers in  		Minnesota), are state-specific and may not be generalizable to the national  		nursing home community. Without reliable and valid data on HIT adoption rates  		by provider type and the factors that contribute to slow adoption, policy  		makers will not have an accurate baseline that can be used to assess movement  		toward the goal of promoting EHR adoption and are less able to make informed  		decisions about the policy actions that are needed to accelerate adoption. </p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		in HHS has funded the University of Colorado Denver to develop a survey  		instrument that contains a: (i) comprehensive; and (ii) more narrow set of  		questions that could be used to measure the adoption and use, and barriers to  		adoption and use of HIT, including EHRs, by nursing home providers. In this  		report, we review existing surveys for long-term care and other provider  		settings, and recommend issues to consider and next steps for the development  		of: (a) a core set of questions that could be included in the NNHS; and (b) an  		expanded set of questions to ascertain adoption, use, and barriers to adoption  		and use of HIT/EHR in nursing homes. HIT-related questions from several key  		federal and other surveys discussed in this report are presented in  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="assess" id="assess">II. SURVEYS ASSESSING HIT USE IN NURSING HOMES AND  		OTHER LONG-TERM CARE SETTINGS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
<p>Several surveys assessing HIT use in nursing homes and other long-term  		care settings have been conducted over the past several years. However,  		significant variability in breadth and depth of survey content, data item  		construction, terminology, and definitions (when definitions are provided at  		all), as well as issues of sample size and representativeness, make it  		difficult to rely on the accuracy of estimates produced by the surveys. These  		issues also limit the ability to compare findings on the use of various  		electronic clinical applications across surveys. Additionally, many of the  		existing surveys included respondents from a single state (California, New  		York, Minnesota), limiting the generalizability of findings to the national  		picture. Not surprisingly, the estimates resulting from the existing surveys  		vary widely, underscoring the likelihood of reliability and validity issues  		affecting some findings and making it difficult to discern which estimates are  		most representative. Findings from seven surveys addressing HIT adoption and  		use in nursing homes and other long-term care settings are presented in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. <a href="#sectionII.B">Section II.B</a> provides  		further description of survey content, measurement approach, and related  		information for each survey included in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> and three  		additional surveys that have not been fielded extensively to date (and  		therefore do not have findings to compare). </p>
<h3><a name="sectionII.B" id="sectionII.B">B. Summaries of Existing Nursing  		Home and Long-Term Care Surveys</a></h3>
<p><b><i>National Nursing Home Survey</i></b></p>
<p>The NNHS is a survey of a nationally representative sample of nursing  		homes in the United States (NCHS, 2004; NCHS, 2007c,  		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nnhs.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nnhs.htm</a>).  		Conducted by NCHS at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the  		NNHS was first implemented in 1973 and repeated six times, most recently in  		2004. To participate in the NNHS, nursing homes must have at least three beds  		and be certified by Medicare or Medicaid or have a state license to operate as  		a nursing home. Responses to the NNHS are obtained through interviews with  		facility administrators and designated staff, using a computer-assisted  		personal interviewing system. In 2004, 1,174 nursing homes responded to the  		NNHS survey, which had been re-designed and expanded to collect many new data  		items. One of the new items obtains information on use of Electronic  		Information Systems (EIS), as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>Admission, Discharge, Transfer Information Physician Orders  			 Medication Orders, Drug Dispensing Laboratory/Procedures Information  			 Patient Medical Records Medication Administration Information  			 Minimum Data Set (MDS)<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup>Dietary Daily Personal Care by Nursing  			 Assistants Billing/Finance Staffing/Scheduling Information Human  			 Resource/Personnel Information No Electronic Information System  			 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a separate Help Screen for this item, "Patient Medical Records" is  		defined to include nurse's notes, physician notes, and MDS forms. The NNHS  		survey also collects information on nursing home characteristics including  		size, location, chain affiliation, ownership, Medicare/Medicaid certification,  		services provided and specialty programs offered, and charges.</p>
<p>Nursing home respondents participating in the 2004 NNHS reported using  		EIS as follows: </p>
<ul><li>95% use EIS for billing/finance;</li>
<li>48% use EIS for physician orders; </li>
<li>51% use EIS for medication orders and drug dispensing;</li>
<li>38% use EIS for medication administration information; and</li>
<li>42% use EIS for patient medical records.</li>
</ul><p>Lack of clarity in the EIS item stem and list of tasks may affect the  		reliability and validity of survey findings for this item. "EIS" is not  		defined, resulting in possible variability in interpretation by respondents. In  		addition, response options (or, the list of tasks) include overlapping  		concepts; for example, the distinction between "drug dispensing" and  		"medication administration information" is not clear, although the two  		applications are included in separately listed tasks. Also, "patient medical  		records" is defined to include MDS forms yet MDS is a separate task or response  		option. With regard to facility characteristics, it would be useful to  		distinguish between regional chain affiliation and national chain affiliation.  		NCHS staff agree that the EIS question requires clarification, including a  		focus on adoption and use of clearly defined EHR functions.</p>
<p><b><i>AHCA/NCAL Study on HIT Use in LTC </i></b></p>
<p>A 2006 paper by AHCA and the National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL)  		entitled, A Snap-Shot of the Use of Health Information Technology in Long  		Term Care reports on findings from a web-based survey developed and  		fielded in 2006 (AHCA and NCAL, 2006,  		<a href="http://www.ahcancal.org/facility_operations/hit/Documents/HITWhitePaper.pdf">http://www.ahcancal.org/facility_operations/hit/Documents/HITWhitePaper.pdf</a>).  		The survey describes six personas of HIT usage and asks respondents  		to identify the persona that best describes their current level of HIT usage  		and what they think usage might be in three years. The personas are summarized  		as follows: A - We do most of our work on paper; B - We are starting to do more  		of our work on a computer; C - We do most of our work on computer; D - We are  		paperless -- we do all of our work on a computer; E - We are paperless and  		communicate electronically with some of our health care partners; and F - We  		are paperless and we communicate electronically with all of our health care  		partners through a national or regional health information network. Explicit  		examples for each persona are provided for further clarification, as  		illustrated by the full descriptions for personas A and D:</p>
<p>Persona A: We do most of our work on paper, meaning</p>
<ul><li>
<p>We have a few desktop computers that we use for census, billing, and  			 (as appropriate) MDS and/or service plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we communicate with our physicians, hospitals, pharmacy, lab,  			 and insurance companies via telephone, paper, and fax.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Persona D: We are paperless -- we do all of our work on a computer,  		meaning</p>
<ul><li>
<p>We have desktop computers and/or portable computers for traditional  			 activities: census, progress notes, billing, and (as appropriate) MDS and  			 service plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use our computers at the point of care to document our work with  			 residents, plus we are also electronically charting and recording medication  			 delivery with an electronic medication administration record (e-MAR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we communicate with our physicians, hospitals, pharmacy, lab,  			 and insurance companies via telephone, paper, and fax.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Interestingly, even Persona A, representing the lowest level of HIT use,  		includes use of computers for census, billing, MDS, and/or service plans. </p>
<p>A total of 1,082 surveys were completed, including 916 nursing  		facilities and 166 assisted living residences. A single national multi-facility  		company (Golden Gate National Senior Care) owned and operated 345 responding  		nursing facilities and 18 responding assisted living residences, representing  		one-third of all responses. Golden Gate assigned all of their  		facilities/residences to Persona C, described as "We do most of our work on  		computer". </p>
<p>Findings from the 916 nursing facility respondents from 40 states  		include:</p>
<ul><li>4% (34 facilities) reported being paperless, characterizing  		  themselves at the three Personas with the highest level of HIT use (Personas D,  		  E, F), with four of those facilities (less than 1% of the sample) indicating  		  that they communicate electronically with all health care partners through a  		  national or regional information network;</li>
<li>50% (including Golden Gate National Senior Care) indicated that they  		  do most of their work using computers (Persona C); and</li>
<li>46% indicated that they do most of their work on paper or are just  		  starting to do more work on a computer -- the two Personas (A and B) with the  		  lowest level of HIT use.</li>
</ul><p>Additional study findings include:</p>
<ul><li>National multi-facility provider organizations (i.e., those with 50  		  or more facilities in multiple states) are leading in HIT use, will continue to  		  lead the HIT transition and, in three years, are expected to be "highly  		  sophisticated in their use of HIT";</li>
<li>independent providers (comprised of ten facilities or less) and  		  regional multi-facility companies (with 11-50 individual facilities in one or  		  more states) may be further behind in transitioning to HIT; </li>
<li>most nursing homes report using information technology for various  		  administrative activities (e.g., census, billing, MDS production), although the  		  vast majority still handle health information exchange (e.g., with physicians,  		  hospitals, etc.) via telephone, paper, and fax;</li>
<li>the lack of available capital will make it harder for smaller  		  provider organizations to acquire and maintain HIT than large national  		  providers; </li>
<li>concern exists regarding software integration and finding a single,  		  interoperable package that matches facility needs; and </li>
<li>most nursing homes reported that their use of computers would  		  increase over the next three years.</li>
</ul><p>Although the use of Personas provides a sense of the comparative degree  		of HIT usage among responding providers, it is difficult to winnow out precise  		estimates on the use of particular HIT functionalities and applications using  		this measurement approach. The explicit descriptions supplied in the Personas  		are useful, however, in guiding respondents as they characterize their  		organizations implementation status.</p>
<p><b><i>Maestro Strategies: AHCA Multi-Facility Organization  		Survey</i></b></p>
<p>Maestro Strategies' 2007 report entitled, Information Technology  		in Long Term Care -- State of the Industry: Multi-Facility Research  		Report describes the results from a web-based survey of 36 AHCA  		multi-facility members (19% response rate) addressing the current state of  		information technology use in long-term care, conducted on behalf of AHCA and  		NCAL. The respondents represented primarily for-profit organizations that owned  		skilled nursing facilities (SNF), rehabilitation, assisted living, short stay  		respite care and other program and facility types. Nearly half of the survey  		respondents were organization Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) (41%), with most  		other respondents identified as Information Technology Directors, Chief  		Information Officers (CIOs), and Chief Operating Officers (Maestro Strategies,  		2007,  		<a href="http://www.ahcancal.org/facility_operations/hit/Documents/InformationTechnologyinLongTermCare.pdf">http://www.ahcancal.org/facility_operations/hit/Documents/InformationTechnologyinLongTermCare.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>The report provides information on the HIT applications that responding  		facilities have installed and own, the applications they are planning to buy,  		and the applications they are not planning to buy. With regard to clinical  		applications, the authors report that MDS, care and service plans, and  		assessments are the most frequently implemented applications (about 90%, 75%,  		and 70%, respectively). EHR/Electronic Medical Record (EMR), e-prescribing, and  		e-MAR/electronic treatment administration records (e-TAR) are the top planned  		purchases. Approximate estimates for selected applications are shown below:</p>
<ul><li>18% of respondents had installed an "EHR/EMR";</li>
<li>50% had installed automated "Medical Records";</li>
<li>50% had automated outcome measurement, quality management, and case  		  management applications;</li>
<li>40% had automated physician order entry/order processing; and</li>
<li>20% had installed e-MAR/e-TAR systems.</li>
</ul><p>The distinction between "EHR/EMR" and "Medical Records" is unclear (data  		items are not included in the report), and the survey estimates for current use  		of these two applications vary considerably.</p>
<p>The report also presents survey findings on the use of electronic  		applications for financial planning; resident services (e.g., resident billing,  		care and service plans, resident admissions and census management); and  		facilities (e.g., preventive maintenance management, construction projects).  		The survey also addressed currently used software vendors; use of  		emerging technologies (e.g., wireless computing, web-based services  		and forms, personal digital assistants (PDAs)); perceived EMR readiness;  		challenges with information technology; percentage of operating budget and  		percentage of capital budget spent on information technology; and planned  		changes in information technology spending. Finally, the survey included items  		on information technology operations and management approaches; the level of  		integration of financial, clinical, therapy, pharmacy, and supply applications;  		number of computers or workstations per facility; and extent of connectivity  		within organizations and with outside facilities. </p>
<p>While the survey assesses many areas of interest, the small sample size  		limits the generalizability of findings and the lack of clear definitions for  		certain clinical applications may affect the validity and reliability of  		estimates.</p>
<p><b><i>Kaushal et al.: Expert Panel Estimates</i></b></p>
<p>Kaushal et al. relied on expert opinion to generate estimates of current  		and future HIT adoption rates for several health care provider types, including  		SNFs (Kaushal et al., 2005a, 2005b; Poon et al., 2006). The expert panel  		estimated EHR use as part of an effort to develop a model national health  		information network that could be attained in five years considering current  		financial, personnel, and technical constraints. Using information from  		stakeholder interviews conducted with 52 representatives of a variety of health  		care settings in Denver and Boston -- including five from SNF/rehabilitation  		hospitals -- and their own estimates, the expert panel estimated that  		approximately 80% of SNFs now have an electronic billing/claims system and in  		five years almost 100% will have them. In addition, the panel estimated current  		use of EHRs in approximately 1% of SNFs and predicted an increase to 14% in  		five years. For home health agencies (HHAs), 5% were estimated to have EHRs  		now, with an increase to 21% in five years.</p>
<p>The authors of this study did not define (for purposes of the study)  		what was meant by the concept of EHRs. In addition, the SNF EHR estimates were  		constructed based on expert opinion guided by data from a small sample of  		stakeholder interviews that included only five SNF/rehabilitation hospital  		representatives, and are considerably lower than findings resulting from data  		collected in other surveys.</p>
<p><b><i>California HealthCare Foundation</i></b></p>
<p>As reported in "Health Information Technology: Are Long-Term Care  		Providers Ready?" the California HealthCare Foundation supported a survey,  		focus groups, and interviews to examine HIT readiness in Californias  		SNFs, residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFEs), and community-based  		service providers. The survey was conducted in 2006 in collaboration with the  		California Association of Health Facilities and Aging Services of California  		and was distributed electronically to a non-random sample of members who were  		decision makers for HIT (administrators, clinical leaders, and information  		technology personnel) from a SNF or assisted living facility with more than 75  		beds and considering HIT purchase (Hudak and Sharkey, 2007,  		<a href="http://www.chcf.org/document/chronicdisease/HITNursingHomeReadiness.pdf">http://www.chcf.org/document/chronicdisease/HITNursingHomeReadiness.pdf</a>).  		</p>
<p>The survey yielded responses from 80 SNFs (47% response rate), including  		39 that were part of multi-facility organizations, 34 freestanding facilities,  		and seven hospital-based facilities, with 71% of all respondents characterizing  		their organizations as for-profit. In addition, 18 assisted living facilities  		or RCFEs with more than 75 beds responded, all non-profit (24% response rate).  		Five continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) also responded.</p>
<p>The authors highlight the following survey findings:</p>
<ul><li>97% of nursing homes use business or administrative functions to meet  		  state or federal payment and certification requirements;</li>
<li>20% of all respondents reported using clinical HIT applications  		  (e.g., assessments, progress notes, medication and treatment administration,  		  care planning; e-prescribing; and decision-support tools); </li>
<li>21% of nursing homes reported using clinical charting applications;  		  and</li>
<li>18% of nursing homes reported using medication administration  		  applications. </li>
</ul><p>The report also describes survey findings on HIT Implementation  		Progress, noting that 72% of the seven responding hospital-affiliated  		SNFs indicated some level of HIT implementation (fully, partially, or in  		progress) compared to 14% that reported that their HIT system was being  		developed, 14% indicating they were in the planning stage with a timeline  		established, and none indicating they had not started. Forty-six percent of the  		39 multi-facility SNFs reported some level of implementation, 5% were in the  		system selection stage, 14% were in the planning stage with a timeline  		established, 35% were gathering information, and none indicated they had not  		started. Among the 34 freestanding SNFs, 25% reported some level of  		implementation, 11% indicated a system was being developed, 7% were in the  		system selection stage, 7% were in the planning stage with a timeline  		established, 32% were gathering information, and 18% had not started.</p>
<p>The report authors conclude that: (a) long-term care facilities in  		California use HIT primarily to meet state or federal requirements; (b)  		clinical HIT applications are only minimally used; (c) HIT systems are not  		integrated and often require greater staff time than paper-based processes; and  		(d) HIT systems are underused, often because they are too complex for staff or  		cannot easily be customized to meet unique provider needs. </p>
<p>The authors suggest that HIT readiness is relatively low in the  		long-term care community due to lack of knowledge or background with regard to  		vendor selection and/or HIT implementation, including fear of the technology;  		lack of strategic planning and goals; the underestimation of necessary  		long-term management changes; and the undervaluation of the benefits of HIT in  		long-term quality improvement. </p>
<p>Generalizability of the survey findings is limited by the non-random  		selection of survey respondents in a single state who met the requirement of  		being with a facility considering HIT purchase or gathering information.</p>
<p><b><i>Continuing Care Leadership Coalition Study</i></b></p>
<p>The Continuing Care Leadership Coalition (CCLC), a coalition of  		approximately 100 non-profit and public long-term care providers in the  		metropolitan New York area, conducted a survey in 2006 to gather baseline  		information regarding their members adoption of HIT (CCLC, 2006,  		<a href="http://www.cclcny.org/documents/2006HITsurvey.pdf">http://www.cclcny.org/documents/2006HITsurvey.pdf</a>).  		Thirty-four organizations responded to the survey, for a 55% response rate.  		Twelve responding organizations were freestanding nursing facilities and 22  		were multi-service long-term care organizations. The multi-service  		organizations (MSOs) included at least two of the following: nursing  		facilities, certified home health care agencies, long-term home health care  		programs, licensed home health care programs, medical model adult day health  		care programs, managed long-term care programs, senior housing, and other  		community-based services (e.g., diagnostic and treatment centers, hospices,  		social model adult day health care programs). The 34 survey respondents  		represented 70 separate entities, specifically 38 nursing facilities and 32  		home and community-based service (HCBS) programs. No information was provided  		regarding the type of staff responding to the survey.</p>
<p>The survey included items on organizational investment in HIT, including  		the number of staff dedicated to HIT responsibilities, the level of outsourcing  		of HIT functions, percentage of overall budget allocated to information  		technology, annual information technology budget for particular categories, and  		expected capital information technology budget for 2007, as well as a question  		on whether the organization has developed its own proprietary software to solve  		problems and in what categories (e.g., comprehensive financial and clinical  		systems).</p>
<p>The survey also addressed HIT priorities, including the top three  		information technology priorities for the next two years. Nearly 70% of  		respondents indicated that implementing an EMR system was their top HIT  		priority, followed by replacing or upgrading clinical systems (58.8% of  		respondents), reducing medical errors/promoting patient safety (50%),  		developing a clinical data exchange with outside entities (47.1%), upgrading  		network infrastructure (32.4%), establishing wireless capabilities (23.5%),  		developing security initiatives (20.6%), and creating data repositories  		(14.7%). </p>
<p>Barriers to HIT adoption and the organization's greatest technical  		challenges with regard to information technology networks and infrastructure  		also were assessed. Cost was identified as the top barrier to HIT adoption,  		with approximately 90% of respondents indicating initial cost of information  		technology investment as a significant barrier (48.5%) or somewhat of a barrier  		(42.4%). Additional findings on barriers to adopting HIT are presented in  		<a href="#table8">Table 8</a> in <a href="#barrier">Section IV</a> of this  		report. <a href="#barrier">Section IV</a> also presents discussion comparing  		findings on barriers across multiple surveys. </p>
<p>Financial considerations were identified by 62% of respondents as one of  		the greatest challenges with regard to information technology networks and  		infrastructure, followed by integration of services, data center redundancy,  		network security, authentication/single sign-on, and other. </p>
<p>Survey respondents indicated the operational status for electronic  		billing and specified clinical information systems, with the following response  		options: Fully operational, Partially operational, Plan to implement within two  		years, No plans to implement. Respondents indicated the vendor, specific  		application, years used, and satisfaction with the system they are using. </p>
<p>The report presented the following findings on billing and clinical  		information systems, based on responses from 38 nursing facilities (both  		freestanding and part of MSOs):</p>
<ul><li>87% indicated that they had a fully operational electronic billing  		  system;</li>
<li>8% had a fully operational CPOE system, 8% had a partially  		  operational CPOE system, 21% indicated plans to implement CPOE within two  		  years, and 26% had no plans to implement;</li>
<li>66% cited a fully operational Admission, Discharge, Transfer (ADT)  		  System, none had a partially operational ADT system, 21% planned to implement  		  within two years, and 3% had no plans to implement; and</li>
<li>8% reported a fully operational e-prescribing system, with 5%  		  partially operational, 29% planning to implement within two years, and 42% with  		  no plans to implement.</li>
</ul><p>Additional findings on use of electronic systems (without indication of  		degree of implementation) included e-documentation (24%), care planning (42%),  		assessments (45%), physician support (11%), workflow (16%), medication  		administration (21%), and MDS/Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)  		(71%). </p>
<p>Of the 32 responding HCBS programs, 75% reported a fully operational  		billing system. Thirteen percent indicated they had a fully operational CPOE,  		and 9% were partially operational. Seventy-five percent of HCBS programs  		reported a fully operational ADT System and 6% reported a partially operational  		system. Three percent (one program) reported a fully operational e-prescribing  		system, 3% had a partially operational e-prescribing system, 9% (three  		programs) planned to implement within two years, and 41% had no plans to  		implement. (Forty-four percent of HCBS programs did not provide information on  		CPOE or e-prescribing.) </p>
<p>An item assessing EMR implementation reads: "Please indicate below the  		status of EMR implementation in your organization. <i>(For this purpose, the  		EMR is defined as electronically originated and maintained clinical health  		information, derived from multiple sources, that replaces the paper record as  		the primary source of patient information.) </i>Response options were:  		Fully operational, Partially operational, Developing plans to implement, No  		current plans to implement. The following findings on the status of EMR  		implementation are reported for the 12 nursing facilities and 22 MSOs, without  		separating out the nursing facilities and HCBS programs within the MSOs:</p>
<ul><li>Two (about 6%) of the 34 organizations reported a fully operational  		  EMR system;</li>
<li>23.5% reported a partially operational EMR; </li>
<li>41.2% were developing plans to implement; and</li>
<li>approximately 30% indicated they had no current plans to implement an  		  EMR.</li>
</ul><p>MSOs appeared to be somewhat more progressive in implementing EMRs as  		compared to freestanding nursing facilities, as none of the 12 freestanding  		nursing facilities indicated they had a fully operational EMR, one indicated a  		partially operational EMR, four were developing plans to implement, and seven  		had no current plans to implement.</p>
<p>Fifteen percent of respondents (both nursing facilities and MSOs)  		indicated involvement in a regional health information organization (RHIO); and  		almost 40% noted participation in collaborative information technology projects  		with other health care providers or entities, such as clinical data exchanges  		with hospitals or physician groups.</p>
<p>The survey also asked how the organization receives hospital discharge  		data (Fax, Telephone, or Electronically) and how the organization provides  		clinical information to hospitals or other health care entities (Fax, Send  		chart with patient, Electronically, or Telephone). </p>
<p>Survey results are limited to New York State, with the survey  		respondents noted to capture 14% of all nursing home beds in the state, and  		approximately 30% of all home health care patients.</p>
<p><b><i>Stratis Health </i></b></p>
<p>Stratis Health conducted a survey of Minnesota nursing homes under  		contract with the Minnesota Department of Health with the goal of obtaining  		information to help understand the use or intended use of EHRs for health  		care providers in Minnesota. As reported in Minnesota Nursing Home  		Health Information Technology Survey: Survey Results (Stratis Health,  		2008), 297 nursing homes responded to the survey, for a 78.2% response rate.  		</p>
<p>Participating nursing homes indicated whether they were part of a  		national or regional chain; freestanding or hospital-based; and for-profit or  		non-profit. The survey obtained information on the current use of  		software/technology for the following HIT systems and the survey  		results (if available) are indicated in parentheses.</p>
<ul><li>Entry and submission of the MDS;</li>
<li>Census management system (83.2%);</li>
<li>Resident assessment and care planning (84.5%);</li>
<li>Documentation of clinical notes (41.4%);</li>
<li>Receiving external clinical documents (20.9%);</li>
<li>Decision-support tools (23.2%);</li>
<li>Completing the medication administration record (MAR) (49.0%);  		  and</li>
<li>E-prescribing between practitioner and pharmacies (1.7%).</li>
</ul><p>Each application is explicitly defined in the item. For example, the MAR  		item reads: Does your facility currently use software/technology to  		complete the medication administration record (MAR)? (All medications  		administered to patients are recorded into the MAR and generated from the  		medication list. May allow provider to view recent lab results and patient  		allergies. Interfaces with pharmacy system, computerized order entry system,  		and patient tracking (admission-discharge-transfer) system." Response options  		for each item were:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 - We have this technology and are currently using it. 2 - We  		  have this technology but are not using it. 3 - We plan to obtain this  		  technology in the next 12-24 months. 4 - We do not have current plans to  		  obtain this technology, but would like to do so at some point in the future.  		  5 - We have explored this technology and have no desire to obtain it. 6  		  - We have not looked into obtaining this technology.</p>
<p>If 1, To what extent does your facility use the MAR software?  		  (Extensively, Moderately, Rarely).</p>
<p>Is the data collected by the software used to complete the MAR  		  transferred electronically either inside your facility or outside your  		  facility?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The item on documentation of clinical notes also asked respondents to  		select where documentation of clinical notes occurs: hand-held devices such as  		PDAs; kiosks located outside patient rooms; laptop; computers located at  		bedside; voice-activated dictaphones for later transcription; or other.  		Respondents also were asked when does documentation of clinical notes occur:  		after each encounter; after multiple encounters, or other? </p>
<p>Survey respondent were also asked to complete the following  		questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Does your facility have an EHR or a paperless system? (A  			 longitudinal electronic record of patient health information generated by one  			 or more encounters in any care delivery setting? (Yes, No)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you describe your facilitys EHR implementation  			 status?</p>
<ul><li>Fully-implemented -- Facility is fully or partially using;</li>
<li>Fully-implemented -- Facility is not using;</li>
<li>Partially-implemented, Development stage of EHR-S;</li>
<li>Selection stage of EHR-S;</li>
<li>Planning stage of EHR-S;</li>
<li>Information gathering stage; and</li>
<li>Have not started, or no plans for implementation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Survey findings indicate that almost 32% of responding nursing homes  		described their EHR implementation status as fully-implemented or  		partially-implemented. </p>
<p>The survey also included an item identifying barriers "that may have  		slowed or prevented implementation and/or use of software/technology in your  		facility," using the scale options of Major barrier, Minor barrier, or Not a  		barrier. The list of barriers respondents were asked to consider is presented  		in <a href="#table8">Table 8</a> in <a href="#barrier">Section IV</a> in this  		report. Lack of capital resources to invest was supported by 72.1% of  		respondents as a major barrier, as reported in the survey (Stratis Health,  		2008). </p>
<p>Survey results are limited to Minnesota. The inclusion of specific  		description of HIT applications in the data items estimating use (as noted for  		the MAR above) likely promotes valid and reliable findings for those items.</p>
<p><b><i>ASPE Taxonomy of HIT Application Features for Nursing  		Homes</i></b></p>
<p>Work recently completed under another ASPE-funded project entitled  		"Understanding Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology in Nursing  		Homes and Home Health Agencies", conducted by the University of Colorado  		Denver, produced a Draft Taxonomy of HIT Application Features for Nursing  		Homes. As part of the developmental process, representatives from nine nursing  		homes were invited to provide information requested in the taxonomy, and to  		comment on the taxonomys accuracy and comprehensiveness in reflecting HIT  		use in nursing homes. (A similar taxonomy was developed for home health  		providers, as described later in this document.) </p>
<p>The draft nursing home taxonomy includes five domains: Administration,  		Operations Management, EHR/EMR; Medications; and Telemedicine/Telehealth. For  		each domain, respondents are asked to list the product(s) their organization  		uses for any of the domain functions, including the product name and year  		implemented. Multiple application features are listed within each of the five  		domains, with a definition provided for each feature. For example, Census  		Management, listed under the Administration domain, is defined as follows:  		Pre-admission/referrals, admissions, discharges, transfers, leave of  		absences, bed holds, census verification, current list of residents, available  		beds, admission/discharge/transfer/leave reporting. For each application  		feature listed, respondents address the following five areas:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Products that support this feature (from the product list provided  			 for the domain as a whole). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this product interface with other products in or outside of  			 your facility? (Y/N) If Yes, what?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current or Planned Usage -- responses include:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 - We have this application and are currently using it. 2 -  				We have this application but are not using it. 3 - We plan to purchase this  				application in the next 12-24 months. 4 - We do not have current plans to  				purchase this application, but would like to do so at some point in the future.  				5 - We do not have this application and have no desire to obtain  				it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of Employees, Disciplines using this application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extent of Use -- responses include:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 - This application is fully-implemented and all appropriate  				staff are using it. 2 - This application has been partially-implemented and  				in use by at least 50% of staff for whom the application is targeted. 3 -  				This application has been partially-implemented but in use by less than 50% of  				staff for whom the application is targeted. 4 - This application has been  				purchased and staff training has been (or will be) scheduled. 5 - This  				application has been purchased but we do not plan to use it at this time.  				</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol><p>The taxonomy and findings from the review and submission of information  		on HIT functions by five responding nursing homes can be found in  		Taxonomy of Health Information Technology in Nursing Homes -- Report B:  		Review by Representatives from Nursing Homes and Vendors submitted to  		ASPE in August 2007 (University of Colorado Denver, 2007a), and is available at  		the following link:  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2007/Taxonomy-NH.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2007/Taxonomy-NH.htm</a>.  		The taxonomy was used to identify nursing home providers for a qualitative case  		study evaluation of costs and benefits of implementing certain HIT  		functions.</p>
<p>With its comprehensive content, explicitly defined applications for each  		functionality promoting reliability and validity, and foundation in a rigorous  		developmental and review process, the Draft Nursing Home Taxonomy, in  		combination with selected features from other existing survey instruments, can  		serve as a useful resource when developing effective items for assessing  		adoption and use of HIT applications in nursing homes.</p>
<p><b><i>National Survey of Residential Care Facilities (NSRCF)</i></b></p>
<p>The National Survey of Residential Care Facilities (NSRCF) is a new  		survey developed by the NCHS in collaboration with ASPE (NCHS, 2008c,  		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhcs/nhcs_datacollection.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhcs/nhcs_datacollection.htm</a>). NCHS expects  		to nationally field the NSRCF beginning in February 2009, after pilot and  		pre-testing has been completed. The NSRCF Facility Questionnaire contains three  		items addressing EIS, as listed below.</p>
<blockquote><p> Other than for accounting purposes, does this facility have a  		  computerized system for resident service records? For example, an Electronic  		  Medical Records System. (Yes/No)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents who answer yes to the above question also complete the  		following questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Physicians; Nursing homes; Hospitals; Pharmacies;  			 Other health or long-term care providers; Residents personal  			 health record; Corporate office; and Electronic information is NOT  			 exchanged.</p>

<p><b><i>University of Pittsburgh Study on Availability and Use of HIT in  		Nursing Homes</i></b></p>
<p>A study currently underway at the University of Pittsburgh (Degenholtz,  		2007) is examining the availability and use of HIT in nursing homes, with a  		focus on identifying clinical care processes that benefit particularly from  		HIT, reviewing currently available HIT software designed for nursing home use,  		and conducting a survey of multiple nursing home representatives (including  		administrators, directors of nursing, physicians, consultant pharmacists, and  		advance practice nurses) to estimate the actual use of HIT functions that have  		been implemented in nursing homes. A key objective of the study is to examine  		the differences between the routine work of nursing home staff and clinical  		providers and the features offered in HIT applications marketed to nursing  		homes. </p>
<h3>C. Comparison of Selected Findings on HIT Use in Nursing  		Homes/Long-Term Care and Discussion of Measurement Issues</h3>
<p>Despite the number of estimates related to HIT use in long-term care  		that have been produced, the noted lack of consistency in types of applications  		covered in the surveys, terminology, definitions, and measurement approaches  		limits the capacity to make direct comparisons to only a small subset of  		estimates for particular applications. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>,  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> present the  		estimates for use of EMRs/EHRs, CPOE, and medication administration systems  		from surveys where terminology was similar enough to reasonably compare. (The  		information in the tables is drawn from <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> above,  		but focuses on the single application estimates.) </p>
<p>As highlighted in the tables, the estimates are generally inconsistent.  		Much of this inconsistency likely derives from survey respondents varying  		interpretations of whether the applications in use at their facilities meet the  		definitions of those being measured by the survey. Some respondents may tend to  		be more expansive in their interpretation, while some may have a very  		constricted view of the criteria that must be met to label an application as an  		EMR, EHR, CPOE, or automated MAR system. This range of interpretation clearly  		is even wider for surveys that do not provide definitions or explicit  		descriptions to guide respondents.</p>
<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> shows that estimates for EMR/EHR use  		ranged from 18% to 47% (setting aside the Maestro Strategies estimate of 50%  		use of automated medical records as a separate category from EHR/EMR), with  		limited consistency across the five surveys. The use of EMR/EHR systems is  		higher in the NNHS findings at 47% compared to about 29% for the CCLC survey,  		and approximately 17% and 18% in the Stratis Health and Maestro Strategies  		surveys, respectively, with the Kaushal et al. estimate at a notably lower 1%.  		The variability in estimates is at least partly attributable to the lack of  		consistent, clear description of what the surveys are measuring. The lack of  		universal agreement on the definition of EHR in general (Jha et al., 2006)  		compounds the complexity of measuring use. Respondents may not share the same  		view of what constitutes an EMR or EHR and whether their facilitys system  		does or does not meet the definition they have in mind. Estimates resulting  		from surveys that simply use the terms EMR or EHR without providing further  		explanation suffer from personal biases, lack of agreement, and unclear and  		inconsistent understanding among respondents. The surveys that do provide  		definitions, explanations, or examples improve the likelihood of producing  		accurate results within the survey, although cross-survey consistency in  		definitions and measurement approaches remains limited. Among the reviewed set  		of surveys, the 47% estimate from the NNHS referred to use of EIS for Patient  		Medical Records, with a Help Screen that notes the records to include  		nurses notes, physician notes, and MDS forms, a rather broad definition  		that does not use the term EMR or EHR. Stratis Healths survey, which  		found a 32% estimate of Minnesota nursing homes with fully or partially  		implement EHR systems, refers to a paperless EHR-S without defining  		the components of the EHR. The 29% estimate produced by the CCLC survey may be  		closer to an accurate representation for their respondent population due to  		their more explicit definition (although the phrase clinical health  		information still may leave for variable respondent interpretation). </p>
<p>As displayed in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, the NNHS estimate for  		computerized or electronic physician order entry systems (48%) is similar to  		the Maestro Strategies finding (40%), with the CCLC survey yielding a  		substantially lower 16% estimate. While CPOE may be among the more commonly  		recognized electronic applications, the operationalization of such a system may  		differ from organization to organization, with many gradations of use still  		appropriately described as CPOE (termed variably as computerized physician  		order entry or computerized provider order entry). For example, a nursing home  		may routinely and reliably use a CPOE system under which physicians call or fax  		orders to a nurse or other staff member at the facility, who then enters the  		order into the computerized system. At other facilities, it may be that the  		physician always enters orders directly into the computer, perhaps guided by an  		automated dropdown list. Other facilities may operate with a combination of  		these activities. All of these approaches involve use of a CPOE system. If a  		survey does not explicitly indicate the gradations of a system, survey  		respondents rely on their own interpretation. As such, some respondents may  		believe that, in order to label a system as CPOE, it must be entirely paperless  		and involve entry only by the ordering physician/provider. Under this  		understanding, the facilities at which a nurse or other staff member enters a  		physicians fax or telephone order into a CPOE system would not be counted  		as CPOE users. Other respondents, even within the same organization, may count  		this same approach as meeting the criteria of a CPOE system, and respond  		accordingly to the survey. It is impossible to know precisely what is  		represented, therefore, in results from a survey that measures simply the use  		of CPOE, without explanation or definition. </p>
<p>Finally, as shown in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>, Stratis Health  		reports the highest use of e-MARs at 49% compared to 38% in the NNHS survey and  		only 18% identified in the California HealthCare Foundation survey. The  		inconsistent findings likely are again associated with variable terminology and  		definitions across surveys and, for the two surveys that did not provide a  		definition, subjective judgment among individual respondents regarding whether  		their organizations system meets their own concept of e-MAR.  		Interestingly, the highest use estimate came from the Stratis Health survey,  		which explicitly describes an e-MAR system for purposes of the survey.</p>
<p>As highlighted in Tables 2-4, many current surveys assessing HIT use are  		limited by a lack of clarity in describing the applications being measured and  		the extent to which an application is automated, beyond characterization as  		fully operational or partially operational. This lack  		of clarity leads to differing interpretation among respondents, and ultimately,  		wide variability in use estimates for the same applications. In this context,  		it is difficult to discern which surveys have produced the most accurate  		findings or to attribute particular findings to a surveys setting or  		sample. For example, absent clear and consistent definitions of survey  		questions and response options, it is difficult, if not impossible, to make  		comparisons and draw conclusions about the rates of implementation of certain  		HIT functions across states or nationally.</p>
<p>The review of existing surveys of HIT use in long-term care underscores  		the need to develop (or refine) surveys that use clear and precise descriptions  		of the applications being measured and the way or extent to which the  		applications are being used. Specifically, data items should be designed to  		clearly describe an application and to provide precise and easily  		understandable response options that allow for gradations of use, as further  		discussed in <a href="#recommend">Section V</a>. This approach will allow  		respondents to more easily characterize their facilities systems,  		promoting accurate estimates and ensuring that survey findings can be  		consistently and appropriately interpreted and therefore relied upon to more  		accurately gauge national HIT use, state or region-specific trends, or use  		within organizations or facilities.</p>

<h3>A. Overview of Surveys Assessing HIT Use in Home Health  		and Hospice Agencies</h3>
<p>Very few surveys examining HIT use in home health and hospice agencies  		specifically have been conducted, although HHAs have been included in some  		surveys assessing HIT use in long-term care, as described in <a href="#assess">Section II</a> (e.g., the Kaushal et al. expert panel estimate;  		CCLCs 2006 survey that include MSOs in New York). Findings from the two  		national home health care surveys summarized in <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>  		present a 32% use of computerized medical records in the 2000  		National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS) compared to 58.5% use of EMR  		systems in the 2007 Philips National Study conducted by Fazzi Associates. Both  		surveys indicate that larger agencies (although measured as Medicare revenue in  		one survey and number of patients in the other) are more likely to have an EMR  		or computerized medical record (CMR). The NHHCS found no other agency  		characteristics to have a significant relationship with CMR use, whereas the  		Philips/Fazzi Associates survey found non-profit agencies and hospital-based  		agencies more likely to use an EMR system. Comparison of findings is limited by  		variability and lack of clarity in terminology and definitions within and  		across surveys, resulting in validity and reliability issues.</p>
<h3>B. Summaries of Existing Home Health and Hospice Surveys  		</h3>
<p><b><i>National Home and Hospice Care Survey</i></b></p>
<p>NCHS at the CDC conducts the NHHCS, which includes a nationally  		representative survey of licensed or certified HHAs and hospices (NCHS, 2008a,  		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhhcs.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhhcs.htm</a>).  		The NHHCS was fielded in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000. After a  		significant re-design to enhance and expand content and move from  		paper-and-pencil to computer-assisted personal interviewing administration, the  		NHHCS was fielded again in 2007. Survey data primarily are collected through  		personal interviews with administrators and staff. A Staffing Questionnaire  		also is mailed to administrators for completion by the administrator or a  		designee prior to the on-site personal interviews. Interviewers review the  		Staffing Questionnaires for completeness during the personal interviews. The  		NHHCS items related to HIT are included as part of the Staffing Questionnaire,  		in a section on Agency Information Technology Capabilities. This set of  		questions is significantly expanded compared to the 2000 NHHCS, and provides  		far greater precision in terminology, definitions, and enumeration of specific  		functions. Findings from the 2007 NHHCS are not yet available.</p>
<p>The first item in the Agency Information Technology Capabilities section  		in the 2007 NHHCS Staffing Questionnaire asks whether the responding agency  		currently has an EMRs system, defined as a "computerized version of the  		patient's medical information used in the management of the patient's health  		care", indicating that the respondent should exclude electronic records used  		only for billing and required documentation such as OASIS<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> files. A follow-up item lists  		eight EMR functions and asks whether each component is used, available but not  		used, or not available. The EMR functions enumerated are: </p>
<ul><li>CPOE -- prescriptions, labs, tests, etc.;</li>
<li>Test results (chest x-rays, labs, etc.);</li>
<li>Patient demographics;</li>
<li>Electronic reminders for tests (labs, imaging, etc.);</li>
<li>Clinical Decision-Support System (CDSS) contraindications, allergies,  		  guidelines, etc.;</li>
<li>Clinical notes;</li>
<li>Public health reporting (notifiable diseases); and</li>
<li>Sharing medical records electronically with other agencies.</li>
</ul><p>An item addressing the agency's use of electronic management systems  		includes the following responses: (a) Billing system; (b) Inventory control  		(i.e., bar coding); (c) Human resources management (personnel records); (d)  		Staff management (e.g., staffing scheduling); and (e) Accounting.  		Responses to an item on use of electronic education systems are: (a) Satellite  		Broadcast capability (in service, training); (b) Staff Internet access; and (c)  		Patient Internet access (website with patient educational materials). Three  		items address telemedicine, defining telemedicine as "the use of electronic  		communication and information technologies to provide or support clinical care  		at a distance" and asking about use of specific telemedicine functions (e.g.,  		video consults with health care professionals) and the approximate percentage  		of patients with whom telemedicine is used. Finally, five items ask about staff  		use of Electronic Point of Care Documentation systems or devices, including how  		many direct care, administrative, or other staff use the systems or devices,  		and whether devices are used for any of the following: (a) CPOE  		(prescriptions/pharmacy, labs, tests); (b) Test results; (c) Electronic  		reminders for tests; (d) CDSS guidelines or reference systems; (e) E-mail  		communication with agency staff/other staff; (f) Scheduling  		appointments/visits; (g) OASIS; or (h) Other.</p>
<p>The 2000 version of the NHHCS included an item asking whether the  		agency's medical records are computerized and if not, whether the agency plans  		to computerize its medical records within the next year. Of the 1,425  		responding agencies (a 96% response rate), approximately 32% indicated use of a  		CMR; specifically, 32.1% of responding HHAs, 18.6% of responding hospice  		agencies, and 40.3% of mixed-type agencies (offering both services). Among  		agencies with 100 or more patients, 44.8% reported use of a CMR, while only 23%  		of agencies with 50 or fewer patients reported CMR use. No other agency  		characteristics were found to have a significant relationship with CMR use,  		although data were collected on ownership (proprietary, non-profit, state or  		local government, Federal Government), affiliation (hospital or nursing home),  		chain membership, and health maintenance organization (HMO) status.</p>
<p>It may be useful to consider elements of the more precise, expanded set  		of questions on agency IT capabilities in the 2007 NHHCS when developing the  		core and expanded set of questions for assessing HIT use in nursing homes.</p>
<p><b><i>Philips National Study on the Future of Technology and Telehealth  		in Home Care</i></b></p>
<p>The National Study on the Future of Technology and Telehealth in Home  		Care was sponsored by Philips Consumer Healthcare Solutions and co-sponsored by  		the National Association for Home Care and Hospice and Fazzi Associates. The  		study was designed to determine the level of technology and telehealth adoption  		in the home care industry in general and by agency characteristics such as  		size, affiliation/type, and location and to identify decisions and strategies  		regarding telehealth and technology plans for the next 1-3 years, providing  		agency leaders with information to help guide strategic decisions related to  		technology and telehealth (Fazzi Associates, 2007; Fazzi, Ashe, &amp; Doak,  		2007,  		<a href="http://www3.medical.philips.com/resources/hsg/docs/en-us/custom/HomeCareStudy.asp">http://www3.medical.philips.com/resources/hsg/docs/en-us/custom/HomeCareStudy.asp</a>).  		</p>
<p>Fazzi Associates developed the survey based on online input regarding  		issues of interest from over 1,000 agency staff throughout the country. A  		National Steering Committee composed of agency leaders from across the country  		reviewed the online input and developed a draft survey, which was pilot tested  		and refined prior to full implementation. The survey, which was administered by  		phone, focused on four main types of technology, described as: (1) backroom  		fiscal, billing, payroll, HR IS services; (2) point of care; (3) EMRs; and (4)  		telehealth. </p>
<p>Agencies were selected using random sampling within target groups  		representing characteristics such as geographic area, rural vs. urban location,  		for-profit vs. non-profit or public health departments, ownership  		(hospital-based, hospital-affiliated, freestanding), agency size based on  		annual revenues, and use of telehealth. In addition, agencies had to have  		complete Home Health Compare scores for June 2007 and cost reports for 2005 or  		2006.</p>
<p>Preliminary survey findings reported in an Executive Level Briefing  		published in 2007 and confirmed in an April 2008 release (Fazzi, Ashe &amp;  		Doak, 2007; Fazzi Associates, 2008) indicate that 58.5% of the 976 responding  		agencies presently have EMR, 77.2% have purchased a fiscal, billing, and  		backroom system, and 61% use some form of electronic POS system, most  		frequently laptops. Interestingly, a question asking how many weeks it takes  		for new point of service (POS) users to return to original productivity levels  		yielded significant variability across respondents, with 31.6% indicating  		More than 12 weeks and 12%-18% indicating four other categories  		(0-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks, 4-8 weeks, 8-12 weeks) and 6.4% indicating users never  		reached original productivity. The survey indicated that 17.1% of respondents  		use telehealth systems, with larger agencies more likely to use them. </p>
<p>Terms (e.g., EMR, telehealth) were not clearly defined in survey  		administration materials. A Fazzi Associates slide presentation notes that  		respondents may have been confused over the definition of EMR: Does EMR  		mean "digital medical records" or integration with all segments of the health  		field? With sponsorship by telehealth product and service vendor Philips  		Consumer Healthcare Solutions, the study provided an in-depth examination of  		telehealth use and plans.</p>
<p><b><i>ASPE Draft Taxonomy of HIT Application Features for Home Health  		Agencies</i></b></p>
<p>As described in <a href="#sectionII.B">Section II.B</a> above, a  		Taxonomy of Health Information Technology Functions has been developed under  		another ASPE-funded project entitled, "Understanding the Costs and Benefits of  		Health Information Technology in Nursing Homes and Home Health Agencies". While  		substantial overlap in HIT applications exists across home health and nursing  		home settings, setting-specific versions were developed to allow respondents to  		focus on those applications of most relevance to their own work. The Draft  		Taxonomy of HIT Application Features for Home Health includes the same five  		domains as the Draft Nursing Home Taxonomy: Administration; Operations  		Management; EHR/ EMR; Medications; and Telemedicine/Telehealth. Each domain  		includes multiple application features (e.g., Census Management under the  		Administration domain). For each application feature, a definition specific to  		the home health care setting is provided. For example, Census Management,  		listed under the Administration domain, is defined as follows:  		Admissions, discharges, transfers, current list of patients, ability to  		generate lists of unduplicated admissions. The response scale for each  		application feature is the same as that used in the Nursing Home Taxonomy. The  		taxonomy was used to identify and select home health providers for a  		qualitative case study evaluation of the costs and benefits of implementing  		certain HIT functions. </p>
<p>The taxonomy and findings from the review and submission of information  		on HIT functions by five responding HHAs can be found in Taxonomy of  		Health Information Technology in Home Health Agencies -- Report C: Review by  		Representatives from Home Health Agencies and Vendors" submitted to ASPE in  		August 2007 (University of Colorado Denver, 2007b;  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2007/Taxonomy-HHA.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2007/Taxonomy-HHA.htm</a>).  		</p>
<h3>C. Overview of Surveys Assessing HIT Use in Hospitals  		and Physician Practices</h3>
<p>A number of surveys assessing HIT use in hospitals and physician  		practices (ambulatory care) have been conducted over the past several years.  		These surveys are included in this review, as they may help inform the design  		and scope of survey questions to assess HIT use in nursing home settings. As is  		the case with long-term care and home health surveys, considerable variability  		exists in item construction, terminology, definitions, sample size, and  		measurement criteria. Findings from ten surveys addressing HIT adoption and use  		in hospitals and physician practices are summarized in <a href="#table6">Table  		6</a>. A more detailed review of each survey can be found following the  		table.</p>
<h3>D. Summaries of Existing Hospital and Physician  		Practices Surveys </h3>
<p><b><i>Health Information Technology in the United States: The  		Information Base for Progress</i></b></p>
<p>The Health Information Technology in the United States: The Information  		Base for Progress, is a joint project of RWJF and the Federal Governments  		Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology. The  		research team also includes Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and George  		Washington University (GWU). A key project purpose was to identify surveys and  		studies that had attempted to measure the adoption of EHRs by US hospitals and  		physician practices, then use that information as a base to expand on adoption  		trends, adoption gaps, and policy information (RWJF, 2006, 2008,  		<a href="http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/other/EHRReport0609.pdf">http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/other/EHRReport0609.pdf</a>,  		<a href="http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/062508.hit.exsummary.pdf">http://www.rwjf.org/files/research/062508.hit.exsummary.pdf</a>).  		</p>
<p>Following a systematic review process that examined relevant  		methodologies, survey instruments, and results, the researchers identified 36  		surveys conducted between 1995 and 2005 and were able to obtain both the survey  		instrument and complete results for 22. The surveys were assessed and rated  		according to both content and methodology of EHR use measurement. </p>
<p>Physician practice and hospital EHR findings from the surveys studied in  		the ONC project are inconclusive. Physician adoption rates ranging from 9% to  		57% are reported, depending on the definition of EHR, functionalities, number  		of functionalities used, amount of time functionalities are used, and other  		variables. Hospital use is equally inconclusive with reported adoption rates  		ranging from 5% to 59%, dependent again on functionalities, integration,  		definitions, etc. </p>
<p>The researchers concluded that while there have been several surveys  		designed to assess EHR adoption, these studies have failed to produce  		valid, and reliable estimates of rates and patterns of EHR adoption at  		any point in time or longitudinally and as such, do not identify where  		and why adoption is lagging. These researchers note that, [a]lthough  		numerous surveys have attempted to measure HIT adoption and use, our current  		understanding is limited by inconsistencies in sampling techniques, data  		collection instruments and terminology, as well as varying response rates  		and the quality of available surveys is variable and generally inadequate  		to form the basis for national policy development (RWJF, 2006). </p>
<p><b><i>National Survey of Electronic Health Record Adoption in the United  		States </i></b></p>
<p>Building upon the lack of consistent data that could be obtained from  		the surveys in the aforementioned study, the ONC has contracted with GWU, MGH,  		and Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International to lead a national survey  		of physicians and physician practice managers to ascertain the level of EHR  		adoption. In the short term, this survey will provide timely, additional data  		necessary for policy development; in the long-term, the survey will provide  		background information that in the future could be incorporated into the annual  		National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) (RTI International, 2006). </p>
<p>The 2007 survey includes a broader range of EHR domains and  		functionalities, including acquisition, implementation, use, barriers,  		incentives and practice characteristics. The survey will be mailed to and  		completed by both the physician and the most knowledgeable person  		of information technology use in the physician office. </p>
<p>In an attempt to better define EHR, two options are given -- minimally  		functional EHR and Functional EHR. Minimally functional includes  		six key functionalities (clinical notes, computerized orders for prescription,  		computerized orders for labs, computerized order for radiology, viewing lab  		results, and viewing imaging results). A functional EHR includes  		the above six functionalities plus patient demographic information, patient  		problem lists, patient medication lists, medical history and follow-up notes,  		orders sent electronically for prescriptions, orders sent electronically for  		labs, orders sent electronically for radiology, electronic images are returned,  		warnings of drug interactions or contraindications, out-of-range lab levels are  		highlighted, and reminders for guideline-based interventions and screenings  		(Modern Healthcare, 2008). </p>
<p>Only general preliminary results have been released from the 2007 survey  		at this time. Using the above criteria to determine EHR use, preliminary  		results suggest that 4% of respondents indicate they have a functional EHR, and  		14% report a minimally functional EHR. </p>
<p>The 2007 survey also addresses the issues of incentives and barriers to  		EHR implementation. Preliminary results indicate that 80% of physicians thought  		monetary incentives would have an impact on adoption. Lack of capital was  		identified as a major barrier by 66% of physicians without an EHR and 36% of  		those with a functioning EHR (Modern Healthcare, 2008). Additional findings on  		barriers are presented in <a href="#table8">Table 8</a> in <a href="#barrier">Section IV</a> of this report. </p>
<p><b><i>National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)</i></b></p>
<p>NCHS at the CDC, and the U.S. Bureau of Census conduct the field data  		collection effort for the NAMCS. This survey was conducted annually from 1973  		to 1981, in 1985, and annually since 1989, with electronic health information  		or EHR questions being introduced in 2001. The 2005 survey expanded the EHR  		module to include EHR functionality, use, and non-use. The proposed 2008 survey  		will include an EMR Supplement (NCHS, 2007b, 2008b,  		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/ahcd/surinst.htm#Survey%20Instrument%20NAMCS">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/ahcd/surinst.htm#Survey%20Instrument...</a>).  		</p>
<p>The physician sample is attained through the master files of both the  		American Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association. The  		sample design includes geographic units, which are then stratified by  		specialty. The results for the 2006 survey include data from 1,281  		office-based, non-federal physicians providing direct patient care. The survey  		requests physicians to provide information on a random sample of patient visits  		during a one-week period. A face-to-face induction interview is also included  		as part of the NAMCS. The physician office data are provided to the U.S. Bureau  		of Census representatives by the physician or his/her staff. </p>
<p>EMR questions on the 2008 NAMCS survey include the following: </p>
<blockquote><p>Does your practice use electronic medical records (not including  		  billing records)? Answer options are yes, all electronic,  		  yes, part paper and part electronic, no, or  		  dont know. If yes, the survey continues with Does your  		  practice have a computerized system for the following eight function  		  capabilities, all with answer options of Yes, No, Unknown, or Turned off  		  options.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Patient demographic information? If yes, does this include problem  				lists? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orders for prescriptions? If yes, </p>
<ol type="a"><li>Are there warnings of drug interactions or contraindications  				  provided? </li>
<li>Are prescriptions sent electronically to the pharmacy?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Orders for tests? If yes, are orders sent electronically?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing lab results? If yes, are out-of-range levels  				highlighted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing imaging results? If yes, are electronic images  				returned?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical notes? If yes, do they include medical history and  				follow-up notes? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reminders for guideline-based interventions and/or screening  				tests?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public health reporting? If yes, are notifiable diseases sent  				electronically?</p>
</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Two questions that follow ask: Are there any of the above features  		of your system that you do not use or have turned off? and Are  		there plans for installing a new EMR system or replacing the current system  		within the next three years? </p>
<p>The 2008 HIT survey questions were changed slightly from the 2006  		version, which is the latest for which results are listed in this review. Some  		questions were distinctly reworded -- for example, in 2006, physicians were  		asked about their practices electronic medical record, while  		the 2008 version asks if they have a computerized system for.  		One other change between the two versions was that reminders for  		guidelines-based interventions, part of the clinical notes question in 2006,  		was separated into its own question in 2008. </p>
<p>Estimates of EMR use resulting from the 2006 survey were calculated in  		two ways: physicians were considered to use EMRs if they reported  		yes to the general question on EMR use, and physicians  		were considered to use comprehensive EMR systems if they gave a  		yes response to all four features deemed minimally  		necessary for a comprehensive EMR system. The four features required of an EMR  		system are computerized orders for prescriptions, computerized orders for  		tests, test results, and clinical notes. Results indicate 12.4% had an EMR  		system with the minimal four features of a comprehensive system, unchanged  		since 2005. Approximately 29.2% of physicians reported using full (14.5%) or  		partial (14.7%) EMR systems. This represents a 22% increase since 2005. Between  		2005 and 2006, the percentage of office-based medical practices using any form  		of EMR increased by 42%.</p>
<p>Among physicians with fully electronic systems, 63.7% reported using  		reminders for guideline-based interventions or screening tests, 52.9% used  		computerized prescription order entry, and 46.5% used computerized test order  		entry features.</p>
<p>In 2006, approximately one in four physicians without an EMR-S planned  		to install a new EMR-S within the next three years, while 31% of physicians  		with partially-electronic systems planned to replace their current systems  		within the next three years. </p>
<p>The survey does not include questions regarding EHR acquisition and/or  		installation, barriers, or incentives. However, the NAMCS provides both  		physician-level and practice-level data on EHR adoption on an annual basis.</p>
<p><b><i>American Hospital Association </i></b></p>
<p>In October and November 2006, the American Hospital Association (AHA)  		conducted a survey to determine the degree of implementation and use of HIT in  		hospitals across the United States. The results and methodology of this survey  		were released in 2007 in the report entitled Continued Progress: Hospital Use  		of Information Technology (AHA, 2007,  		<a href="http://www.aha.org/aha/content/2007/pdf/070227-continuedprogress.pdf">http://www.aha.org/aha/content/2007/pdf/070227-continuedprogress.pdf</a>).  		</p>
<p>Surveys were e-mailed and faxed to hospital CEOs in all United States  		community hospitals (both members and non-members of the AHA). Surveys could be  		returned either online or by fax. Surveys were returned by 1,543 community  		hospitals for a response rate of 31%. AHA indicates the respondent pool is a  		fairly representative sample (by size, location, region, ownership, and  		teaching status) of all United States community hospitals. </p>
<p>CEO respondents were asked about the use of specific HIT applications  		including: (1) EHRs, which were defined as systems that integrate  		electronically originated and maintained patient-level clinical health  		information, derived from multiple sources, into one point of access (an EHR  		replaces the paper medical record as the primary source of patient  		information); (2) CPOE, defined as physician ordering of medications,  		laboratory and other tests, alerts to adverse drug events; (3) other  		functionalities not normally considered part of an EHR including bar coding,  		telemedicine, and administrative functions; (4) financing of HIT systems; (5)  		barriers to use and/or implementation; and (6) involvement in clinical health  		information exchange efforts. </p>
<p>Hospital HIT adoption was measured based on implementation of select  		clinical information technology functions (e.g., access to current medical  		records, laboratory and radiology order entry and results, pharmacy order  		entry), then placed on a spectrum or level of use ranking: Getting  		Started - 0-3 functions; Low - 4-7 functions; Moderate - 8-11 functions; High -  		12-15 functions. </p>
<p>While results varied based upon hospital size, location, and teaching  		hospital affiliation, the following were reported: </p>
<ul><li>11% of hospitals had fully-implemented EHRs, with 68% reporting  		  either fully or partially-implemented EHRs;</li>
<li>46% reported high or moderate use of HIT; </li>
<li>10% of hospitals reported CPOE use at least half of the time, 16%  		  reported CPOE for ordering laboratory tests at least half of the time;</li>
<li>51% reported the use of real-time drug interaction alerts; and</li>
<li>Percent of hospitals reporting full implementation for other  		  functions:
<ul><li>60% -- Lab order entry,</li>
<li>66% -- Lab results,</li>
<li>59% -- Radiology order entry,</li>
<li>59% -- Radiology imaging results, </li>
<li>46% -- Pharmacy order entry.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The survey also reported on the greatest barriers to HIT adoption.  		Initial costs were selected as either a somewhat or significant barrier by 94%  		of respondents. Additional findings on barriers are presented in  		<a href="#barrier">Section IV</a> of this report.</p>
<p>Results from the 2006 survey also were compared to the AHA 2005 survey,  		as shown below. While the percentages between 2005 and 2006 showed a drop for  		some of the fully-implemented functions (pharmacy order entry, electronic  		orders for laboratory and radiology tests), hospitals reporting partial  		implementation rose slightly for all functions.</p>

</tr></table><p>Using the AHA spectrum of HIT use noted above, which creates levels of  		HIT use based on the number of clinical information technology functions  		reported to be fully-implemented, AHA reported that in 2006, 46% of hospitals  		reported moderate (8-11 functions) to high (12-15 functions) HIT use, compared  		to 2005 when 37% reported moderate to high HIT use. However, for both 2005 and  		2006, the percentages for Getting Started and Low HIT  		use levels combined remained very high, accounting for 63% in 2005 and 54% in  		2006. </p>
<p><b><i>Healthcare Financial Management Association, Overcoming Barriers  		to Electronic Health Record Adoption: Results of Survey and Roundtable  		Discussions</i></b></p>
<p>The Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), in association  		with the Office of the National Health Information Technology Coordinator, held  		a series of discussions and conferences to address challenges associated with  		EHR adoption. Following these conferences, a survey to identify implementation  		and barriers to EHR adoption along with recommendations to encourage adoption  		was conducted in 2006 with 176 senior health care finance executives at  		hospitals and health systems of various sizes and regions in the United States  		responding.</p>
<p>For this HFMA survey, an EHR was defined as a digital collection of a  		patients medical history and could include items like diagnosed medical  		conditions, prescribed medications, vital signs, immunizations, lab results,  		and personnel characteristics (e.g., age, weight) (HFMA, 2006,  		<a href="http://www.hfma.org/NR/rdonlyres/480C921F-8D33-48E8-A33F-1512A40F2CC8/0/ehr.pdf">http://www.hfma.org/NR/rdonlyres/480C921F-8D33-48E8-A33F-1512A40F2CC8/0/...</a>).</p>
<p>Survey findings on hospitals making significant progress in  		acquiring specific functionalities follow (n=176 responses): </p>
<ul><li>
<p>38% -- Order entry/order management. Clinical test, consults, and  			 medication order entry are managed electronically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>27% -- Results management. Physicians are able to access all  			 information on patient care delivered at the hospital or health system.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>23% -- Electronic health information/data capture. All patient  			 health records are contained in a computerized repository. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>23% -- Administrative processes. Scheduling, resource management,  			 billing, and other administrative systems are interoperable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>13% -- Clinical decision-support. Enhanced clinical performance is  			 achieved through computerized tools (e.g., computer-assisted diagnosis and  			 disease management).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>13% -- Health outcomes reporting. The system can automatically  			 extract information for quality indicator reporting. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2% -- Patient access. Patients have remote access to their  			 individual records. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The survey also addressed barriers to EHR adoption, with the lack of  		national information standards and code sets reported as the most significant  		barrier (supported by 62% of respondents). Findings for other listed barriers  		to EHR adoption are shown in <a href="#barrier">Section IV</a>. The authors  		note that the reported importance of any barrier can vary depending on the  		current level of implementation, organization size, organization type, and  		organization location. </p>
<p>A survey question regarding electronic connectivity and electronic  		exchange of clinical data was also included in this survey; however, no results  		were reported for this item. </p>
<p><b><i>Leapfrog Hospital Quality and Safety Survey</i></b></p>
<p>The Leapfrog Group (Leapfrog), a consortium of large private and public  		health care purchasers, launched a national effort in November 2000 to measure  		and publicly disseminate progress in hospitals for advances in patient safety  		and quality. Their annual survey assesses self-reported hospital performance  		based on quality and safety practices (the survey can be found at the following  		link:  		<a href="http://www.leapfroggroup.org/for_hospitals/leapfrog_hospital_survey_copy">http://www.leapfroggroup.org/for_hospitals/leapfrog_hospital_survey_copy</a>).  		For the 2007 survey, they assessed use of CPOE, defined as the ability to  		enter hospital medication orders via a computer system that includes  		decision-support software to reduce prescribing errors; that their inpatient  		CPOE system can alert physicians to at least 50% of common serious prescribing  		errors, and requires that prescribers electronically document a reason for  		overriding an interception prior to doing so. No other HIT functionality  		was addressed. Specific CPOE questions included in the 2007 survey were  		(numbering added for clarity):</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Does your hospital have a functioning CPOE system in at least one  			 unit of the hospital? Yes/No</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Yes, what percent of your hospitals total inpatient  			 medication orders (including orders made in units which do NOT have a  			 functioning CPOE) do prescribers enter via a CPOE system that: </p>
<ul><li>includes decision-support software to reduce prescribing  				errors;</li>
<li>is linked to pharmacy, laboratory, and ADT information in your  				hospital; and,</li>
<li>requires that they document electronically a reason for  				overriding an interception prior to doing so?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>What percent of inpatients have the majority of their medication  			 orders entered by a prescriber via a CPOE system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If hospitals do not have a CPOE system installed, they are then  			 asked the current stage of CPOE planning and implementation. </p>
<ul><li>currently selecting CPOE system, </li>
<li>currently implementing a CPOE system,</li>
<li>none of the above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Has your hospital implemented in the last 12 months either:</p>
<ul><li>a hospital-wide EMR system (defined as a comprehensive  				documentation of all care given to a specific patient within the entire  				hospital), or</li>
<li>a hospital-wide results reporting system that handles 90% of all  				laboratory and radiology results electronically?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>Only summary statistics are available for the 2007 survey on the  		Leapfrog website. For CPOE, of 1,330 hospitals responding, 10.6% met the CPOE  		leap, which requires hospitals to meet the following assessment  		criteria: (1) prescribers must enter hospital medication orders via a computer  		system; (2) CPOE system can alert physicians to at least 50% of common serious  		prescribing errors; and (3) prescribers must be able to electronically document  		a reason for overriding any prescribed orders. From this same survey, 6.8%  		indicated they will implement CPOE criteria by 2008. </p>
<p>For 2008, the Leapfrog Group has reportedly re-designed the survey to  		minimize reporting burden for hospitals and incorporate the latest research on  		measures that have the greatest impact on saving costs and improving quality,  		including CPOE (Leapfrog Group, 2007a, 2007b). </p>
<p><b><i>Mathematica Policy Research Survey</i></b></p>
<p>A Mathematica Policy Research survey was conducted for Centers for  		Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the summer of 2005. The stated purpose  		of the survey was to assess how public reporting of quality information has  		influenced quality improvement efforts within hospitals; if the use of  		information technology has helped improve the quality of care; and the most  		important quality improvement benefits associated with HIT use (Felt-Lisk,  		2006,  		<a href="http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/newhospinfo.pdf">http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/newhospinfo.pdf</a>).  		</p>
<p>Targeted respondents for this survey were short-term acute care general  		and critical-access hospitals that had submitted hospital quality data for the  		Hospital Compare quality initiative in 2005. The nationally representative  		sample was 375 large Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare  		Organizations (JCAHO)-accredited hospitals; 133 small, non-JCAHO-accredited  		hospitals; and 129 other hospitals. Respondents to this 30-40 minute telephone  		interview (administered using computer-assisted telephone interviewing [CATI]  		or hardcopy when requested) included 650 senior quality improvement hospital  		executives.</p>
<p>HIT was defined as the ability to collect, store, retrieve, and transfer  		clinical information electronically. A leading question to ascertain the  		various types of information technology in the hospital was asked, Do  		clinicians at your hospital use any of the following EHR capabilities?  		and then listed the six types of information technology (e-prescribing,  		electronic clinical notes systems, electronic lab orders for lab tests,  		electronic lab results, electronic images [CT, MRI, PET scans]), and electronic  		reminders. If executives indicated they were using one or more of the above HIT  		functions, they were then asked whether any had been an important factor in  		improving quality to date. If the answer was yes, they were then asked the  		open-ended question: What is the single most important way that any of  		these EHR capabilities has affected quality in the hospital?</p>
<p>Results indicate the percentage reported using a specific HIT  		capability: </p>
<ul><li>21% -- E-prescribing ;</li>
<li>59% -- Electronic clinical notes systems; </li>
<li>49% -- Electronic lab orders for lab tests; </li>
<li>88% -- Electronic lab results; </li>
<li>50% -- Electronic images (CT, MRI, PET scans); and</li>
<li>24% -- Electronic reminders. </li>
</ul><p>Reported results indicated that 80% of hospital executives thought that  		information technology use had been an important factor in quality improvement;  		however, the noted quality improvement benefits were dependent on the types of  		information technology capabilities implemented in each hospital. </p>
<p><b><i>18th Annual HIMSS Leadership Study: Healthcare CIO  		Results</i></b></p>
<p>The HIMSS Leadership Survey is conducted annually and in this review,  		the results from the 2007 web-based CIO survey are reported (HIMSS, 2007b,  		2007c). The survey can be found at  		<a href="http://www.himss.org/2007Survey/healthcareCIO_questionnaire.asp">http://www.himss.org/2007Survey/healthcareCIO_questionnaire.asp</a>.  		Three hundred sixty completed surveys were received from hospitals or  		ambulatory care facilities (87%), physician offices/clinics (5%), long-term  		care facilities (1.3%), HHAs (1.9%), and other health care organizations. The  		survey includes questions on a Participant Profile, Information Technology  		Priorities, Vendor Satisfaction, Information Technology Applications, RHIOs,  		Information Technology Security, Information Technology Governance, Information  		Technology Staffing, and Information Technology Budget. Selected results from  		the Information Technology Priorities and Information Technology Applications  		section are noted below.</p>
<p>Survey respondents identified the five health care applications (from a  		list of 25) that they considered most important over the next two years, as  		noted below: </p>
<ul><li>46.9% -- CPOE; </li>
<li>46.9% -- EMR; </li>
<li>45.8% -- Clinical Information Systems; </li>
<li>42.9% -- Bar Coded Medication Management; </li>
<li>37.3% -- Clinical Data Repository (CDR); and </li>
<li>35.0% -- Enterprise-wide Clinical Information Sharing. </li>
</ul><p>Respondents also were asked to identify/select five technologies that  		their organization planned to use in the next two years. The five responses  		with the highest percentages are listed below: </p>
<ul><li>73.7% -- Bar coding; </li>
<li>63.7% -- High-speed networks; </li>
<li>62.8% -- Intranet ; </li>
<li>61.5% -- Tablet computers ; and </li>
<li>60.1% -- Document imaging. </li>
</ul><p>Respondents were asked to describe the status of the organizations  		current use of an EMR system, defined by HIMSS as an electronically  		originated and maintained clinical health information, derived from multiple  		sources, about an individuals lifetime health status and health care. An  		EMR is supported by clinical decision systems and replaces the paper medical  		record as the primary source of patient information. Selected results for  		this question are noted below: </p>
<ul><li>31.9% -- Have fully operational EMR system in place; </li>
<li>36.7% -- Have begun to install EMR hardware and software;</li>
<li>16.0% -- Have developed a plan to implement an EMR system; and </li>
<li>8.4% -- Have not yet begun to plan for the use of an EMR system.  		  </li>
</ul><p>CIOs also were asked to identify the most significant barrier to  		information technology implementation in their organization.

<p>The HIMSS Analytics EMR Adoption Model identifies the levels of EMR  		capabilities ranging from the initial CDR environment through a paperless EMR  		environment. From a HIMSS database of approximately 4,000 hospitals, HIMSS  		Analytics was able to score the included hospitals as to their place in the  		adoption model.

<p>The Medical Records Institute (MRI) carried out the 8th Annual Survey of  		Electronic Health Record Trends and Usage for 2006. This is an annual survey of  		information technology usage among various sizes and types of health care  		providers (hospitals, physician practices, integrated health delivery service  		organizations). The survey was conducted among e-mail prescribers to MRI or  		Towards the Electronic Paper Record (TEPR), and attendees at a TEPR conference  		in 2006. Excluding vendors and consultants, there were 729 responses, with the  		largest group of respondents being physicians (22.6%), then medical information  		system professionals (10.2%) (MRI, 2006,  		<a href="http://www.medrecinst.com/PDFs/EHRSurvey_2006.pdf">http://www.medrecinst.com/PDFs/EHRSurvey_2006.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>MRI takes note that the results from their surveys are not accurate  		measures of EHR implementation in the industry, rather the results can be seen  		as an indicator of relative implementation levels and future plans.  		Also, as this is an annual survey, MRI is able to compare results from previous  		years.</p>
<p>For the 2006 survey, MRI requested facility and respondent demographics,  		then raised questions regarding priority for strategic information technology  		decisions, what factors are driving the need for EHR systems in  		both hospitals and medical practices, methods for data capture, methods for  		clinical information entry to the EHR, applications and functions in use and/or  		planned for implementation (administrative, EHR data capture and review, remote  		access, hospital order entry applications and functions, e-prescribing, use of  		continuity of care record, access to reference information, e-mail  		applications, clinical data repositories), and major barriers to implementation  		of an EHR. Other questions with regard to RFID, wireless connectivity  		technology, and safety improvements were included in the survey but are not  		highlighted in this review.</p>
<p>Selected results from the 2006 annual survey are noted below, however,  		results are not broken out for different provider types or facility types. </p>
<p>EHR Data Capture, Review, and Update Capabilities -- In use:</p>
<ul><li>60.2% -- Demographics; </li>
<li>46.9% -- Laboratory results; </li>
<li>44.2% -- Medications taken; and </li>
<li>42.7% -- Radiology results. </li>
</ul><p>Hospital physician order entry WITH clinical decision-support -- In  		use:</p>
<ul><li>14.8% -- Pharmacy; </li>

</ul><p>E-prescribing to commercial/retail pharmacies -- In use: </p>
<ul><li>23.9% -- New prescriptions; and</li>
<li>23.5% -- Prescription renewal.</li>
</ul><p>Lack of adequate funding or resources was identified as a major barrier  		to EHR implementation by 55.5% of respondents. Additional findings on barriers  		are presented in <a href="#barrier">Section IV</a> of this document. </p>

<p><b><i>Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary  		Care Physicians </i></b></p>
<p>Researchers at the Commonwealth Fund and Harris Interactive designed and  		conducted this international survey of primary care physicians in Australia,  		Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United  		States. The purpose of the 2006 survey was to obtain cross-national physician  		practice information, with an information technology and clinical record  		systems focus.</p>
<p>Physicians for the international survey were randomly selected from  		lists available from private or government sources. The four-page  		questionnaire/survey was conducted in each countrys native language,  		either by mail (Canada, Netherlands, United States -- 43-51% response rate) or  		phone (Germany and the United Kingdom-phone only; New Zealand and  		Australia-phone recruitment, mail and fax -- 18-32% response rate). There were  		1,004 respondents from the United States and for this summary, United States  		results will be featured.</p>
<p>Questions for HIT use were as follows with United States results noted  		(Schoen et al., 2007,  		<a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/topline_results_2006_IHPsurvey2.pdf?section=4056">http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/topline_results_2006_IHPsurvey2.pdf?section=4056</a>).  		</p>

<p><i><b>National Study of Physician Organizations (NSPO) and the  		Management of Chronic Illness (Medical Groups)  </b></i></p>
<p>This survey was conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, and  		RWJF in September 2000-September 2001. The purpose of the survey was to  		implement and create a national database on physician organizations. Survey  		data were collected on practice demographics, size, ownership, type, and volume  		of patients seen; management and governance of the organization; compensation  		models; relationships with health plans; and implementation of care management  		practices and quality improvement approaches. From five large databases, 1,587  		medical groups and independent practice associations with 20 or more physicians  		were identified and contacted for the survey, 1,040 physician offices  		responded. Sixty-minute CATI surveys were conducted with each organization's  		president, CEO, or medical director. Physician groups that completed the survey  		were given a stipend of $150. Field visits and follow-up phone interviews were  		conducted in 24 practices to validate the self-report data. </p>
<p>Survey questions pertaining to information technology use were as listed  		below. Results provided in the reviewed report are noted in boldfaced  		parentheses (Casalino et al., 2003; Simon, Rundall, &amp; Shortell, 2005,  		<a href="http://nspo.berkeley.edu/index.htm">http://nspo.berkeley.edu/index.htm</a>).  		</p>

</ul><h3>E. Comparison of Survey Findings on HIT Use in Hospitals  		and Physician Practices</h3>
<p>The reviewed surveys are varied with respect to targeted respondents,  		sample size, methodology, data item construction, definitions, and other  		variables. While some surveys asked about actual use (Commonwealth, MRI, NSPO,  		NAMCS), other surveys addressed the levels of implementation, using varying  		methods of measurement; (e.g., fully operational [HIMSS], significant progress  		[HFMA], or fully or partially-implemented [NAMCS, AHA]). One survey (Leapfrog)  		addressed only the implementation of CPOE, while other surveys attempted to  		measure EHR use, separately assessed use of the multiple clinical functions  		within an EHR, or measured use and adoption of EMRs or HIT. Given this  		variability, it is possible only to make a few generalized comparisons of the  		estimates resulting from the surveys. <a href="#table7">Table 7</a> presents  		findings from the surveys that used similar terminology in assessing EHR/EMR  		implementation in hospitals and/or physician practices, showing a range of  		estimates from 4% to about 32% with to regard to EMR or EHR use. </p>
<p>As was the case in examining surveys of HIT use in nursing homes (and  		other long-term care settings), comparisons of survey findings of hospital and  		physician HIT adoption is limited by variability and lack of clarity in  		terminology and definitions within and across surveys, resulting in validity  		and reliability issues. This variability and lack of clarity makes it difficult  		to discern which surveys have produced the most accurate findings or to  		attribute particular findings to a surveys setting or sample.</p>

<p>Despite national support for widespread adoption of HIT across health  		care settings and growing recognition of its value in improving health care  		safety, quality, and efficiency, HIT adoption continues at a relatively slow  		pace. Recent efforts have been made to identify barriers contributing to the  		limited progress in HIT adoption beyond commonly used administrative functions,  		and supply information to help guide the development of policies and incentives  		to promote more rapid HIT proliferation. </p>
<p><a href="#table8">Table 8</a> summarizes the findings from ten recent  		surveys that addressed barriers to HIT adoption in a variety of health care  		settings. Four surveys targeted administrators and other HIT "decision makers"  		in nursing homes and other long-term care organizations. Three of these surveys  		were state-specific (California, Minnesota, and New York), while one (Maestro  		Strategies) included 36 multi-facility long-term care organizations from across  		the country. In addition, six surveys obtained feedback on barriers from  		physicians, CEOs, health care finance executives, information technology  		managers, and other respondents primarily from hospitals and physician  		practices.</p>
<p>The ten surveys summarized in the table use a variety of measurement  		approaches to capture feedback on HIT adoption barriers. Response options vary  		considerably; for example, respondents are asked to rate listed barriers as  		a significant barrier, somewhat of a barrier, or  		not a barrier; select the one most important barrier; select all  		that apply as significant barriers; or rate barriers on a scale of 1 (not a  		problem) to 5 (makes implementation extremely difficult). The lists of barriers  		presented for respondent feedback are not consistent across surveys, although  		they contain substantial conceptual overlap. Terminology/phrasing of barriers  		also is inconsistent across surveys. Even minor variation in wording can  		influence respondent interpretation and affect his or her perception of the  		degree to which a particular factor is a barrier to HIT adoption.</p>
<p>Despite the variability in measurement approaches and phrasing related  		to cost issues (e.g., lack of capital resources, lack of financial support,  		initial costs, lack of adequate funding or resources), cost -- particularly for  		initial investment in HIT software -- remains an easily identifiable top  		barrier for most health care facilities and organizations across settings. Only  		two of the ten surveys reviewed did not identify cost issues as the greatest  		barrier or challenge. Specifically, respondents to a Maestro Strategies survey  		of 36 long-term care multi-facility AHCA members identified  		obsolescence/limited functionality of legacy systems, end user support, and  		software incompatibilities as their greatest challenges with HIT, while a HFMA  		survey of 176 senior health care finance executives at hospitals and health  		systems identified lack of national standards and code sets as the top barrier  		(cost remained a primary issue, however, as lack of available funding was a  		close second).</p>
<p>Interestingly, results from the California Healthcare Foundation survey  		of long-term care organizations show variability among nursing homes that were  		hospital-based, part of multi-facility organizations, and freestanding with  		regard to the importance of cost as a barrier. Lack of capital resources was  		supported by 80% of hospital-based nursing facilities as a significant barrier  		and 78% of freestanding nursing homes, but only 44% of multi-facility  		organizations. The lesser degree of support of cost as a critical barrier by  		multi-facility organizations is corroborated by the findings of the Maestro  		Strategies survey of multi-facility organizations across the nation where  		"expense of transitioning from paper to electronic records" was fifth in the  		selection of greatest challenges with information technology. For the five  		hospital-based and 27 freestanding nursing homes in the California survey, lack  		of capital resources was the top barrier, while this was third for the 32  		multi-facility organizations, after lack of integration with other systems  		(56%) and lack of computer skills among staff (53%). For the hospital-based  		nursing homes in the California survey, lack of professional information  		technology staff was the second most supported barrier, while lack of  		reimbursement for using information technology was second among the  		freestanding nursing homes.</p>
<p>Outside of initial and ongoing/maintenance costs, the reviewed surveys  		yielded considerable variability with regard to the top barriers to HIT  		implementation. Other noted barriers (again, described using variable  		terminology), perceived as fairly significant in some surveys and less  		significant in other surveys, include concern about integration of HIT systems  		with other software; physician resistance; lack of standards/code sets;  		obsolescence of legacy systems; lack of technical/information technology staff;  		staff lacking computer skills; inability of technology to meet needs; return on  		investment; transitioning historic data into new system; concern about loss of  		productivity during transition to new system; lack of time to select, contract,  		install, and implement software/technology; vendor issues; and security/privacy  		concerns. Although resistance by users of HIT systems (particularly physicians)  		was a frequently supported barrier among the hospital/physician practice  		surveys, "end user support" was reported as one of the top barriers by only one  		of the four long-term care surveys.</p>
<p>Many of the existing survey items addressing barriers to HIT adoption  		and use can provide a useful foundation for developing survey items targeting  		nursing homes in particular, to add to the limited current findings in this  		area.</p>

<p>The purpose of both the core survey and drill-down questions to be  		specified in this project is to further our understanding of the adoption and  		use of HIT applications related to clinical care, including those applications  		used for health information exchange with other providers. The core set of  		questions could be fielded as part of the NNHS that is administered  		periodically by NCHS or as a stand-alone survey. Both the core set of questions  		and the drill-down questions will be available to nursing home/long-term care  		industry stakeholder groups (e.g., AHCA, AAHSA), which could administer the  		questions to members to derive detailed information on the adoption of HIT in  		general, as well as implementation of specific HIT applications, including the  		use of products designed to incorporate national standards (e.g., HL7 messaging  		standards, LOINC semantic standards). </p>
<p><b><i>Core Set of HIT/EHR Survey Questions</i></b></p>
<p>This parsimonious set of questions (e.g., 8-15 items) could enhance the  		HIT/EHR-related data item currently collected by the NNHS (or others) by  		gathering more specific information on the adoption of specified HIT  		applications. For example, data items could target a list of HIT  		functionalities, and define different levels of HIT adoption for each  		application as part of the question responses. The questions developed for  		potential use with the NNHS would be designed so the results could be compared  		with NCHS surveys fielded in other provider settings (e.g., the National Home  		Health and Hospice Survey, the NAMCS) to promote the ability to assess HIT  		adoption across provider types. In addition, the questions would be designed so  		that the data gathered could be considered along with other survey data to  		address other questions important for national health policy (e.g., is there a  		difference in rates of rehospitalization in nursing homes adopting EHRs vs.  		those not adopting EHRs). An advantage of fielding questions with the NNHS is  		that the survey would be administered to a large, representative group of  		nursing homes, allowing the findings to be generalized to the nursing home  		industry. In addition, because the NNHS is fielded with nursing homes on a  		regular basis, it would be possible to track HIT/EHR adoption rates over time.  		The primary disadvantage to incorporating these questions into the NNHS is that  		data collection efforts beyond the data normally collected for the NNHS must be  		financially sponsored by an interested agency. In addition, the number of  		questions/data items must be limited to minimize overall survey burden.  		Therefore, careful consideration is needed to limit the focus and number of  		questions related to nursing home EHR/HIT adoption, use, and barriers that  		could be included in the NNHS.</p>
<p><b><i>Domains of Interest</i></b></p>
<p>The ASPE Nursing Home HIT taxonomy includes categories for  		administrative functions, operations management functions, EHR functions,  		functions related to medication ordering and management, and telehealth  		functions. Based on information derived from experts in long-term care (nursing  		homes) and vendors of HIT products for nursing homes as well as findings from  		existing nursing home/long-term care surveys, we believe that most facilities  		currently use various administrative information technology functions. CMS has  		announced that it will be requiring nursing home providers to complete and  		electronically transmit, beginning in October 2009, a new version of the  		nursing home MDS assessment, the MDSv3. ASPE is sponsoring work linking  		accepted HIT standards to the MDSv3 in an effort to promote the use of  		interoperable software by nursing home providers. The MDSv3 linked with  		accepted HIT standards will be made available to CMS and nursing home providers  		and vendors so that either CMS could use these standards in its MDSv3 data  		specifications, and/or providers could ask vendors for software that supports  		the use of these applied standards. Thus, consideration will be given as to the  		inclusion of survey questions concerning the use of HIT standards for various  		applications, including in the completion and transmission of assessments.</p>
<p>Of particular interest for nursing home facilities and policy makers are  		the use of HIT applications that support improvements in patient safety and  		communication/coordination among care providers, and increases in efficiency in  		clinical work processes. Therefore, we recommend that the focus of both sets of  		survey questions address applications that support these objectives. </p>
<p>The use of HIT applications for the following functions will be  		considered for the core set of survey questions: </p>
<ul><li>Resident Demographic Data;</li>
<li>Problem and Allergy Lists;</li>
<li>Advance Directives;</li>
<li>Assessment/Care Planning (including MDS);</li>
<li>Clinical Notes;</li>
<li>CNA Charting and Workflow (e.g., electronic task lists by  		  resident);</li>
<li>MAR;</li>
<li>TAR;</li>
<li>Provider Orders -- Medications and Non-Medications;</li>
<li>Results Viewing (Lab, Imaging, Consults);</li>
<li>Automated Clinical Decision-Support Tools;</li>
<li>Summary Reports and Quality Management Reports; and</li>
<li>Telehealth and Telemonitoring.</li>
</ul><p>Questions likely will be included to assess degree or level of  		automation (paper only, combination paper/electronic, or fully electronic) for  		key functions; use of clinical decision-support tools for a subset of relevant  		functions; and health information exchange capabilities (within and outside of  		a facility or health system). In addition, information on barriers to adoption  		and benefits of HIT will be included. <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> provides  		an example of a possible question concerning barriers to adoption and use of  		HIT. The illustrative question was built on a question on barriers included in  		the national physician survey developed under an ONC contract (RTI  		International, 2006).</p>
<p><b><i>Drill-Down Questions on HIT/EHR Use in Nursing Homes</i></b></p>
<p>A set of drill-down questions that key off of responses to the core set  		of questions is proposed to provide a better understanding of actual  		implementation of HIT by nursing homes that are actively using it to support  		clinical work functions. We anticipate that the drill-down questions could be  		administered by industry stakeholder groups (e.g., AHCA, AAHSA) and recommend  		that the questions be administered using a web-based format. Using a web  		application rather than paper-and-pencil administration allows respondents to  		view only those questions relevant to them based on their responses to the core  		questions, thus substantially reducing the average number of questions to be  		answered by each respondent and, correspondingly, the amount of time needed to  		complete the survey.</p>
<p><a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> provides an example of how the  		drill-down methodology could work for a possible core survey question on the  		level of automation used for a facilitys MAR. </p>
<p>Depending on the response to a core survey question, drill-down  		questions will allow for assessment of details related to the target function.  		Using the example in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, if the respondent selects  		response option a (i.e., Paper Only)to the core question regarding level of  		automation for a facilitys MAR, then no drill-down questions are asked.  		If a respondent selects response option b or c to the core question, then a  		series of follow-up questions on the MAR are asked (e.g., regarding the  		authoritative record, data capture, etc.). Survey questions will be logically  		sequenced so that the appropriate follow-up questions will be programmed to  		automatically appear on the users computer screen. </p>
<p>The advantage of the drill-down questions is the potential to collect  		data that would allow the industry to track not only adoption rates, but  		provide detailed information on the level of automation, use of clinical  		decision-support tools, and health information exchange capabilities. The  		disadvantage is that surveys administered by provider groups tend to have lower  		response rates than those fielded by NCHS and are subject to respondent bias  		(i.e., nursing homes who are members of the provider group may adopt HIT/EHR at  		higher rates than the industry as a whole). In addition, it is important to  		consider the length of the survey and associated response burden. Careful  		consideration will be required regarding the number and focus of drill-down  		questions to ensure that only those questions that will provide meaningful data  		about HIT implementation in nursing homes are included. As mentioned, response  		burden will be reduced by use of a web-based survey process that incorporates  		automated skip patterns. Combining the core and the drill-down questions is  		expected to provide comprehensive information about the breadth and depth of  		HIT adoption in nursing homes. </p>
<p><b><i>Types of Facilities and Survey Respondents</i></b></p>
<p>Both sets of survey questions should be geared toward various facility  		auspices and ownership, including facilities that are proprietary and  		non-profit; stand-alone, corporate chain, hospital-based, CCRC, etc. One of the  		first questions in the more comprehensive survey instrument should gather data  		on facility characteristics. Facility characteristics information already  		gathered as part of the NNHS would be included and could perhaps be expanded  		(e.g., to specify regional or national chain affiliation). The more  		comprehensive survey instrument would gather information about each  		facilitys location, size, ownership status, and certification status.  		</p>
<p>Survey respondents for the NNHS are typically administrators or  		designated staff with the information necessary to complete the survey  		questions. For the drill-down questions on nursing home HIT functions, it is  		likely that the respondent will be a CIO (or equivalent) who are responsible  		for the purchase and maintenance of software applications for the facility, and  		clinicians with a responsibility for the implementation of software  		applications for the facility.</p>
<p><b><i>Technical Expert Panel Review and Final Report</i></b></p>
<p>Following development of the draft survey questions, a technical expert  		panel (TEP) will be convened. The TEP will consist of stakeholders from the  		ONC, ASPE, and NCHS, along with experts in HIT for long-term care, nursing home  		administration, and survey development. The TEP will review the draft questions  		and offer feedback on content, wording, and format. The TEP will be asked to  		judge the feasibility of implementing the two surveys in terms of potential  		respondent burden and cost, and to provide suggestions on survey  		implementation. After TEP feedback is compiled, both sets of survey questions  		will be refined and submitted to ASPE as part of a final project report.</p>
