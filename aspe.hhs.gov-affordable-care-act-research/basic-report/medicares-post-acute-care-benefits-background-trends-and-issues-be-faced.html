<p>The escalating scale of expenditures for Medicare's post-acute care  		benefits--from about $2.5 billion in 1986 to more than $30 billion in 1996--has  		catalyzed concern among policy makers that use of these services has become  		excessive and does not necessarily improve the health of beneficiaries. Acting  		on these concerns, the 1997 Balance Budget Act (BBA), among other things,  		mandated prospective payment systems for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs),  		home health care, and rehabilitation facilities, and required a legislative  		proposal on a prospective payment system for long-term care hospitals. Changing  		from retrospective to prospective payment for post-acute care represents a  		major policy response to the expenditure escalation. But it does not address  		many other cost, quality, and access concerns.</p>
<p>Foremost among these is concern that Medicare continues to treat the  		different types of post-acute care providers differently--in terms of payment,  		eligibility, coverage, and certification -even though the different types of  		providers may be becoming more and more similar in the types and intensity of  		services they deliver, as well as the types of patients they serve. Other  		concerns include policy-induced incentives to discharge patients for financial  		rather than quality of care reasons and access problems faced by heavy-care  		patients.</p>
<p>In response to this changing policy environment and the policy concerns  		it is raising, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation in the Department of Health and Human Services sponsored a study to  		examine potential problems with Medicare's post-acute care services and explore  		promising solutions. As the first product of that study, this report provides  		background on:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Recent growth in Medicare's post-acute care expenditures and  			 utilization, and Medicare policy changes that have contributed to these  			 trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth in the supply and changes in the distribution of the four  			 major types of post-acute care providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characteristics of beneficiaries, providers, and market areas that  			 are associated with differential use of particular types of post-acute care  			 providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analytic and policy issues that need to be addressed in the effort  			 to find effective policy solutions to the problems that now exist with respect  			 to Medicare's post-acute care benefits.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Trends in Utilization and Expenditures</h3>
<p>Until very recently, Medicare payments for all types of post-acute care  		have been growing at 25- 35 percent a year, depending on the type of provider  		and exact time period covered. They are now declining but are still  		substantially higher than the roughly 8 percent annual growth that  		characterizes other parts of the Medicare program. SNF and home health care  		account for most of the Medicare post-acute care spending (and therefore much  		of its spending growth). SNF spending growth was due primarily to increases in  		the numbers of users and increased use of ancillary services, while home health  		care growth was fueled by increasing numbers of users and increased number of  		visits per user.</p>
<p>As a result of this enormous growth, Medicare payments for SNF and home  		health care have grown from 3 percent of all Medicare expenditures in 1986 to  		15 percent in 1996. During the same period, Medicare spending for inpatient  		hospital care declined from 61 percent to 49 percent. (It should be noted that  		these statistics understate the actual shift from acute- to post-acute care,  		because post-acute care hospitals are included in the inpatient total.)</p>
<h3>Changes in Provider Supply</h3>
<p>Between 1990 and 1996, the supply of all major types of Medicare  		post-acute care providers experienced double-digit growth. The number of SNFs  		increased from 10,500 to 15,500, the number of home health care providers from  		5,800 to 9,900, the number of rehabilitation hospitals and distinct part units  		from 813 to 1,048, and the number of long-term care hospitals from 90 to 185.  		Ownership of post-acute care providers has also been shifting, with for-profit  		status becoming more common. Within these overall trends, the regional  		distribution of different types of post-acute care providers has remained  		uneven, with some regions being generally under- or over-represented relative  		to their shares of beneficiaries and other regions having disproportionately  		large (or small) shares of some but not all provider types. Regional patterns  		of use are broadly consistent with the regional patterns of relative  		supply.</p>
<h3>Medicare Eligibility and Coverage Policies</h3>
<p>A major reason for the enormous expansion in post-acute care  		expenditures and supply has been changes in SNF and home health care  		eligibility and coverage guidelines, some of which were mandated by court  		decisions. The 1986 court ruling in <i>Fox v. Bowen</i> resulted in revised  		guidelines for the SNF benefit, effective in 1988, making more explicit the  		conditions that constituted eligibility for the SNF benefit and forbidding  		fiscal intermediaries from using "rule of thumb" to facilitate claim denial.  		The 1988 ruling in <i>Duggan v. Bowen</i> resulted in revised guidelines for  		the home health care benefit, effective in 1989, which included qualifying  		patients for skilled observation (and therefore for the home health benefit)  		with stable health needs -rather than expectations of improvement, as the  		former criterion had specified. Predictably, denial rates dropped for both  		types of claims following implementation of the new guidelines.</p>
<h3>Payment Reforms Mandated by the BBA</h3>
<p>The BBA mandated establishment of prospective payment systems (PPS) for  		SNFs effective July 1998, home health care effective October 1999, and  		rehabilitation facilities effective October 2000. It also required that a PPS  		proposal be developed for long-term care hospitals by October 1999.</p>
<p>It is important to note that (except for home health care) these systems  		are expected to be based on per diem payments rather than the per episode PPS  		system instituted in 1984 for acute care hospitals. Per diem systems help  		contain costs by establishing in advance a unit price for each service. But  		they do not contain incentives to limit the volume of services delivered.  		Episode systems, by placing the provider at risk for the entire costs of an  		episode, embody incentives to control price and volume--although they may  		present additional quality-of-care problems through their incentive to reduce  		length of stay.</p>
<p><i>Skilled Nursing Facilities</i>. BBA moved SNFs into a per diem PPS  		that covers routine, ancillary, and capital costs--including post-hospital SNF  		services for which benefits are provided under Part A and most items previously  		paid for under Part B. The new system is being phased in, with payment for the  		first three years based on a combination of a casemix-adjusted Federal rate and  		(in shrinking importance) a facility's historical costs. By the fourth year,  		the historical cost component is scheduled to disappear. The BBA also included  		a consolidated billing measure, requiring the SNFs to bill for all services  		delivered for Part A stays (with specific exceptions to cover hospital-related  		services generally beyond the capacity of SNFs to provide). This consolidated  		billing requires SNFs to bill for services under Part B, including services  		delivered by independent therapists and other non-staff entities.</p>
<p><i>Home Health Care Providers</i>. The BBA mandated an interim payment  		system (IPS) to capture Medicare savings until PPS is implemented for these  		providers. The IPS modified Medicare's home health payment method in two ways.  		First, it reduced the national cost limits for each service type from 112  		percent of the average cost per visit to 105 percent of the median cost.  		Second, it added a new cost limit criterion to the payment formula. Instead of  		payments being based on the lower of the agency's actual costs or aggregate  		cost limit for the year, payments are now based on the lowest of the previous  		two limits or an average per beneficiary expenditure limit. Responding to  		concerns that the IPS would adversely impact both providers and beneficiaries,  		Congress marginally liberalized the IPS limits in the 1998 omnibus  		appropriations legislation.</p>
<p><i>Rehabilitation Hospitals</i>. The BBA gave the Secretary of Health  		and Human Services broad discretion in designing a PPS for these providers,  		subject to Congressional mandates to: (1) establish patient casemix groups and  		develop a method of assigning patients within these groups; (2) assign each  		group a weight that reflects the relative facility resources used by the group;  		and (3) determinine a prospective payment rate for each group payable under  		Medicare.</p>
<p><i>Long-Term Care Hospitals</i>. The BBA required the Secretary to  		collect the data necessary to develop, establish, administer, and evaluate a  		casemix-adjusted PPS for these hospitals. A legislative proposal is also to be  		developed for establishing and administering a payment system that includes a  		patient classification system that reflects differences in resource use.</p>
<h3>Characteristics and Outcomes of Post-Acute Care  		Users</h3>
<p>The policy concern that Medicare may be paying different amounts to  		different types of post-acute care providers for patients with essentially  		similar care needs raises important questions: What is the extent of patient  		overlap? Are payments too high or too low for one type of provider relative to  		others, for a given quality of care? Most fundamental, what are the appropriate  		resource levels required to achieve desired outcomes for patients with  		particular needs?</p>
<p>Little information is available to address these questions. Hospital  		discharge patterns by DRGs of post-acute care patients show that the same DRGs  		can be found in the caseloads of all four provider types. At the same time,  		however, the distribution of patients by DRG is by no means uniform across  		provider type. In addition, patients within a given DRG can vary in terms of  		specific diagnosis, conditions, and co-morbidities, throwing back into question  		how much overlap there really is at this more refined classification level.</p>
<p>The heterogeneity within DRGs has led researchers to look for patient  		characteristics that might be associated with different types of post-acute  		care providers. Two conspicuous candidates are health or functional status and  		availability of informal care. With respect to the former, people who are very  		frail or disabled are less likely to be able to withstand (or benefit from)  		intensive rehabilitation therapy. With respect to the latter, availability of  		informal care almost certainly increases the likelihood that post-acute care  		can be provided on a home care basis.</p>
<p>Certain hospital characteristics are also associated with the type of  		post-acute care to which patients are discharged. Larger or teaching hospitals,  		for example, are more likely than other acute care hospitals to discharge  		patients to rehabilitation services, plausibly because such hospitals are more  		likely to contain rehabilitation units. Proprietary hospitals are more likely  		than non-profit hospitals to discharge patients to home health care, plausibly  		because they are more likely to own home health agencies. Some interactions  		between types of post-acute care have also been noted. For example,  		rehabilitation facility bed supply is positively associated with the rate of  		Medicare home health care use, suggesting that these two types of care are used  		in sequence for significant numbers of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>On the relation between patient outcomes and costs, there is a paucity  		of information beyond the findings of a few studies. One study--comparing  		patients with hip fracture or stroke in rehabilitation facilities versus  		subacute SNFs and traditional SNFs--found that stroke patients had better  		functional recovery and community placement chances as a result of the (higher  		cost) rehabilitation facilities' environment. But the higher cost therapy did  		not confer additional benefits on hip fracture patients. Another study found  		that patients with hip fracture or stroke had better functional improvement in  		rehabilitation facilities or home care than similar patients discharged to  		nursing homes--suggesting, in turn, that more targeted discharge placement can  		achieve functional improvements at little or no additional cost to  		Medicare.</p>
<h3>Unresolved Policy and Analytical Issues</h3>
<p>The 1997 BBA provisions mandating PPS for Medicare's post-acute care  		benefit were an important policy response to the recent, rapid increases in  		post-acute care expenditures. The BBA provisions, however, are only part of a  		continuing process to reform Medicare's post-acute care services. Other  		important cost, quality, and access issues relevant to post-acute care under  		Medicare were not considered by the BBA. The following questions enumerate some  		of these concerns.</p>
<p><i><b>Are increasing expenditures evidence that Medicare's system of  		post-acute care services is broken?</b></i> Greater than expected increases in  		expenditures are almost always a catalyst for a policy response. It is  		reasonable to ask, however, whether the growth in spending was justified  		because of increasing need for post-acute care, particularly in light of  		declining growth in inpatient hospital spending. Although there is evidence to  		suggest that some spending may have been inappropriate (e.g., recent GAO  		reports of fraud and abuse in the Medicare home health program), it is crucial  		that we improve our estimation of the extent to which the increase in spending  		reflects real increases in need for post-acute care.</p>
<p><i><b>What is the goal of Medicare's home health program?</b></i> One  		factor behind the recent growth in Medicare's home health spending was the  		increase in number of visits beneficiaries received. That trend has raised  		questions about whether Medicare's home health services have been transformed  		into a long-term care benefit. We do not know the number of people who are  		using the benefit in this way. More important, there is lack of agreement about  		whether Medicare should, as a matter of policy, continue to cover persons  		needing extended home care services.</p>
<p><b><i>What will be the access, quality, and cost consequences of the BBA  		provisions?</i></b> Designed to curb future spending increases for post-acute  		care providers, the BBA provisions could have adverse consequences for  		beneficiaries, as well as some providers. The prospective payment systems could  		provide incentives for SNFs, home health care providers, rehabilitation  		facilities, and other providers to contain costs by selecting for relatively  		light care patients or by giving fewer services. Similar to the situation after  		Medicare implemented hospital PPS, there is the danger that patients will be  		discharged "quicker and sicker." To the extent that post-acute care services in  		general are constrained by the BBA provisions, increases in hospital  		readmissions could also result.</p>
<p><i><b>Will the supply of post-acute care providers change and how will  		these changes affect Medicare beneficiaries?</b></i> According to anecdotal  		reports, some home health agencies are closing in the wake of the IPS mandated  		by the BBA. Potential changes in the supply of home health care providers are  		an indication of the effects of the BBA provisions on the supply of post-acute  		care providers. Depending on the specific features of the PPS systems to be  		developed for rehabilitation facilities and long-term care hospitals,  		incentives may be created that will decrease (or increase) their supply as  		well. Changes in the supply of post-acute care providers will likely affect  		beneficiaries' use of acute and post-acute care services.</p>
<p><b><i>What is the effect of eligibility and coverage policies on access,  		quality, and costs?</i></b> The BBA post-acute care provisions did not  		extensively address eligibility and coverage policies. Because eligibility and  		coverage rules are potentially very powerful policy levers, they are likely to  		receive future legislative attention, either to improve the efficiency with  		which post-acute care services are delivered or at least to capture additional  		Medicare savings. As witnessed by changes in the past, any eligibility and  		coverage policy changes are likely to have important effects on access to  		post-acute care services.</p>
<p><i><b>Is integration of services on the basis of a "patient-centered"  		payment system a solution for Medicare post-acute care?</b></i> Despite the  		major payment reforms mandated by the BBA, some observers note that "Medicare  		will have to make comprehensive structural changes to its benefit and payment  		policies" to improve the coordination of services and contain costs in the long  		run. One strategy that has been considered by HCFA is an integrated payment  		system that is "patient-centered." In this type of system, payments would be  		based on the type and intensity of services needed to achieve optimal outcomes,  		regardless of provider category. This system is conceptually appealing and may  		be a desirable goal for reforming payment of Medicare post-acute care services.  		But the urgency and speed with which this strategy is pursued depend on several  		practical issues.</p>
<p>First, a major motivation behind the strategy is the notion that  		Medicare beneficiaries with similar needs receive post-acute care services from  		different providers at different costs to Medicare. To the extent that the  		patient populations are substantially different across post-acute care  		providers, the need for an integrated payment system becomes less urgent.  		Second, there is a paucity of information on quality outcomes associated with  		use of post-acute care. But the level of effort and time required to analyze  		jointly patient characteristics, amount and types of services, and  		outcome-based quality measures is substantial. Thus as a practical matter, an  		integrated payment system that includes quality outcomes may be able to cover  		only a portion of the Medicare post-acute care population. Third, assuming that  		normative payments for post-acute care could be developed for specific groups  		of patients, decisions have to be made about how the post-acute care payment  		will be administered. Assignment of the episode payment for post-acute care to  		any single entity will be controversial and politically sensitive, because of  		the potential impact of any particular choice on the multiplicity of acute and  		post-acute care providers.</p>
<h2><a name="secI" id="secI">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Medicare, which insures over 38 million elderly and disabled people,  		provides coverage for beneficiaries to access physician, hospital, skilled  		nursing facility (SNF), home health, hospice, and various therapy services, as  		well as medical equipment. Although hospital care, which is used by 20 percent  		of beneficiaries each year, continues to be the single most expensive component  		of Medicare, recuperative or rehabilitative services provided to people after  		acute-care hospital stays are the fastest growing. Approximately one-quarter of  		Medicare beneficiaries who enter acute-care hospitals are subsequently  		discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities, SNFs, or home health care  		providers (Gage, 1998). In addition to post-acute care services covered in such  		settings, a small number of beneficiaries are admitted to long-term care  		hospitals for both acute and post-acute care.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note1"><font>1</font></a></sup> Post-acute care is also provided in various  		outpatient settings (e.g., comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities),  		but these account for only a small share of Medicare post-acute care  		expenditures.</p>
<p>Until the mid 1980s, post-acute care accounted for only a small  		percentage of total Medicare expenditures and was viewed as a cost-effective  		and less intensive alternative to extended acute-care hospital stays. After  		implementation of Medicare's acute-care hospital prospective payment system  		(PPS) in 1984, however, Medicare spending for post-acute care services began to  		grow rapidly. Medicare payments for SNFs and home health care, for example,  		shot up from $2.5 billion in 1986 to 12 times that much in 1996. Not  		surprisingly, the supply of each type of post-acute care grew  		commensurately.</p>
<p>The rapid increase in post-acute expenditures catalyzed concern among  		policy makers that use of these services had become excessive and did not  		necessarily improve the health of Medicare beneficiaries. Acting on these  		concerns, Congress and the administration enacted provisions in the 1997  		Balanced Budget Act (BBA) mandating--among other things--prospective payment  		systems for SNFs, home health care, and rehabilitation facilities to curb  		future spending.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note2"><font>2</font></a></sup> These  		provisions represent a major policy response to the expenditure trends.</p>
<p>They do not address many extant cost, quality, and access concerns about  		Medicare's post-acute care services, however. A major one is that differences  		among the various types of post-acute care providers--in services offered,  		service intensity, and types of patients served--are becoming less distinct,  		even though Medicare payment, eligibility, coverage, and certification policies  		for each type of provider continue to differ. Patients with similar needs may  		be receiving similar types and intensity of services for which Medicare is  		paying different amounts depending on the care setting. Patients may also be  		receiving amounts of care reflecting the coverage policies of their providers  		rather than the services required by their medical condition. Despite these  		concerns about overlap in services and patients among the diverse providers of  		post-acute care services, we currently have very little information about its  		extent. Although SNFs, home health care, rehabilitation facilities, and  		long-term care hospitals all provide skilled or general nursing and various  		rehabilitation services, at least some of the differences between them may  		reflect differences in the average intensity of particular services provided.  		Compounding the problem, we do not currently have necessary information on  		post-acute care settings that produce optimal outcomes for different types of  		patient conditions.</p>
<p>A second concern is that current policies give providers incentives to  		discharge patients for financial rather than quality of care reasons. For  		example, SNFs have an incentive to discharge patients when coverage limits of  		100 days in SNFs are exceeded. Hence, the system may be forcing Medicare  		beneficiaries who need post-acute care to use multiple providers during a  		single episode of illness, resulting in higher Medicare costs but not  		necessarily better outcomes. In addition, if the BBA-mandated PPSs do not  		adequately adjust for patients' health conditions, problems with access to  		appropriate post-acute care can be expected, most likely for the sickest and  		most disabled beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the  		Department of Health and Human Services sponsored a study (of which this is the  		first report) of the changing environment of Medicare's post-acute care  		benefit. The goals of the first part of the study are to identify the extent to  		which current research can address relevant questions and to identify areas  		that require further research. The goal of the second part of the study is to  		elucidate--through discussions with knowledgeable individuals in government,  		research, provider, and consumer communities--ongoing issues regarding Medicare  		post-acute care services, and alternative solutions for future reform  		efforts.</p>
<p>Information in this report is based on reviews of published and  		unpublished research, Medicare policy documents, and primary data analysis  		completed at the Urban Institute for related projects. We focus on SNFs, home  		health, rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care hospitals--the four major  		providers of Medicare post-acute care services--and address the following  		issues:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Growth in utilization and expenditures for post-acute care services,  			 changes in Medicare policies that have contributed to those trends, and  			 increases in post-acute care spending relative to those of other Medicare  			 services, in particular inpatient hospital care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth and distribution of the diverse post-acute care services  			 providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factors that differentiate the use of one type of provider relative  			 to others, including characteristics of beneficiaries, providers, and market  			 areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy and analytic issues relevant to Medicare post-acute care  			 services reform.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="secII" id="secII">II. TRENDS IN UTILIZATION AND EXPENDITURES</a></h2>
<p>The rapid growth in post-acute care expenditures, which has slowed down  		very recently but is still substantially higher than the 8 percent annual  		growth rates averaged by other parts of Medicare, characterized all types of  		post-acute providers, and has substantially changed the distribution of total  		Medicare spending.</p>
<p><b>Post-acute Medicare spending growth</b>. The past decade's growth in  		Medicare's payments for and availability of post-acute care services has been  		extraordinary. Payments to SNFs and home health providers have grown at double  		digit rates since the late 1980s, averaging 35 percent a year for SNFs and 25  		percent for home health care. SNF payments rose from $2.5 billion to $11.7  		billion between 1990 and 1996. Home health payments grew from $3.9 billion to  		over $18.3 billion during the same period (ProPAC, 1997). Payments to  		rehabilitation facilities and long-term care hospitals rose on average about 25  		percent and 30 percent a year, respectively, between 1990 and 1994 (ProPAC,  		1996).</p>
<p>For SNF growth, a driving force has been increasing numbers of users.  		Between 1990 and 1996, the number of people using SNFs nearly doubled (from  		638,000 to 1.1 million) and the total number of days covered increased from  		25.1 million to 40.2 million (<a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table1">Table 1</a>). Days per user  		declined, however, from 39.4 to 35.1 (ProPAC, 1997). Much of the early growth  		in SNF spending was due to changes in coverage guidelines that led to fewer  		coverage denials. More recently, however, growth in SNF payments also has been  		affected by increased provision of ancillary services, such as therapy. Part A  		payments for SNF ancillary services (e.g., therapies, medications) represent a  		substantial part of total SNF spending, accounting for almost half of SNF  		payments in the mid 1990s (CBO, 1995). This increase does not include payments  		for therapy services to SNF patients made under the Medicare Part B insurance,  		which are excluded from SNF spending estimates.</p>

</tr></table><p>Growth in home health has been fueled by both increasing numbers of  		users <i>and</i> increased number of visits per user. Between 1990-96, the  		number of home health care users nearly doubled (from 1.9 million to 3.7  		million) and the annual utilization rate rose from 57 users per 1,000 enrollees  		to 98 per 1,000. During the same period, the number of visits per user <i>more  		than doubled</i>, from 36 to 77 visits per user per year (see <a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table1">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p>Spending for rehabilitation facility services doubled between 1990 and  		1994 (from $1.9 billion to $3.9 billion). The growth in number of users was  		almost as high, increasing from 172,000 discharges in 1990 to 288,000 in 1996.  		Payments for long-term care hospitals quadrupled between 1990 and 1994  		(increasing from $200 million to $800 million). The number of discharges per  		year slightly more than doubled (increasing from 17,000 to 36,000) (ProPAC,  		1997).</p>
<p><b>Medicare spending shifts</b>. This growth in post-acute care  		utilization has shifted the distribution of total Medicare payments. For SNF  		and home health services, Medicare payments grew from 3 percent of all Medicare  		expenditures in 1986 to 15 percent in 1996. The share of hospital expenditures  		declined from 61 percent to 49 percent of all Medicare expenditures.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note3"><font>3</font></a></sup> This shift toward post-acute  		care providers is due to multiple factors. First, implementation of Medicare's  		acute-care hospital prospective payment system in 1984, with its fixed payments  		per stay, provided strong incentives to discharge patients as quickly as  		possible, thereby increasing the number of people needing post-hospital  		recuperation or rehabilitation in other settings. Second, changes in technology  		allowed more complex services to be delivered in less intensive settings.  		Third, and perhaps most important, changes in Medicare eligibility and coverage  		guidelines in the late 1980s increased access to SNFs and home health care  		(ProPAC, 1995).</p>
<p>The shift in Medicare spending toward post-acute care is highlighted by  		the increasing proportions of total Medicare payment growth accounted for by  		post-acute care services. <a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table2">Table 2</a> shows increases in  		Medicare spending for three periods: 1974-83 (pre-acute-hospital PPS), 1983-90  		(implementation of acute-care hospital PPS), and 1990-95 (after full  		implementation of acute-care hospital PPS<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note4"><font>4</font></a></sup>).

</tr></table><p>The bottom panel shows the share of the increases coming from inpatient  		hospitals and SNF/home health care, respectively. Hospital inpatient payments  		accounted for 63.5 percent of the growth in total Medicare payments between  		1974 and 1983, while SNF and home health services accounted for only 3.5  		percent of spending growth. After hospital PPS was implemented, hospital  		payments as a proportion of total Medicare spending growth declined, while  		SNF/home health care spending growth increased. In the most recent period,  		1990-95, inpatient hospital services accounted for 38.6 percent of the growth  		in total Medicare payments, while SNF/home health care payments accounted for  		almost as much (30 percent). It is important to recall that these figures  		<i>overstate</i> the growth in hospital inpatient spending and understate  		growth in post-acute care, because spending for rehabilitation facilities and  		long-term care hospitals is included in the hospital inpatient category.</p>
<p>As <a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table2">Table 2</a> clearly shows, SNF and home health care  		spending has become an important component of growth in total Medicare  		expenditures. It is also interesting to note from <a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table2">Table 2</a>  		that combined inpatient hospital and SNF/home health care spending accounted  		for almost the same proportion (67 percent versus 68.6 percent) of total  		Medicare spending growth before acute-care hospital PPS was implemented as in  		the most recent period. It is appealing to speculate that much of the increased  		spending for SNF and home health services has simply displaced the spending for  		in-hospital acute care that would have occurred in the absence of PPS. More  		rigorous analysis is required, of course, before any fair inference can be  		drawn. But we leave this finding as a beacon to guide future research on  		potential substitution between hospital inpatient acute-care and post-acute  		care of some type.</p>
<h2><a name="secIII" id="secIII">III. MEDICARE POLICIES FOR POST-ACUTE CARE</a></h2>
<p>Although the immediate cause of the dramatically increased Medicare  		spending for post-acute care is increased use, a major underlying reason is  		modification in the policies governing Medicare post-acute benefits. It is  		important to understand that each type of provider is governed by different  		Medicare policies, and that these differences affect the distribution of use  		among the different types of providers.</p>
<p>In this section we look first at eligibility, coverage, cost sharing,  		and provider certification. We then review payment policy. Interestingly,  		although the first four policy parameters have had major impacts on Medicare  		post-acute care use patterns, the BBA focused primarily on payment reform.</p>
<h3>A. Eligibility, Coverage, Cost Sharing, and Provider  		Certification<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note5"><font>5</font></a></sup></h3>
<p>Of the four types of policy covered in this subsection, eligibility and  		coverage changes have been by far the most dramatic. Changes in eligibility and  		coverage of SNF and home health care, indeed, have transformed Medicare's  		post-acute benefits. Changes in cost sharing and provider certification have  		played a considerably smaller role.</p>
<p><b><i>Skilled Nursing Facilities</i></b></p>
<p>Current eligibility for the SNF benefit is restricted to persons who  		have had a hospital stay of at least three days in the past 30-day period.  		Coverage is limited to a maximum of 100 days for each spell of illness. There  		is no deductible for SNF care. But after the first 20 days of a stay, a daily  		coinsurance payment ($95.50 in 1998) is required of the beneficiary. In  		addition to these eligibility, coverage, and cost-sharing provisions, SNFs must  		have a transfer agreement with a hospital to accept patients recommended for  		SNF care; sufficient staff to provide 24-hour nursing services; a physician who  		supervises patient care and is available 24 hours a day on an emergency basis;  		and dietary, pharmaceutical, dental, and medical social services available.</p>
<p>In response to the expenditure increases in all types of post-acute  		care, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) sought to control the  		trend by increasing the stringency with which Medicare's fiscal intermediaries  		(FIs) scrutinized claims.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note6"><font>6</font></a></sup> With respect to SNF claims, this led to a widely  		prevailing practice of developing "rules of thumb" to make coverage  		determinations, which reduced the need for detailed claim review on an  		individual basis.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note7"><font>7</font></a></sup> This  		increasing FI arbitrariness drew the attention of advocacy groups, providers,  		and government agencies--and ultimately led to a court decision mandating  		change in the interpretation of the Medicare SNF benefit.</p>
<p>In 1986, as a result of <i>Fox v. Bowen</i>, FIs were expressly  		forbidden from using rules of thumb to deny coverage. Further, they were not  		permitted to deny any physician-ordered SNF (or home health) care--even if such  		care was only maintenance therapy--without providing specific clinical evidence  		about why a particular service should not be covered. The clinical evidence  		requirement made it much more difficult, as well as more costly, for FIs to  		deny claims (Leaf and Uili, 1990).</p>
<p>The response was predictable. In September 1988, the denial rate for SNF  		claims was 16.8 percent. In 1989 and 1990 the denial rates were 11.3 percent  		and 12.3 percent, respectively (Manard, Fama, and McParltlin, 1990). Between  		1988 and 1996, SNF Medicare expenditures increased from $0.9 billion to $11.7  		billion and utilization increased from 12 users per 1,000 enrollees to 30  		(ProPAC, 1997).</p>
<p><b><i>Home Health</i></b></p>
<p>Currently, Medicare provides home health benefits to beneficiaries who  		require intermittent or part-time skilled nursing care and therapy services,  		and who are homebound, defined flexibly to include individuals who  		"occasionally leave the home." These services must be prescribed (and  		re-certified every 62 days) by a physician. But there is no prior  		hospitalization requirement or limit on the number of visits a person may  		receive. Nor is there any copayment or deductible associated with home health  		visits (although persons receiving durable medical equipment, for example, are  		responsible for a 20 percent copayment).</p>
<p>Prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980 (OBRA 1980), the  		home health benefit was split between Medicare's Part A and Part B, with each  		component subject to different coverage and payment requirements. Both Part A  		and B home health benefits were subject to 100-visit limits. The Part A benefit  		required a prior hospital stay (of at least three days). No cost sharing was  		required for post-hospital benefits under Part A, but coinsurance was required  		under Part B (until repealed in 1972).</p>
<p>OBRA 1980 liberalized the home health benefit, while effectively  		consolidating it under Part A. The three-day prior hospitalization requirement  		and 100-visit limit were removed and for-profit home health agencies were  		allowed to become Medicare-certified, even in states that did not license  		proprietary agencies. By 1983, Medicare home health expenditures had increased  		to $1.4 billion, from $726 million in 1980. Utilization had increased to 45  		users per 1,000 enrollees, from 34 in 1980. And the number of visits per user  		had increased to 27 per person, from 23 in 1980 (ProPAC, 1994).</p>
<p>Partly because of these increases, and partly because of reports that  		the home health benefit was being delivered to ineligible individuals (Kenney  		and Moon, 1997), HCFA issued new administrative instructions to Medicare's  		fiscal intermediaries (FIs) to control home health utilization more tightly.  		Home health care could now be provided only on a part-time (less than eight  		hours a day) <i>and</i> intermittent (four or fewer days a week) basis, and  		only to persons who were absolutely homebound.</p>
<p>Despite the concurrent introduction of hospital PPS, which could have  		been expected to increase home health expenditures with its incentive for rapid  		discharge, the new instructions proved effective in controlling home health  		care costs. FI denial rates for Medicare's home health benefit increased from  		2.5 percent in 1984 to 7.9 percent in 1988. Utilization peaked in 1985 at 51  		users per 1,000 enrollees and then dropped to 48 per 1,000 by 1987. Visits per  		user had dropped back to the 1980 level by 1987. And annual expenditure growth  		slowed to 6.8 percent in 1987 from the 1980-1983 average annual rate of 18  		percent (ProPAC, 1994).</p>
<p>As in the case of the SNF benefit, a court ruling (<i>Duggan v.  		Bowen</i>) forced HCFA to revise the eligibility and coverage guidelines for  		home health. Effective July 1, 1989 HCFA changed the benefit language to  		include home health care that was part-time <i>or</i> intermittent, clarified  		the meaning of the term <i>intermittent</i> to mean up to 28 hours per week of  		skilled nursing and aide services with up to 35 hours available upon review,  		and liberalized <i>homebound</i> to include individuals who occasionally leave  		the home. Patients now also qualified for skilled observation if a reasonable  		potential for complications or possible need to change treatment existed--a  		reform that allowed those with stable health needs to become eligible. Need for  		skilled observation, in turn, qualified the individual for the home health  		benefit. In addition, the home health benefit now allowed for therapy services  		simply to maintain function, whereas the previous criterion required that  		patients show improvement from such services (U.S. GAO, 1996). These revisions  		made it harder for FIs to deny claims, made new groups of beneficiaries  		eligible for services, and made it possible for beneficiaries to receive more  		services.</p>
<p>Home health utilization and expenditures responded quickly to the  		liberalized coverage guidelines. Between 1988 and 1996, Medicare home health  		spending increased from $1.9 billion to $17.2 billion. This annual growth rate  		of nearly 37 percent was more than three times the growth rate for the rest of  		the Medicare program. Over the same period, service utilization increased from  		48 users per 1,000 enrollees and 23 visits per user to 98 per 1,000 enrollees  		and 77 visits per user (ProPAC, 1997).</p>
<p><b><i>Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care Hospitals</i></b></p>
<p>Eligibility for both rehabilitation and long-term care hospital benefits  		from Medicare is physician-determined. Rehabilitation hospitals must  		demonstrate that 75 percent of their patients have at least one of ten specific  		conditions--nine related to neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, plus  		burns. Patients must require frequent physician involvement, 24-hour  		rehabilitation nursing, generally at least three hours of therapy a day, and a  		coordinated group of skilled professionals. In order for Medicare to cover  		rehabilitation hospital services, patients are expected to improve as a result  		of therapy. For long-term care hospital admission, Medicare coverage for  		inpatient services is included under the basic Part A hospital benefit.</p>
<p>Both types of hospitals also have a deductible of $764 for each spell of  		illness (the same as for the Medicare benefit for an acute care hospital) and a  		daily coinsurance rate of $191 after the first 60 days. </p>
<p>Both types of hospitals also have the same maximum length of stay--90  		days per spell of illness. To remain certified, rehabilitation hospitals must  		demonstrate that 75 percent of their patients do indeed receive three hours of  		therapy a day. Long-term care hospitals must preserve an average length of stay  		of at least 25 days.</p>
<p>All post-acute care providers, except SNFs, may be deemed to meet  		certification requirements by a national accreditation body found to have  		requirements that meet or exceed Medicare conditions of participation. The  		Health Care Financing Administration has recommended against deemed status for  		SNFs, in part because accrediting organizations were found not to have  		comparable standards and processes. In addition, others have expressed concern  		about permitting deemed status in these settings because of the nature of  		services provided (e.g., minimal physician involvement) and vulnerability of  		patients served.</p>

<p>Cost-related reimbursement survived in the Medicare program for  		post-acute care until passage of the BBA of 1997. That legislation mandated  		establishment of prospective payment systems, on a phased-in schedule, for all  		types of post-acute care providers. For SNF implementation, the phase-in period  		was specified as July 1998 through 2001. For home health care, PPS was  		originally specified to begin in October 1999. Public pressure to reopen the  		issue and administrative delays have since led to postponement of initial  		implementation until the year 2000, with a possible transition period of up to  		four years. For rehabilitation hospitals, the phase-in period was specified as  		October 2000 through 2002. For long-term care hospitals, the legislation called  		for a PPS proposal to be developed by October 1999 with no specified phase-in  		schedule.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that the type of PPS expected for  		post-acute care providers differs from the system implemented for acute  		inpatient hospitals in a way that affects provider incentives. For inpatient  		hospitals, the reimbursement rate is based on per-episode payments. Such a  		system, by putting providers at risk for total costs of an entire episode,  		provides incentives to limit both the price and quantity of services. Its  		built-in incentive to discharge patients as quickly as possible, however,  		raised concerns that quality of care could be jeopardized. Various studies of  		the effects of hospital PPS (e.g., Des Harnais et al., 1987) suggested,  		however, that PPS, while reducing hospital use, did not produce deterioration  		in the quality of care.</p>
<p>The PPS system for SNFs is based on per diem payments, and per diem  		systems are anticipated for rehabilitation hospitals and long-term care  		hospitals. Such systems help contain costs by establishing unit prices for  		services in advance but do not give providers an incentive to limit the number  		of units delivered. Both per diem and per episode payments will require  		safeguards to monitor potential threats to quality of care created by financial  		incentives inherent in either approach. A key issue is whether one system is  		more amenable to monitoring potential quality impacts.</p>
<p>The BBA provisions for each major type of post-acute provider are  		discussed in turn, followed by a brief review of the BBA's post-acute hospital  		transfer policy, which can also be expected to affect utilization.</p>
<p><b><i>Skilled Nursing Facilities</i></b></p>
<p>Prior to the BBA, Medicare reimbursed SNFs on three different bases,  		depending on three components of costs. In general, routine operating services  		were paid on an actual cost basis up to a per diem limit, ancillary services  		were paid on a reasonable cost basis, and capital was paid on a pass-through  		basis. Separate cost limits applied to hospital-based and freestanding SNFs,  		and to urban and rural SNFs.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note8"><font>8</font></a></sup> New providers were exempt from these limits for  		the first three years of operation. And facilities could receive exceptions  		payments if they could demonstrate that their Medicare patients casemix was  		sufficiently higher than average to warrant higher payments.</p>
<p>Ancillary services costs constituted a growing share of SNF expenditures  		and amounted to about half of all SNF payments in 1995 (CBO, 1995). This trend  		is not surprising, since ancillary services were not subject to a per-diem cost  		limit and, though subject to medical necessity criteria, were rarely reviewed  		by Medicare (U.S. GAO, 1996). Most ancillary services were reimbursed under  		Medicare Part A. But if they were not directly furnished by the SNF or if  		patients were not covered by Part A, ancillary services could be reimbursed  		under Medicare Part B. One study estimated that, in 1992, approximately 15  		percent of therapy charges provided to SNF patients were billed to Part B (Liu,  		1993). In general, however, discontinuities in Part A and Part B accounting  		systems meant that Medicare could not readily monitor total program spending  		for SNF patients.</p>
<p>The BBA moved SNFs into a per diem, prospective payment system that  		covers routine, ancillary and capital costs, including items and services for  		which payment had previously been made under Part B, with a few exceptions  		(e.g., physician and psychologist services). Under the new system, a SNF  		receives a payment that is derived from a blend of (a) a casemix-adjusted  		Federal rate and (b) a facility-specific rate based on the facility's  		historical costs. This blend will change over a three-year period in a way that  		weights the Federal rate ever more heavily--with payments reflecting 25 percent  		of the Federal rate in the first year, 50 percent in the second year, 75  		percent in the third year, and 100 percent thereafter.</p>
<p><i>The Federal rate</i> is set at a level equal to a weighted mean of  		freestanding facility costs plus 50 percent of the difference between the  		freestanding mean and a weighted mean of all SNFs' (hospital-based and  		freestanding) costs. Separate rates were derived for SNFs in urban and rural  		areas, and further adjustments were made for geographic variations in wage  		rates and casemix. The Federal rates are also adjusted to account for a  		facility's casemix using a resident classification system (Resource Utilization  		Groups III). Exception payments for casemix are eliminated from the Federal  		rate.</p>
<p><i>Facility-specific rates</i> are based on fiscal year 1995 cost  		reports, trended forward. Those rates are updated from 1995 by the SNF market  		basket percentage increase minus one percentage point. Included in the  		facility-specific per diem rate is an estimate of the amount payable under Part  		B for covered SNF services furnished during fiscal year 1995. In contrast to  		the Federal rates, facility-specific rates include exceptions to the routine  		cost limits.</p>
<p>The BBA also provided for a consolidated billing measure. This is  		interpreted to mean that essentially all Medicare claims for services delivered  		in the SNF--including those billed under Part B--be submitted by the SNF,  		regardless of whether the service was provided by in-house staff or external  		entities (e.g., independent therapists).<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note9"><font>9</font></a></sup> Consolidated billing requirements are effective  		for SNF residents whose stays are covered under Part A. These measures were  		intended to secure a full accounting for all costs associated with treating  		Medicare beneficiaries in the facilities, thus providing an incentive to limit  		the previously unrestrained growth in ancillary services.</p>
<p>The SNF PPS and consolidated billing measures have raised numerous  		questions, which HCFA is currently exploring, including whether payments for  		non-therapy ancillary services were set appropriately.</p>
<p><b><i>Home Health</i></b></p>
<p>Prior to the BBA, home health agencies were paid on a retrospective  		cost-related basis, subject to limits established at 112 percent of the mean  		cost per visit for freestanding agencies. Rural agencies received an extra  		payment. Cost limits were determined separately by type of visit and were  		updated annually using the latest available market basket to reflect cost  		increases (except for the labor-related portion of the payment limit, which was  		adjusted by the current hospital wage index). Each agency was also subject to  		an aggregate cost limit equal to the limit for each type of service multiplied  		by the number of visits of each type provided by that agency. There used to be  		an additional adjustment for hospital-based home health agencies, but this was  		removed several years ago.</p>
<p>The BBA required that a home health PPS go into effect in October, 1999  		and mandated an interim payment system (IPS) to capture Medicare savings until  		PPS implementation. Since then the implementation date has been extended to the  		year 2000 and the IPS has been revised.</p>
<p>The original IPS modified Medicare's home health payment method in two  		ways. First, it reduced the national cost limits for each type of service, from  		112 percent of the average cost per visit to 105 percent of the median cost per  		visit. Second, it added a new criterion to the payment formula: an average per  		beneficiary expenditure limit. Agency payments are now based on the lowest of  		(a) actual costs, (b) the aggregate cost limits, or (c) the per beneficiary  		expenditure limit.</p>
<p>This new limit is based on 98 percent of the 1994 average per patient  		expenditures for each agency and the region. Seventy-five percent of the  		agency's historical costs are blended with 25 percent of the average regional  		expenditures to allow payments to reflect both agency-specific historical  		case-mix differences and variations in local practice patterns. Such a blend  		allows agencies with high cost patients to have a higher limit while moderating  		it with regional levels. Agencies with high costs in 1994 will have higher cost  		limits than agencies that had lower costs in 1994. Agencies that had lower cost  		patients in 1994 will face more restrictive limits in 1998 if their patient  		population grows sicker or if they start treating more chronic care patients  		needing higher numbers of aide visits (Gage, 1999).</p>
<p>In addition to general concerns about the new home health care  		cost-containment provisions in the IPS, two issues raised particular  		controversy, with anecdotal evidence quoted to support the arguments against  		them. The first was retroactive implementation. Although the final regulations  		were not issued until August 1998, the IPS rates were applied to all payments  		starting October 1, 1997. Since agencies had already estimated their expected  		payments under the old system and planned their behavior accordingly, there  		were many claims that retroactive applications had led to forced service  		reductions and even agency closings. The second issue was lack of legislative  		attention to factors that could lead to lower payments following enactment of  		the BBA. Specifically, agencies might face smaller increases in payment rates  		over time and possibly even lower absolute payments.</p>
<p>Spurred by advocates for the elderly, people with disabilities, and home  		health providers, the 105th Congress held hearings to revisit the IPS issues.  		The potential need to reform the IPS (rather than concentrate on the planned  		PPS system) took on added importance as a result of HCFA's announcement that  		year 2000 computer issues would further delay implementation of several BBA  		provisions, including the home health PPS. These delays--which HCFA said were  		necessary to ensure delivery of even routine Medicare services--would leave the  		IPS for home health in effect until October 1, 2000.</p>
<p>Congress made minor adjustments to the IPS for home health agencies in  		the 1998 omnibus appropriations legislation. It increased the beneficiary per  		visit limit from 105 percent to 106 percent of the national median. It  		increased beneficiary limits for older agencies. It set per beneficiary limits  		for newer agencies at the national payment median and, for start-up agencies  		(in 1998), at 75 percent of the national median. Finally, the legislation  		delayed a 15 percent payment reduction scheduled to take effect October 1, 1999  		by one year, to coincide with the revised implementation schedule for the home  		health PPS.</p>
<p><b><i>Rehabilitation Facilities and Long-Term Care Hospitals</i></b></p>
<p>Rehabilitation facilities and long-term care hospitals have been paid  		historically on a cost-related basis subject to per discharge (case) limits.  		(They were excluded from the hospital PPS implemented in 1984.) The Tax Equity  		and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) established inpatient,  		facility-specific payment limits equal to the product of the facility's base  		year costs per discharge updated to the current year and its total discharges.  		A facility with operating costs below its payment limit ceiling received its  		costs plus an incentive payment equal to the lower of (a) 50 percent of the  		difference between the ceiling and its costs or (b) 5 percent of the ceiling.  		Facilities with costs above the target were paid the ceiling plus 50 percent of  		the difference between the ceiling and its costs up to a maximum of 110 percent  		of the ceiling. New providers were exempt from the payment ceilings for the  		first three years of operation. Facilities could also request exceptions if  		their costs were above the target payments. Capital costs were paid on a  		pass-through basis, subject to certain limitations.</p>
<p>Paying hospitals on the basis of per capita spending in a base year  		raised concerns that high-cost patients would have access problems once a  		provider's TEFRA limit was set. In addition, relying on spending in a base year  		created inequities between older and newer providers. Many have expressed  		concern that the financial incentives inherent in Medicare's payment policy  		disadvantage older providers relative to new providers.</p>
<p>Three provisions in the BBA were included to address the inequity  		created as a result of setting limits based on each provider's base year.  		First, the BBA changes incentives for new providers by limiting payment to the  		lesser of the provider's costs or 110 percent of the national median target  		amount for that class of providers (e.g., rehabilitation facilities). Second,  		it permits providers with base years beginning before October 1990 to rebase  		using their average costs from three recent cost reporting periods. Third, the  		BBA limits facility target amounts to the 75th percentile of the 1996 target  		amounts, adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>The BBA further modified rehabilitation hospital payments by  		establishing a PPS for them that is to be phased in between October 2000 and  		the end of September 2002. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has broad  		discretion in the design of this system, subject to the following Congressional  		mandates: (1) to establish classes of patient groups and develop a method of  		assigning specific patients from rehabilitation facilities within these groups;  		(2) to assign each casemix group an appropriate weighting that reflects the  		relative facility resources used by a group; and (3) to determine a prospective  		payment rate for each Medicare rehabilitation facility patient.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note10"><font>10</font></a></sup></p>
<p>The phase-in will be accomplished by blending the TEFRA-based hospital's  		target amount that would have been paid under Medicare Part A and the payment  		rate established by the Secretary. The blend would be two-thirds the TEFRA rate  		in the first year, and one-third in the second year. The PPS would be fully  		implemented by October 2002. During the phase-in period, the prospective  		payment amounts are to be kept budget neutral by setting total payments for  		rehabilitation hospitals equal to 98 percent of the payments that would have  		been made if the PPS had not been enacted.</p>
<p>For long-term care hospitals, the BBA required the Secretary to collect  		data to develop, establish, administer, and evaluate a casemix-adjusted PPS. A  		legislative proposal is also to be developed for establishing and administering  		a payment system that includes a patient classification system that adequately  		reflects differences in patient resource use. This proposal is to be submitted  		to Congress by October 1, 1999.</p>
<p><b><i>Hospital Transfer Policy</i></b></p>
<p>As of October 1, 1998 the BBA required that hospital discharges falling  		within ten specific DRGs and having lengths of stay below the national average  		for those DRGs will be treated as a transfer for payment purposes. The  		provision applies to patients transferred from a PPS hospital to a PPS-exempt  		hospital or unit, SNF, or home health care. Hospital payments will be based on  		Medicare's current per diem rate policies affecting transfers between PPS acute  		care hospitals -with a transfer defined as any patient discharged with one of  		the ten DRGs that is admitted to a post-acute care provider within the next  		three days.</p>
<p>As implemented by HCFA, the 10 DRGs for which the transfer policy  		applies are strokes (DRG 14), amputations (DRG 113), major joint procedures  		(DRG 209), other hip and femur procedures (DRGs 210 and 211), hip fractures  		(DRG 236), skin grafts (DRGs 263 and 264), organic disturbances and mental  		retardation (DRG 429), and tracheostomies (DRG 483) (U.S. GPO, 1998).</p>
<h2><a name="secIV" id="secIV">IV. THE SUPPLY AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF POST-ACUTE  		CARE PROVIDERS</a></h2>
<p>The enormous increase in the supply of all types of post-acute care  		providers has already been noted. In this section, we provide more detail on  		this increase in supply, followed by a discussion of the regional distribution  		of provider types and their use. Since the distribution of post-acute care  		needs among beneficiaries is unlikely to differ substantially by region, any  		large differences in these distributions by area of the country at least  		suggest that there might be casemix overlap among provider types.</p>
<p><b><i>Supply Increases</i></b></p>
<p>All major types of post-acute providers experienced double-digit growth  		between 1990 and 1996 (<a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table3">Table 3</a>). The supply of SNFs  		overall increased from just over 10,500 to 15,000 (48 percent), with the supply  		of hospital-based SNFs growing much faster (82 percent) and the supply of  		swing-bed hospitals much slower (11 percent) than the overall average. The  		supply of home health care providers grew by 71 percent over the period, with  		the supply of freestanding providers growing slightly faster than the supply of  		hospital-based providers. Rehabilitation facilities grew at an overall rate of  		29 percent over the period, with rehabilitation hospitals growing at 40 percent  		compared with 27 percent for distinct-part units. Distinct-part units still  		account for the great majority (about 85 percent of the total), however. The  		supply of long-term care hospitals more than doubled, from 90 to 185.</p>
<p><b><i>Distribution of Providers and Ownership, by Region</i></b></p>
<p><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table4">Table 4</a> shows the distribution of  		Medicare-certified providers by region, with the distribution of Medicare  		beneficiaries for comparison. If patient condition were the only factor driving  		the distribution, one would expect the percentages of each type of provider to  		more or less match the percentage of beneficiaries in an area. For the Mountain  		region, this is very roughly what we find. For the other regions, however,  		there are differences worthy of note. West South Central, with 9.7 percent of  		the beneficiaries, has higher proportions than that of all post-acute provider  		categories, but enormously higher shares of home health providers (27.4  		percent) and long-term care hospitals (30.8 percent). South Atlantic, with 18.8  		percent of beneficiaries, has less than its fair share of all types of  		post-acute facilities, but most underrepresented are home health care providers  		(11.4 percent).</p>
<p>With respect to provider ownership (not shown), there are also  		substantial differences across the country. Over 80 percent of SNFs in  		Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas are for profit, for example, compared with only  		11 percent in North Dakota (AHCA, 1997).</p>
<p>For home health care, ownership has been shifting over time. In 1989,  		for example, 25 percent of home health agencies were government-owned, 35  		percent for-profit, and 39 percent not-for- profit. By 1994, there had been a  		considerable shift toward for-profit ownership, with 17 percent government, 49  		percent for-profit, and 34 percent not-for-profit (U.S. GAO, 1996). As in the  		case of SNFs, the ownership distribution differs substantially by region. Data  		for 1994 indicate that in New England, ownership was 5 percent government, 35  		percent for-profit, and 60 percent not-for-profit. In the West South Central  		region, the distribution leans much more heavily toward for-profit status, with  		13 percent government, 67 percent for-profit, and 20 percent  		not-for-profit.</p>
<p>For rehabilitation hospitals, according to 1994 data, the distribution  		of ownership was 4 percent government, 62 percent for-profit, and 33 percent  		not-for-profit. For distinct-part units, the ownership distribution was 14  		percent government, 13 percent for-profit, and 73 percent not-for-profit.</p>
<p>For long-term care hospitals, 1994 data show 34 percent government, 36  		percent for-prpofit, and 30 percent not-for-profit (ProPAC, 1996). This  		represents a significant change from 1988--when the ownership was split 50-50  		between not-for-profit and government auspices (ProPAC, 1992). The change  		largely reflects the emergence of a single provider, Vencor, Inc., which now  		dominates the market. Further expansion in the supply of long-term care  		hospitals has become more costly due to amendments to the payment rules that  		discourage construction of new facilities (Adams, 1998). But long-term care  		hospitals might still prove attractive for systems that are striving to provide  		a complete continuum of care (i.e., full service integrated systems). And  		long-term care status might also prove an attractive option to solve excess  		capacity problems in the existing supply of acute care hospital beds. Finally,  		long-term care hospitals may be attractive because they are the only post-acute  		care provider for whom a date to implement a prospective payment system has not  		been required by law.</p>

<p>Regional distribution by use (<a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table5">Table 5</a>) is  		generally as expected, given the distribution of provider supply. With respect  		to Medicare beneficiary use of SNFs, the national average is 43.5 discharges  		per 1,000 beneficiaries per year. The regional breakdown shows highest use in  		the West North Central (61.8 per 1,000). This is the region with the highest  		share of SNFs relative to its beneficiary share. New England is next (55.0 per  		1,000), another region where the SNF share is high relative to the beneficiary  		share. All the other regions cluster around the national average except Middle  		and South Atlantic (at 34.7 and 35.8 per 1,000, respectively). Both these  		regions have lower proportions of SNFs than beneficiaries.</p>

</tr></table><p>Home health care use by beneficiaries nationwide averages about 6,100  		visits per 1,000 beneficiaries per year. By far the highest use is in West  		South Central (18,800 visits), which has almost three times as many home health  		providers as would be expected based solely on its share of Medicare  		beneficiaries. Next comes East South Central (11,200 visits), more unexpected  		given that its share of home health care providers just about reflects its  		share of beneficiaries. New England is also above average (7,700 visits) as is  		its share of home health care providers. At the low end of the spectrum are  		Middle Atlantic (3,100) and West North Central (3,000). Middle Atlantic is well  		under the national average in provider supply. But West North Central goes  		against the typical pattern in that it is higher than the national average in  		home health care provider supply.</p>
<p>For rehabilitation hospitals, the national average is 8.8 discharges per  		1,000 beneficiaries per year. Here again there is wide regional variation, from  		a high of 15.0 per 1,000 in West South Central, which has about twice its  		expected share of rehabilitation hospitals, to a low of 4.2 per 1,000 in  		Pacific, with a somewhat lower than expected share of rehabilitation  		hospitals.</p>
<p>For long-term care hospitals, New England has much the highest use (5.1  		per 1,000), and nearly three times its expected share of long-term care  		hospitals. West South Central is next (2.5 per 1,000), and has over three times  		its expected share of long-term care hospitals. Most of the other regions show  		use rates of under 1 discharge per 1,000 beneficiaries. All but one of these  		(Mountain) have considerably smaller than expected shares of long-term care  		hospital supply.</p>
<h2><a name="secV" id="secV">V. CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES OF POST-ACUTE CARE  		USERS</a></h2>
<p>The policy concern that Medicare may be paying different types of  		post-acute care providers differently for patients with similar conditions  		raises important questions. The first is how extensive the patient overlap is  		among the different types of providers. The second, related to the first, is  		the extent to which personal and health status characteristics differentiate  		use of one type of provider relative to others. On the assumption Medicare is  		paying different amounts in cases where similar patients are served by  		different types of post-acute care providers, the third question is the extent  		to which payments are too high or too low for one type of provider relative to  		others, given quality of care considerations. In other words, what are the  		appropriate resources needed to achieve desired outcomes for patients with  		particular needs? A final question is also important: How much do Medicare  		policies affect not only patient outcomes but also provider choice?</p>
<p>The level of detail from many of the data sources permits only  		preliminary inferences about the extent of patient overlap among the providers.  		We know relatively more about the characteristics of individuals served by  		different post-acute care providers. Few studies have compared resource use and  		patient outcomes across post-acute care providers. This section reviews the  		limited evidence, with a focus on factors that differentiate the use of one  		type of provider relative to others. We first examine hospital discharge  		destinations by DRG. We then review research findings on beneficiary, provider,  		and market area characteristics that have been found to be associated with  		post-acute care use. Finally, we highlight findings from the relatively few  		studies that have compared patient outcomes among different types of post-acute  		care providers.</p>
<h3>A. Hospital Discharge Destinations by DRG</h3>
<p>Post-acute care, by definition, is provided after patients are  		discharged from hospital stays. Prior research has examined the discharge  		destination of representative samples of Medicare hospital patients as well as  		persons discharged from hospitals with DRGs that are commonly associated with  		post-acute care use (e.g., strokes, hip fractures). Such studies include large  		scale analyses of Medicare claims data by the RAND Corporation (Steiner and  		Neu, 1993; Neu, Harrison and Heilbrunn, 1989) and the Prospective Payment  		Assessment Commission (ProPAC, 1996), and other analyses using Medicare claims  		data merged with survey data on Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The discharge patterns for post-acute care patients give an initial  		impression of the extent to which patients with the same DRG are served by  		different types of post-acute care providers. This pattern is illustrated in  		<a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table6">Table 6</a>, which presents the distribution of discharge  		destinations for the 32 most prevalent DRGs involving post-PPS acute hospital  		use of SNFs, home health care providers and rehabilitation facilities in  		1995.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note11"><font>11</font></a></sup> The 32 DRGs  		account for 62 percent of all post-acute care episodes.<sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#note12"><font>12</font></a></sup><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table6">Table  		6</a> uses tabulations from related work at the Urban Institute (Gage, 1998).  		For the DRGs taken together, 4 percent of the episodes resulted in the use of  		rehabilitation facilities and no other post-acute care provider. One-quarter of  		the cases involved only SNF use and half involved only home health agency (HHA)  		use. Almost one-fifth of the episodes involved the use of more than one type of  		provider.</p>
<p>The patterns in <a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table6">Table 6</a> indicate that most types  		of post-acute care cases--identified by the DRG of the prior hospital  		stay--appear in the caseloads of all three types of post-acute care providers.  		But some of them are conspicuously absent from the caseload of some provider  		types. For example, less than 1 percent of the episodes with chronic  		obstructive pulmonary disease (DRG 88) received post-acute care in  		rehabilitation facilities. In general, rehabilitation facilities, because of  		their goals and Medicare certification rules, serve primarily post-acute care  		patients who have "rehabilitation DRGs" rather than "medical DRGs." Among the  		more common DRGs found among rehabilitation facilities are stroke (DRG 14),  		procedures related to hip fracture repair (DRGs 209, 210), and back and neck  		procedures (DRGs 214, 215). Although SNFs and home health care providers are  		relatively common sources of post-acute care for most of the DRGs, home health  		agencies tend to have a particularly high prevalence of patients who have  		medical DRGs involving pulmonary or cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#table6">Table 6</a> provides only a broad-brush overview of  		the overlap question, however, primarily because each DRG encompasses a broad  		array of diagnoses, conditions, and co-morbidities within it. In addition, DRG  		information does not reflect personal characteristics of post-acute care  		patients (e.g., age and the availability of able and willing caregivers) that  		may influence the services needed and provider settings used. Recognition of  		the heterogeneous population within DRGs led researchers to examine the effects  		of personal characteristics and other factors that might influence post-acute  		care use of Medicare beneficiaries. Some studies focused on persons with the  		same DRGs.</p>

<p>Prior research has provided generally consistent and logical  		associations between beneficiary, provider, and market area characteristics and  		post-acute care use. The literature on post-acute care use includes findings on  		these groups of factors as they relate to the use particularly of SNFs, home  		health care providers, and rehabilitation facilities. The following sections  		highlight findings from that research, focusing on specific characteristics  		that differentiate the propensity to use one type of provider relative to  		others. More detailed information is presented in <a href="medicares-post-acute-care-benefits-background-trends-and-issues-be-faced.html#appendB">Appendix  		B</a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Personal and Health Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p>The personal and health characteristics found to be associated with  		either use of post-acute care generally, or the propensity to use one type of  		provider relative to others, tend to reflect (a) health or functional status or  		(b) availability of informal care. These two factors, in turn, are logically  		related to some basic differences between the major types of post-acute care  		providers. For example, people who are very frail or disabled may not be able  		to withstand the intensive therapy regimen (i.e., three hours per day minimum)  		intended for rehabilitation facility patients. Similarly, severely disabled  		individuals may be more easily cared for in SNFs than in community settings  		with home health services. On the other hand, availability of informal care  		increases the likelihood that post-acute care could be provided in the  		community, or in institutional settings where the goal is to return to the  		community, rather than in institutional settings explicitly designed to provide  		long-term care.</p>
<p><i><b>Age, gender, and race</b></i>. Older age increases the likelihood  		of post-acute care use, because it reflects both increased frailty, which  		requires more extended care after a hospital stay, and increased formal care  		needs as a consequence of a weakened informal care network. Persons at older  		ages are also more likely to use SNFs than younger persons, while younger  		persons are more likely to use home health care and rehabilitation facilities  		(Neu, Harrison, Heilbrunn, 1989; Steiner and Neu, 1993; Gage, 1998). Younger  		persons are also more likely to be able to tolerate the intensive therapy  		provided by rehabilitation facilities and to have access to the informal care  		necessary to receive post-acute care in community settings.</p>
<p>Women are more likely than men to use any post-acute care services, in  		part because they are less likely to have informal support from spouses  		(Steiner and Neu, 1993). Women also live longer than men and are more likely,  		in general, to be a provider of informal care for their spouses. Hence, after  		discharge from hospitals, women are more likely to need Medicare post-acute  		care services than men.</p>
<p>Whites have a greater propensity than blacks to use SNF services (Liu,  		Wissoker, and Rimes, 1998; Steiner and Neu, 1993; Gage, 1998). Although earlier  		studies found that blacks were more likely than whites to receive post-acute  		care services provided by home health and rehabilitation services, Gage (1998)  		found that race was not a significant predictor of rehabilitation service  		receipt in 1995 after controlling for other factors.</p>
<p><i><b>Availability of informal care</b></i>. Studies have also examined  		measures that more directly reflect availability of informal care, such as  		living arrangement and marital status. Findings are generally consistent with  		the notion that availability of informal care reduces use of Medicare paid  		services. At the same time, informal care tends to reduce the likelihood of  		institutional care relative to home health care (Kane, Finch, Chen, et al.,  		1994).</p>
<p><i><b>Dual eligibility</b></i>. Findings on the effect of Medicaid  		eligibility status on Medicare post-acute care use appears to be changing over  		time. In 1987-88, being eligible for Medicaid as well as Medicare slightly  		increased the use of SNFs, but slightly decreased the use of home health or  		rehabilitation services. By 1995, dually eligible persons were 7 percent more  		likely to use rehabilitation facilities and 53 percent more likely to use SNFs  		than other Medicare beneficiaries (Gage, 1998).</p>
<p><i><b>Health and functional status</b></i>. Not surprisingly, measures  		of illness severity are associated with increased likelihood of post-acute care  		use (Steiner and Neu, 1993). Longer prior hospital stays for persons with the  		same DRGs, or the presence of a secondary diagnosis, for example, increased the  		likelihood of use of rehabilitation services, SNFs or home health care  		providers.</p>
<p>Poor functional status measured in different ways has consistently been  		found to increase likelihood of post-acute care use. The explanatory power of  		functional status in predicting such care has been strong both for samples of  		all hospital discharges and for persons with the same prior hospital DRG (e.g.,  		stroke, congestive heart failure). Severe disability also has been found to  		increase the likelihood of SNF use relative to home health care use among  		persons who used either (Liu, Wissoker and Rimes, 1998).</p>
<p>Health factors are particularly important in predicting a Medicare  		beneficiary's propensity to use rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility, and  		home health services, either individually or in combination. One recent study  		analyzed the factors associated with using these services to determine the  		extent to which use is driven by medical need or influenced by other factors,  		like payment policies (Gage, 1998). After controlling for DRGs, age, prior  		disability, hospital readmissions, race, sex, Medicaid status, and geographic  		regions, the study showed that discharge destinations for most of the 10  		post-acute "transfer" DRGs did not change from what they were in a simple  		bivariate comparison. For example, in both the bivariate and multivariate  		analyses, pneumonia (DRG 89), congestive heart failure (DRG 127), chronic  		obstructive pulmonary disease (DRG 88), and patients with nutritional and  		metabolic disorders (DRG 296) are most likely to use only home health care.  		Joint patients (DRG 209) are most likely to use home health along with either  		rehabilitation or SNF services. They are also more likely to use home health  		(9.8 percentage points more) than SNFs.</p>
<p><b><i>Provider Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p>Characteristics of PPS hospitals have been studied to determine how they  		affect post-acute care use in general, as well as the relative use of SNFs,  		home health care and rehabilitation services.</p>
<p><i><b>Affiliation</b></i>. A recurring theme about hospital  		characteristics and post-acute care use is the increased likelihood of  		post-acute care use when acute-care hospitals from which patients are  		discharged have an organizational affiliation with post-acute care providers.  		For example, larger hospitals have been found to be more likely to discharge  		patients to rehabilitation services, plausibly because such hospitals are more  		likely to contain rehabilitation units (Steiner and Neu, 1993). Similar  		conclusions have been inferred for teaching hospitals. For-profit hospitals  		have been found more likely to discharge patients to home health care,  		plausibly because for-profit hospitals are more likely than not-for-profit  		hospitals to operate home health agencies. Finally, greater likelihood of  		post-acute care use of stroke and COPD patients has been observed for hospitals  		recorded as owning post-acute care providers (Blewett, Kane and Finch,  		1995).</p>
<p><i><b>Medicare volume and length of stay</b></i>. For specific DRGs  		(e.g., hip fracture), persons discharged from hospitals with relatively greater  		volume of Medicare patients are more likely to receive post-acute care  		(Blewett, Kane and Finch, 1995). A discharging hospital's average length of  		stay, however, is more generally and negatively associated with the likelihood  		of using post-acute care, whether SNF, home health care, or rehabilitation  		services. In this case, average length of stay in the acute care hospital may  		be a proxy for local practice patterns, with longer hospital stays mitigating  		the need for post-acute care.</p>
<p><b><i>Market Area Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p>Supply of post-acute care providers, urban versus rural location, and  		Medicaid long-term care policies have also been found to influence use of  		Medicare's post-acute care services.</p>
<p><i><b>Provider supply</b></i>. Although supply of all types of  		post-acute care providers has grown rapidly in recent years, the large numbers  		and geographic distribution of SNF and home health care mean that such services  		should be more accessible to more Medicare beneficiaries than rehabilitation  		facilities and long-term care hospitals. The latter two are relatively few in  		number and tend to be geographically concentrated, restricting use of services  		to many fewer beneficiaries, regardless of level or type of need.</p>
<p>Beyond the global picture of post-acute care provider supply, research  		has found some important relationships between the use of the different types  		of providers. Although greater supply of a particular type of post-acute care  		provider tends to increase utilization of that provider, it also tends to  		decrease utilization of other types. For example, higher proportions of  		Medicare enrollees used home health services in areas with fewer nursing home  		beds (both Medicare certified and other beds) (Kenney and Dubay, 1992, Cohen  		and Tumlinson, 1997). This finding suggests that, for some post-acute care  		patients, SNF and home health care services might be substitutable. Similarly,  		SNF and rehabilitation services have been found to act as substitutes for some  		of the most common DRGs resulting in post-acute care use (Steiner and Neu,  		1993). In contrast, rehabilitation bed supply was found to be positively  		associated with the rate of Medicare home health use, suggesting that  		rehabilitation and home health care may be used in sequence for some  		beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Sequential use of SNFs, home health care, and rehabilitation facilities  		is not uncommon. MedPAC (1998) found, for example, that 17.7 percent of first  		post-acute provider stays were followed by a second post-acute provider stay,  		and the vast majority of the multiple provider use involved more than one type  		of provider (e.g., rehabilitation facilities followed by home health). What is  		not clear is which patterns of service use applies to which groups of patients,  		and little is known about optimal patterns of multiple post-acute care provider  		use.</p>
<p><i><b>Urban and rural areas</b></i>. Use of post-acute care is more  		likely in urban than in rural areas, which is consistent with the greater  		availability of post-acute care providers in urban areas. Such an inference is  		supported by findings that, after controlling for supply of SNFs and home  		health agencies, urban versus rural location did not differentiate likelihood  		of use. It is also true, however, that people living in rural areas who use  		either type of provider are more likely to use SNF services (Liu, Wissoker, and  		Rimes, 1998).</p>
<p><i><b>State Medicaid policies</b></i>. Because SNFs and home health care  		providers also deliver long-term care services financed in large part by  		Medicaid, state Medicaid policies governing those services can be expected to  		affect Medicare spending. Studies of interactions between Medicaid and Medicare  		confirm this expectation, finding a generally inverse relationship between  		expenditures for the two programs (Kenney, Rajan, and Soscia, 1998). Medicare  		home health use is also higher in states that face greater fiscal pressure  		concerning their Medicaid budgets (Cohen and Tumlinson, 1997). Particularly in  		recent years, some states have implemented a Medicare maximization strategy,  		increasing pressure on nursing homes and home care organizations to increase  		their billing of Medicare for services that might otherwise have been paid by  		Medicaid. This pressure is exerted in various ways, ranging from educating  		providers about Medicare coverage rules to imposing penalties on providers that  		do not meet specified Medicare revenue growth targets.</p>
<h3>C. Outcomes Differences across Post-Acute Care  		Providers</h3>
<p>Central to any attempts to determine whether post-acute care is provided  		more efficiently by one type of provider relative to others is knowledge about  		which combination of services and settings result in optimal patient outcomes  		in recovery from illness, improvements in functional capacity, and other  		dimensions of wellness. We focus our review, in this section, on studies that  		have addressed the relative outcomes of patients served in post-acute care  		settings. Embedded in these studies are also some of the most detailed analyses  		of differences in intensity of services provided by different post-acute care  		providers.</p>
<p>As shown for post-stroke rehabilitation, practice patterns can vary  		substantially by geographic location in a way that cannot be explained by  		patient characteristics alone (Lee et al., 1997). To determine the extent to  		which post-acute care patients are receiving appropriate care in the most  		cost-effective manner, it is necessary to study outcome-based quality of care  		across multiple provider types. If similar outcomes were found for similar  		patients receiving care in different post-acute settings, it would be possible  		to infer, for example, that one modality was more efficient, or that a minimum  		level of (or spending for) post-acute care could produce the optimal outcomes  		for patients with specific needs.</p>
<p>Only a handful of studies have examined patient outcomes and costs in  		the post-acute care setting. At present, very little information exists on the  		balance between patient needs and the amount and types of services needed to  		achieve optimal outcomes. A study by Munin and colleagues (1998) found that  		individuals transferred to a rehabilitation hospital after three days  		experienced better initial outcomes than those beginning rehabilitation after  		seven days. However, the study does not allow conclusions about the relative  		efficacy of care in other post-acute settings.</p>
<p>Kramer and colleagues (1997) examined the effectiveness and cost of  		rehabilitation for patients with hip fracture or stroke admitted to  		rehabilitation facilities, subacute SNFs, and traditional SNFs. Rehabilitation  		facilities had better outcomes for stroke patients than SNFs, after adjusting  		for the fact that patients admitted to SNFs tended to be more functionally and  		cognitively impaired. SNF stroke patients had significantly more ADL  		difficulties than rehabilitation facility stroke patients at six months. And  		there were significant differences in Medicare costs between rehabilitation  		facility and SNF admissions, even after controlling for shorter lengths-of-stay  		in rehabilitation facilities. The authors concluded that for stroke patients  		the more comprehensive therapy services provided by rehabilitation facilities  		can lead to better outcomes, in terms of functional recovery and community  		placement. However, these additional services led to higher costs, which in the  		case of hip fracture patients did not appear to confer any additional benefit  		vis-á-vis hip fracture patients treated in traditional SNFs.</p>
<p>In another major study on post-acute care outcomes, Kane and colleagues  		(1997a) found that improved functional outcomes could be achieved with better  		decisions about where older patients should go upon discharge from acute-care  		hospitals. Stroke or hip fracture patients who were discharged to  		rehabilitation facilities or to home health care, for example, had better  		functional improvement than those discharged to nursing homes at various time  		points after hospital discharge (six weeks, six months, and one year).  		Rehabilitation facilities, relative to SNFs and home health care, also  		demonstrated the greatest potential for functional improvement for stroke  		patients who had high ADL dependency scores at discharge. Home health care  		resulted in greater ADL improvement for stroke patients who had low ADL  		dependency scores at discharge.</p>
<p>Using these empirical findings, Kane and colleagues (1997b) conducted  		simulations in which actual discharge placements were compared to those that  		would have produced "optimal" outcomes for the patients at various points in  		time after discharge. They found very little (23 percent to 50 percent)  		concordance between actual discharge location and location settings where  		patients could achieve the maximum functional improvement. The study results  		also suggested that discharging patients to their optimal discharge locations  		could achieve functional improvements at little or no additional costs to  		Medicare. The authors concluded that decision-making around hospital discharge  		planning could be improved if pressures to discharge patients quickly were  		reduced and better data on patient outcomes were available. They suggested,  		further, that bundling the payment for hospitals with that for post-acute care  		would be one way to encourage more effective post-acute care choices.</p>
<p>Researchers at Marionjoy found that most outcomes were not significantly  		different for patients treated in subacute SNF and hospital-based  		rehabilitation settings after controlling for age, sex, diagnosis, primary  		payer, and admission status (Kilgore et al., 1993; Oken et al., 1994). Although  		hospital patients achieved better outcomes on some measures of independence  		(e.g., bowel and bladder function, skin care, and medication management), the  		researchers concluded that subacute care was more cost-effective overall.  		Keith, Wilson, and Gutierrez (1995) reached similar conclusions related to  		functional outcomes for SNF and rehabilitation hospital patients. In another  		Marionjoy study, however, rehabilitation patients treated in the subacute SNF  		had significantly higher death rates and emergency rehospitalizations than  		patients treated in the rehabilitation hospital (Rao et al., 1994).</p>
<p>Recognizing the paucity of information on outcomes of post-acute care,  		ASPE sponsored an initiative to design a quality measurement study that would  		compare outcomes of patients with similar post-acute care needs across multiple  		provider types. This two-and-a-half-year project, which is being conducted by  		the University of Colorado with assistance from the Urban Institute, is in its  		first year.</p>
<h2><a name="secVI" id="secVI">VI. PPS AND MANAGED CARE RESEARCH AND  		DEVELOPMENT</a></h2>
<p>The BBA provisions are part of a continuing process to reform the  		Medicare post-acute care benefit. Responding to the BBA mandate, HCFA is in the  		process of developing prospective payment systems for most post-acute care  		services. This section discusses current efforts in that regard. It also  		discusses the limited information on post-acute care under managed care, an  		arena that could provide insight on how post-acute care services might be  		provided more efficiently under incentives to minimize resource use.</p>
<h3>A. Current Development of Prospective Payment  		Systems</h3>
<p>The difficulties inherent in establishing prospective payment systems  		will vary by provider type. Extensive completed research on establishing a per  		diem-based PPS for skilled nursing facilities enabled the development of a  		patient classification-based payment system that went into effect in July,  		1998. Considerable research has also been completed on PPS for rehabilitation  		facilities, based largely on episodes of care (Carter et al., 1997; Stineman,  		1995). Studies have been completed on per visit payment for home health care,  		and research is currently underway for episode-based payment alternatives. HCFA  		is beginning to examine casemix characteristics of long-term care hospital  		patients as an initial step toward developing a PPS for those providers.</p>
<p><i><b>SNFs</b></i>. The PPS system for SNFs is based on what is known as  		RUG-III, a 44-group classification system designed and tested for Medicare and  		Medicaid nursing home patients (Fries et al., 1994). It classifies patients  		into homogeneous groups according to health and functional characteristics and  		the amount and type of resources they use. Information used to classify  		patients into RUG-III groups is derived from the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Unlike  		hospital DRGs, which classify patients based on a per discharge basis, RUG-III  		was developed to classify patients on a per diem cost basis. The initial set of  		groupings of the RUG-III system is a hierarchy representing residents grouped  		according to their clinical characteristics (rehabilitation, extensive  		services, special care, clinically complex, impaired cognition, behavior  		problems, and reduced physical function). Within each set of clinical  		characteristics, patients are grouped into more refined categories representing  		resource-use requirements. The rehabilitation category is divided into five  		levels of service intensity, for example, based on the total minutes of therapy  		received per week, the days of therapy per week, and the number of different  		types of therapy received. Residents whose clinical conditions do not require  		therapy are classified into descending order of severity, based on number of  		services used and the amount of time and resources required for their care.  		Although the RUG III-based payment system is already in operation, HCFA is  		continuing research into further refinements of it, with a current focus on the  		cost of non-therapy ancillary services.</p>
<p><b><i>Home health care</i></b>. Casemix measurement systems for home  		health are less well developed than for SNF services. HCFA is currently  		sponsoring two projects. One is a demonstration testing episode-based,  		casemix-adjusted payments. The casemix system used in this project is based on  		16 cells that indicate, for example, whether a patient was recently  		hospitalized or has one of three chronic health care conditions. This casemix  		system is effective for distinguishing the health status of patients but not  		for predicting expected resource use. The second project aims to create a  		casemix measurement system based on the Outcome and Assessment Information Set  		(OASIS) developed by the University of Colorado for tracking the outcome-based  		quality measures of Medicare home health services. This project, being  		conducted by Abt Associates, has already added data items to the OASIS--the new  		instrument is called "OASIS-plus"--and is currently in the data collection  		phase.</p>
<p>Additional efforts, not sponsored by HCFA but growing out of extended  		research from the SNF measurement community, are using the MDS instrument as a  		basis to create MDS-HC (Minimum Data Set-Home Care). The MDS-HC instrument  		differs from OASIS in that it is designed to measure resource use rather than  		functional outcomes.</p>
<p><i><b>Rehabilitation facilities</b></i>. Research on a casemix-adjusted  		payment system for rehabilitation facilities has focused on episode-based  		payments using the Function Independence Measure-Functional Related Groups  		(FIM-FRG) system. The FIM-FRG system for rehabilitation hospitals first assigns  		patients to one of 20 rehabilitation impairment categories (such as stroke or  		traumatic brain dysfunction) for which the patient is receiving rehabilitation.  		Patients are then further subdivided into 53 patient classes, using the  		patients' performance on the FIM motor test, the FIM cognitive test, and age  		(Stineman, 1995; Carter et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Other research is in progress to design a PPS for rehabilitation  		hospitals that would be based on a per diem payment. Part of this research is  		being conducted by the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged, the prime  		contractor on a project to develop an assessment instrument. The study draws  		from prior research on the MDS for nursing home residents, with the current  		version of the data collection instrument, MDS-PAC (Minimum Data Set-Post-Acute  		Care), designed to accommodate the more intensive, short-term care needs of  		rehabilitation and long-term care hospital patients. In addition, HCFA has  		contracted with Muse Associates to develop a per diem PPS for rehabilitation  		facilities. At this time, HCFA anticipates that this classifiction system will  		be based on methodology that is similar to the one used to develop the SNF  		prospective payment system.</p>
<p><i><b>Integrated systems</b></i>. Although the BBA has mandated that the  		development of PPS for SNF, for home health care, and for rehabilitation  		hospitals be put on a fast track, future reform efforts for Medicare post-acute  		care services are likely to focus on the integration of payment systems for all  		post-acute care providers. An obvious problem in establishing an integrated  		post-acute PPS is that the research, like the payment systems, have been  		specific to each type of provider. Much work remains to be done to develop a  		casemix-based payment system that spans the various provider types.</p>
<p>HCFA is supporting a study by the University of Minnesota to design an  		integrated post-acute payment system demonstration. A major objective of that  		study is to develop payment and casemix systems based on a single assessment  		instrument modified to account for differences in patients' medical conditions,  		instead of provider type. An important aspect of the Minnesota study will be to  		determine possibilities for applying products from other studies such as MDS-  		PAC and OASIS to studying patients across different post-acute care settings.  		Other issues, such as determining which provider should manage the payment, are  		also being investigated.</p>
<h3>B. Post-Acute Care under Managed Care</h3>
<p>Medicare HMOs are required to provide all Medicare-covered services, but  		they are not limited to the same coverage rules. For example, HMOs can admit  		beneficiaries to a SNF without requiring them to spend three days in a hospital  		prior to SNF admission. Hence, by using more SNF services in place of  		hospitalizations, HMOs could possibly increase their efficiency without  		decreasing the quality of care provided.</p>
<p>Early studies of Medicare's managed care program showed that  		beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs did, indeed, have different utilization rates of  		post-acute care services from those of the fee-for-service comparison group  		(Brown et al., 1993). One study found that HMO enrollees tended to have shorter  		hospital stays, more admissions to SNFs (but shorter stays), and fewer home  		health visits per person. The mix of home health services also differed for the  		two groups, with HMO enrollees using fewer aide and nurse services than their  		fee-for-service counterparts. The study did not investigate the use of  		rehabilitation or long-term care hospitals, however. A more recent study found  		that HMO patients who experienced strokes were more likely to be discharged to  		SNFs and less likely to go to rehabilitation hospitals or units (Retchin et  		al., 1997). The study did not find differences in survival or acute care  		hospital readmission between the HMO and fee-for-service groups. And it did not  		follow either long-term functional status or institutionalization status.</p>
<p>A study focusing on home health use found lower home health service  		costs among HMO enrollees relative to fee-for-service beneficiaries, even after  		casemix adjustments were made to account for the better health status of HMO  		enrollees (Schlenker, Shaughnessy, and Hittle, 1995). However, this study also  		found that beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service plans showed greater  		improvement than their HMO counterparts in some activities of daily living  		(ADLs) and other measures, such as medications management. Another study found  		that Medicare HMO enrollees received significantly fewer home health services  		than their fee-for-service counterparts, although there was no difference in  		<i>total</i> expenditures between the two populations. This study found that  		Medicare HMO enrollees also had a significantly higher rate of multiple  		hospital admissions than fee-for-service participants (Experton et al.,  		1997).</p>
<p>A recent study compared hip fracture patients enrolled in HMOs with  		individuals served by integrated fee-for-service systems (Kramer, 1996). HMOs  		were less likely than fee-for-service systems to provide rehabilitation in  		rehabilitation hospitals, relying largely on SNFs that provided more  		comprehensive rehabilitation services than typical SNFs. After controlling for  		case mix differences, the rehabilitation strategies used by the two systems  		produced comparable functional status outcomes.</p>
<p>Managed care organizations for Medicare enrollees provide a natural  		experiment for studying how post-acute care is provided in an integrated  		payment system, although thus far only a few studies have compared post-acute  		care use between fee-for-service and managed care settings. Even fewer studies  		have compared outcomes in the two care settings. Such research efforts could be  		cost-effective, particularly if assessments of quality outcomes were  		incorporated into the study design.</p>
<h2><a name="secVII" id="secVII">VII. POLICY ISSUES FOR THE FUTURE</a></h2>
<p>The 1997 BBA provisions mandating prospective payment systems for  		Medicare's post-acute care providers were an important policy response to the  		recent, rapid increases in post-acute care expenditures. Such provisions are  		only part of a continuing process to reform Medicare's post-acute care  		services, however. Other important cost, quality, and access issues relevant to  		Medicare's post-acute care services were not addressed by the BBA provisions.  		We highlight such issues here and note gaps in our knowledge about them.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Are increasing expenditures evidence that Medicare's system of  		post-acute care services is broken?</b></i> Greater than expected increases in  		expenditures are almost always a catalyst for a policy response. The recent  		trends in SNF, home health care and other post-acute care expenditures prompted  		the BBA provisions aimed at curtailing this spending growth. It is reasonable  		to ask, however, whether the growth in spending was in fact justified by an  		increasing need for post-acute care, particularly in light of declining growth  		in inpatient hospital spending. It is also possible, of course, that the recent  		levels of post-acute care spending have been excessive relative to the needs of  		Medicare beneficiaries discharged from acute-care hospitals. There is evidence  		to suggest that some spending may have been inappropriate (e.g., recent GAO  		reports of fraud and abuse in the Medicare home health program), but it has yet  		to determine how much of the increase in spending reflected actual increases in  		need for post-acute care rather than inappropriate resource use.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the rate of growth in spending for Medicare SNF  		and home health care has actually been declining, suggesting that such services  		may be approaching the "appropriate" level of need for the beneficiary  		population. As with the general trend in spending, however, we have yet to  		determine if the declining growth rates reflect response to beneficiaries'  		needs or to other factors--which include recent federal actions directed at  		post-acute care providers (e.g., increased scrutiny of billing practices) and  		other efforts to limit aggregate federal spending.</p>
<p><i><b>2. What is the goal of Medicare's home health program?</b></i> One  		factor behind the recent growth in Medicare's home health spending was the  		increase in number of visits that beneficiaries received, raising questions  		about whether Medicare's home health services had been transformed into a  		long-term care benefit. The increased use certainly resulted, at least in part,  		from the 1989 changes in eligibility and coverage guidelines that enabled more  		individuals to qualify for Medicare home health care services and more services  		to be provided to eligible individuals. For example, as long as they are  		homebound and in need of skilled care (or supervision), chronically ill  		patients can receive Medicare coverage primarily for help in performing  		personal care activities. Such activities, performed by home health aides, are  		more typical of long-term care needs than acute medical needs. No one knows how  		many people are using the benefit in this way. More important, there is much  		debate about whether Medicare should continue to cover persons needing extended  		home care services in any case.</p>
<p>In the process of designing the prospective payment system for home  		health care, it is important to address the overall goals of Medicare's home  		health care benefit. An episode-based payment methodology usually contains  		incentives for providers to constrain the amount of care delivered. As the  		design details are being set, it is important to remember that the treatment of  		outlier cases (those with extraordinarily long episodes) will directly affect  		the extent to which Medicare continues to serve persons needing extended home  		care services.</p>
<p>Several factors highlight the importance of addressing the extended home  		care issue in the development of new Medicare home health payment policies.  		Because the high visit users of Medicare home health care are generally older  		and more disabled (Komisar and Feder, 1998), they are more likely to need  		considerable amounts of care. If Medicare home health coverage is constrained,  		their need for services might be met by other types of Medicare post-acute care  		providers, possibly at higher costs to Medicare. In addition, constraints on  		Medicare financing for home care will increase the pressure on Medicaid to  		provide more home care for dually- eligible beneficiaries. Although we have yet  		to see how states will respond to the increased Medicaid burden, it is likely  		that publicly supported home care services for dually-eligible beneficiaries  		will be reduced from current levels.</p>
<p><i><b>3. What will be the access, quality and cost consequences of the  		BBA provisions?</b></i> Designed to curb future spending increases for  		post-acute care providers, the BBA provisions could have adverse consequences  		for beneficiaries, as well as for some providers. Ultimately depending on the  		design details, the PPS could provide incentives for home care providers,  		rehabilitation facilities, and other post-acute providers to contain costs by  		selecting relatively light care patients or by giving fewer services.  		Implementation of the SNF PPS in July 1998, for example, has already raised  		concern about the extent to which SNFs will refuse to admit patients with high  		non-therapy ancillary costs (e.g., for intravenous medications), because those  		costs might not be adequately accounted for in the casemix adjustments of the  		new payment system. Until further adjustments are made, SNFs are faced with  		financial incentives not to serve patients with high non-therapy ancillary  		costs. The BBA required the Secretary to review the effects of the SNF  		prospective payment system on quality, particularly for those beneficiaries in  		need of medication therapy.</p>
<p>The BBA provisions also could increase the likelihood of patients having  		to use multiple providers because of the financial needs of providers rather  		than well-being of patients. This is because prospective payment systems tend  		to create incentives to reduce costs, with possible negative implications for  		quality of care. As happened after Medicare implemented acute-care hospital  		PPS, some patients may be discharged "quicker and sicker." Pro-rated payments  		and appropriate transfer policies for certain cases that use multiple providers  		could mitigate this danger.</p>
<p>To the extent that post-acute care services generally are constrained by  		the BBA provisions, the result could be longer prior acute-care hospital stays  		and increases in acute-care hospital readmissions. Such an eventuality could  		indicate access and quality of care problems, which could, in turn, result in  		higher overall Medicare spending.</p>
<p>The fact that the BBA-mandated PPS will be implemented in stages over  		time suggests the possibility of a dynamic environment, in which incentives  		created by each of the new payment systems will affect behavior, first of the  		targeted provider type and then of other types of providers as well. This makes  		it hard (and hazardous) to visualize the post-acute care system that will  		ultimately emerge in response to all these changes. Since the collective  		effects of the BBA provisions cannot be adequately assessed for some time, a  		synthesis of impact studies conducted <i>during</i> implementation will be  		needed to identify the impact of the various BBA provisions on access, quality,  		and costs.</p>
<p><i><b>4. Will the supply of post-acute care providers change, and how  		will these changes affect Medicare beneficiaries?</b></i> As noted, according  		to anecdotal reports, some home health agencies are closing in the wake of the  		interim payment system (IPS) mandated by the BBA. In July, the National  		Association for Home Care reported that over 750 agencies or branch offices had  		been forced to close, over half of them in Texas, Louisiana, California, and  		Florida. While it is unclear whether these provider closings have resulted in  		services being discontinued in the area, or whether agencies have maintained  		staffing levels but redistributed the staff to other branch offices, the  		closings could potentially shift patients from home health to other settings.  		As also noted, this anecdotal evidence has stimulated Congress to study various  		options to lighten the impact of the IPS. These suggestions of post-IPS change  		in the supply of home health agencies is one indication of the effects that the  		BBA provisions may have on the supply of post-acute care providers. Depending  		on the specific features of the PPS to be developed for rehabilitation  		facilities and long-term care hospitals, incentives may be created that will  		affect (increase or decrease) their supply also.</p>
<p>The stronger financial incentives in the new payment rules could also  		lead to increased certification of certain types of facilities relative to  		other types. Distinctions among different post-acute care settings are already  		blurring because of new technologies (e.g., home infusion therapy), enhanced  		service delivery capacity (e.g., subacute care SNFs), and changes in the  		financing and delivery system (e.g., managed care organizations). But we know  		very little about whether the different post-acute care provider types provide  		comparable quality of care for various types of patients.</p>
<p><i><b>5. What is the effect of eligibility and coverage policies on  		access, quality and costs?</b></i> The BBA post-acute care provisions were  		directed primarily at reforming payment systems for post-acute care.  		Eligibility and coverage policies were not extensively addressed. As discussed  		above, changes in such policies had a major effect on expenditure trends in the  		past decade. And existing eligibility and coverage rules continue to provide a  		basis for increasing utilization of post-acute care services. Like the  		reimbursement policies, these rules also vary by type of post-acute care  		provider, and do not appear to have been systematically coordinated. Because  		eligibility and coverage rules are potentially very powerful policy levers,  		they should receive further consideration, either to improve efficiency with  		which post-acute care services are delivered or to capture additional Medicare  		savings.</p>
<p><i><b>6. Is integration of services on the basis of a patient-centered  		payment system a solution for Medicare post-acute care problems?</b></i>  		Despite the major payment reforms mandated by the BBA, some observers continue  		to note that Medicare's post-acute care system remains fragmented, with payment  		and coverage policies that vary by type of provider. ProPAC (1997), for  		example, pointed out that "Medicare will have to make comprehensive structural  		changes to its benefit and payment policies" if it is to improve the  		coordination of services and contain costs in the long run.</p>
<p>One testing ground for better integrated services has been in the  		managed care arena. Medicare beneficiaries who belong to HMOs at least  		theoretically have their entire continuum of care managed. Research indicates  		that, although HMO enrollees had different patterns of post-acute services than  		fee-for-service beneficiaries, quality of care was not necessarily better and  		sometimes worse. It is important that more information is collected on how  		quality is affected by use of different service mixes, regardless of whether it  		is in a managed care or fee-for-service system.</p>
<p>A fee-for-service strategy considered by HCFA is development of an  		integrated payment system that is patient-centered (Winn, 1997). In this type  		of system, payments would be based on the type and intensity of services needed  		to achieve optimal outcomes, regardless of provider category. This system is  		conceptually appealing and may be a desirable goal for reforming payment of  		Medicare post-acute care services. The urgency with which this strategy is  		pursued depends, however, on several practical issues.</p>
<p>First, a major motivation behind the patient-centered strategy is the  		notion that Medicare beneficiaries with similar needs receive similar  		post-acute care services from different providers at different costs to  		Medicare. We do not know the extent of this overlap. To some extent, the degree  		of overlap is mitigated by Medicare rules defining each provider category. For  		example, unlike home health care, SNF services are covered for individuals who  		need continuous nursing or therapy services that can only be provided in an  		institutional setting. Such types of requirements tend to direct patients, even  		those with the same hospital DRG, to different post-acute care settings.  		Research also indicates that personal and health characteristics tend to  		differentiate use of one type of post-acute care provider relative to others,  		even for patients with the same DRG. Important for policy applications is  		whether differences between patients, by provider setting, are relatively small  		(and can be risk-adjusted) or whether they require that patients be classified  		into separate groups. To the extent that the patient populations are  		substantially different across post-acute care providers, the need for an  		integrated payment system becomes less urgent.</p>
<p>Second, there is a paucity of information on quality outcomes associated  		with use of post-acute care. If different provider types serve similar  		patients, we cannot infer that Medicare payments to one type, relative to  		others, are too high or too low until we can relate quality outcomes to  		appropriate amounts and types of services required. Only a few studies, as  		discussed above, have addressed this subject. The level of effort and time  		required to analyze jointly patient characteristics, amount and types of  		services, and outcome-based quality measures is substantial. Even the few prior  		studies on the subject focused only on selected hospital DRGs. Because of the  		inherent complexities in the task, as a practical matter, an integrated payment  		system that includes quality outcomes may be able to cover only a portion of  		the Medicare post-acute care population. The issues with and feasibility of  		integrating payment for the entire post-acute care population or a subset  		thereof require consideration.</p>
<p>Third, if normative payments for post-acute care can be developed for  		specific groups of patients, decisions still have to be made about how the  		post-acute care payment will be administered. One option that has been  		discussed is to bundle post-acute care payment together with Medicare  		acute-care hospital payments. This option gives hospitals primary authority and  		responsibility for managing episodes of care. Such bundling conceptually  		provides hospitals the opportunity to manage efficiently the total episode of  		care, but it also gives them incentives (as in more general managed care  		models) to use affiliated providers and to minimize costs. Hence, questions can  		appropriately be raised about patients' access to alternative post-acute care  		providers and quality of patient care under this option. Other, less discussed  		options include making post-acute care episode payments to particular types of  		providers--such as integrated networks of providers, or independent case  		management organizations. Regardless of the eventual choices made, this issue  		is bound to be controversial and politically sensitive, because of the  		potential impact of any particular choice on the multiplicity of post-acute  		care providers.</p>

<p><b><i>Skilled Nursing Facilities</i></b></p>
<p>SNFs provide post-acute services to Medicare beneficiaries within 30  		days of a prior hospital stay and who require a lower level of inpatient care  		upon discharge (SNFs can also provide therapy services on an outpatient basis  		under Medicare Part B). SNFs can be hospital-based facilities, freestanding  		entities, or rural swing-bed hospitals (which use beds as either acute or  		skilled nursing care). SNFs bill Medicare Part A for therapy services that they  		provide directly. These therapy services, in addition to other ancillary  		services provided during a Part A covered stay, may also be provided by outside  		providers--such as rehabilitation agencies and independent therapists--under  		agreement. These providers are paid under Medicare Part B, but SNFs are  		required to bill for the services as a requirement of the consolidated billing  		provision.</p>
<p><b>Benefit</b>. The SNF benefit is primarily a Part A benefit that  		covers routine services (room, board, skilled nursing care), physical, speech,  		and occupational therapy, medical social services, pharmaceutical, laboratory  		services, supplies, and equipment. Individuals must require skilled nursing or  		rehabilitation services on a daily basis in an inpatient setting. The SNF stay  		must commence within 30 days of a prior hospital stay (that lasted for a  		minimum of three days). Medicare pays for up to 100 days of SNF care for each  		spell of illness. The SNF stay must be certified by a physician within 14 days  		of admission and at least every 30 days thereafter. After 100 days, Medicare  		will continue to pay for some ancillary services under Medicare Part B.</p>
<p><b>Certification</b>.</p>
<ul><li>Transfer agreement with a hospital to accept patients recommended for  		  SNF care</li>
<li>sufficient staffing to provide 24 nursing care by licensed nurses and  		  other nursing staff</li>
<li>have at least one registered nurse for at least 8 hours every  		  day</li>
<li>have a physician who supervises patient care and is available 24  		  hours a day to provide emergency services</li>
<li>have dietary, pharmaceutical, dental, and medical social  		  services</li>
</ul><p><b>Cost Sharing</b>. There is no deductible for Medicare SNF care. Daily  		coinsurance ($95.50 in 1998) is required for days 20-100. If ancillary services  		are paid under Part B, then the beneficiary is subject to Part B deductible and  		coinsurance.</p>
<p><b><i>Home Health Agencies</i></b></p>
<p>HHAs serve individuals who require skilled nursing care or therapy at  		home. Some agencies are freestanding while some are affiliated with other  		providers such as hospitals, SNFs, or rehabilitation facilities. HHAs employ  		registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, home health aides, therapists,  		social workers, and personal care attendants.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>. Medicare covers intermittent or part time skilled  		nursing care and physical, speech, or occupational therapy to Medicare  		beneficiaries confined to their homes. There is no prior hospitalization  		requirement or limit on the number of visits, although the individual must be  		under the care of a physician who reviews the plan of treatment at least every  		62 days. Under the 1997 BBA, home health visits not related to a prior hospital  		stay or any home health visits in excess of 100/spell of illness will be funded  		through Medicare Part B--effectively relieving Part A from home health  		expenditures which are not directly "post acute."</p>
<p><b>Certification</b>. Home health agencies must have capacity to provide  		part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care and at least one other  		therapeutic service (e.g. physical therapy or home health aide services) on a  		visiting basis (agency can contract for other rehabilitation services).  		Agencies must have a physician or registered nurse who supervises all care.</p>
<p><b>Cost sharing</b>. There is no copayment or deductible for home health  		visit, but individual is responsible for 20 percent copayment for durable  		medical equipment and some prescription drugs.</p>
<p><b><i>Rehabilitation Hospitals and Distinct Part Units</i></b></p>
<p>These facilities specialize in intensive inpatient rehabilitation and  		offer medical, rehabilitative nursing, physical, occupational, or speech  		therapy, social and psychological services, and orthotic and prosthetic  		services. Rehabilitation hospitals may also have outpatient departments.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>. Medicare Part A covers inpatient services at  		rehabilitation hospitals. Benefits include bed and board, medical and nursing  		services, lab tests, X-rays, pharmaceuticals, supplies, and other diagnostic or  		therapeutic services. Coverage last up to 90 days per spell of  		illness--beginning with the first day of hospitalization (including acute  		hospital stays prior to admission to a rehabilitation facility) and ending 60  		days after beneficiary is discharged and receives no other inpatient hospital  		or SNF services. The setting must be "reasonable and necessary" for the  		patient--meaning that the individual must require frequent physician  		involvement, 24-hour rehabilitation nursing, generally at least 3 hours of  		therapy per day, and a coordinated team of therapists. Individuals must also be  		expected to improve as a result of therapy.</p>
<p><b>Certification</b>. Rehabilitation facilities must demonstrate that 75  		percent of their inpatients in the previous reporting year received intensive  		rehabilitation services for at least one of ten specific medical conditions.  		Each facility must also have a physician who acts as the full time director of  		rehabilitation. Most other requirements are met through the facility also being  		certified as a hospital through the Joint Commission on Accreditation of  		Healthcare Organizations and the Commission for Accreditation of Rehabilitation  		Facilities. Distinct-part units need to meet the same requirements and be part  		of a hospital that is paid under PPS, while remaining distinct administratively  		(e.g. admission and discharge).</p>
<p><b>Cost sharing</b>. Same as PPS inpatient hospital cost sharing.  		Deductible is $764 for each spell of illness with daily coinsurance of $191 for  		days 61-90.</p>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Care Hospitals</i></b></p>
<p>Hospitals in which the average patient stay is over 25 days. Can offer  		specialized services (e.g. physical rehabilitation, or ventilator dependent  		care) or can provide more generalized services (e.g. cancer treatment, chronic  		disease care). Can be associated with another facility (a "hospital within a  		hospital").</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b>. Inpatient stays at long-term care hospitals covered  		under Medicare Part A include bed and board, medical and nursing services, lab  		tests, X-rays, pharmaceuticals, supplies, and other diagnostic or therapeutic  		services--covered up to 90 days in "spell of illness."</p>
<p><b>Certification</b>. Long-term care hospitals must have provider  		agreement with Medicare. Intermediaries verify that facility meets the  		requirement that average stay is at least 25 days. Long-term care "hospitals  		within hospitals" must demonstrate independence from parent organizations on  		several levels in order to be paid under TEFRA and not PPS--as other long- term  		care hospitals and rehabilitation facilities are.</p>
<p><b>Cost Sharing</b>. Same as PPS inpatient hospital cost sharing.  		Deductible is $764 for each spell of illness with daily coinsurance of $191 for  		days 61-90.</p>
<h2><a name="appendB" id="appendB">APPENDIX B: DETERMINANTS OF POST-ACUTE CARE  		USE</a></h2>
<p>This appendix reviews findings from research on the determinants of  		post-acute care use, including patient characteristics, provider  		characteristics, market area factors, and state Medicaid policies on long-term  		care services. It emphasizes factors that differentiate the use of one provider  		modality relative to others.</p>
<p>Most prior research has focused on persons discharged from hospitals  		with particular DRGs (e.g., representing stroke or hip fractures), but some  		studies have analyzed post-acute care use of all persons discharged from  		hospitals, regardless of their hospital DRG. For example, the Prospective  		Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) identified the DRGs with the greatest  		volume or the highest proportion of hospital discharges to rehabilitation or  		long-term care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies  		in 1994. Discharge destinations for these DRGS were studied, as well as prior  		hospital length of stay, duration of post-acute services, variations in  		beneficiary characteristics, and the significance of whether a provider was a  		hospital-based facility. In contrast, recent studies by Liu, Wissoker and Rimes  		(1998) and Gage (1998) have examined destinations of all hospital discharges to  		identify factors predicting the use of post-acute care providers.</p>
<h3>A. Personal and Health Characteristics</h3>
<p><b>Age</b>. Increasing age has widely been found to be associated with  		higher use of post-acute care, reflecting both an increased frailty that  		requires more extended care after a hospital stay and need for more formal care  		as a possible consequence of a weakened informal care network. Age was a  		significant predictor of increased use of post-acute care in studies of all  		hospital discharges (Gage, 1998; Liu, Wissoker and Rimes, 1998) and discharges  		for specific DRGs that are commonly followed by post-acute care service use  		(Neu, Harrison, Heilbrunn, 1989; Steiner and Neu, 1993).</p>
<p>Increasing age also differentiates use of the different types of  		post-acute care providers. The RAND studies, for example, found that older  		hospital patients were more likely than younger ones to use SNF care (Neu,  		Harrison, Heilbrunn, 1989; Steiner and Neu, 1993). The very oldest patients (85  		or older) were less likely than younger ones to use HHA and rehabilitation  		services. Gage (1998) found similar differences in SNF and rehabilitation  		hospitals but did not find significant differences in the use of home health  		care providers in 1995, after controlling for medical conditions, Medicaid  		eligibility, and use of other services. Coverage rules for rehabilitation care  		requiring certification for improvement or recovery of patients may reduce the  		likelihood that the oldest (frailest) beneficiaries will use this provider  		modality. The oldest patients may be less likely to use HHA services because  		they are most likely not to have the informal care resources that are often  		required to remain in the community.</p>
<p><b>Gender</b>. Neu, Harrison and Heilbrunn (1989) found that, in  		1984-85, being female was associated with increased likelihood of using SNF,  		HHA, and rehabilitation hospital services. In 1987-88, the one exception to the  		generally greater use of post-acute care services by women was the finding that  		women discharged from hospitals with stroke DRGs were less likely to use  		rehabilitation services than men (Steiner and Neu, 1993). Because older women,  		relative to older men, are less likely to have a spousal caregiver, the effect  		of gender on post-acute care use may be a proxy for the effect of informal  		caregiver availability. Liu, Wissoker and Rimes (1998) found that being female  		was not a significant predictor of use of either SNF or HHA care when marital  		status, functional disability and other factors were taken into account.</p>
<p><b>Race</b>. Blacks are more likely than whites to use post-acute care  		services provided by home health care providers and rehabilitation facilities  		(Steiner and Neu, 1993). In contrast, whites have a higher propensity to use  		SNF services. Consistent with those results, Liu, Wissoker and Rimes (1998)  		found that non-whites were less likely than whites to use SNF care relative to  		HHA care. Controlling for medical conditions, age, and Medicaid eligibility,  		Gage (1998) found that race was not a significant predictor of rehabilitation  		services or home health care, but found that whites used significantly more SNF  		services than others in 1995. Beyond the empirical findings, it is still  		unclear whether the differences by race in types of providers used "denote the  		preferences of patients, providers, or discharge planners, supply constraints,  		or some combination of these" (Steiner and Neu, 1993).</p>
<p><b>Medicaid eligibility</b>. Small differences have been found in the  		use of post-acute care services by Medicaid and non-Medicaid elderly persons.  		Medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to Medicaid might be expected to  		have higher post-acute care costs than other beneficiaries because their  		overall Medicare costs are higher. It has been estimated that, whereas dually  		Medicare and Medicaid eligible individuals comprise about 16 percent of the  		total Medicare population, their expenditures are approximately 30 percent of  		total Medicare payments (HCFA, 1997). A major reason for the higher costs of  		the dually eligible is that they have more complex medical needs and are also  		more functionally disabled than other beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In their analysis of post-acute care use in 1987-88, Steiner and Neu  		(1993) did not find major differences between the propensity for Medicaid and  		non-Medicaid elderly persons to use some form of post-acute care services when  		all hospital discharges were considered. They did find that Medicaid  		beneficiaries, in contrast to non-Medicaid beneficiaries, were slightly more  		likely to use SNF and slightly less likely to use HHA care or rehabilitation  		hospital services. Examining post-acute care use in 1992-93, Liu, Wissoker, and  		Rimes (1998) found that, after controlling for health status, functional  		status, and other characteristics, being eligible for Medicaid increased  		slightly the likelihood of using either SNF or HHA care. By 1995,  		dually-eligible individuals were 7 percent more likely to use rehabilitation  		services and 53 percent more likely to use SNFs than beneficiaries who were not  		Medicaid eligible (Gage, 1998). These findings indicate that the effect of  		Medicaid eligibility on post-acute care use has been changing over time.</p>
<p><b>Functional status</b>. Poor functional status, measured in terms of  		dependencies in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities  		of daily living (IADLs), increases the likelihood of using post-acute care  		service use. Analyses addressing all hospital discharges and selected DRGs  		found that functional dependency increased likelihood of post-acute use of  		SNFs, home health care providers and rehabilitation services. For all hospital  		discharges in 1992-93, Liu, Wissoker, and Rimes (1998) found that people with  		ADL or IADL dependencies were more likely to use post-acute care than people  		who were not dependent. They also found that among people who used either SNF  		or HHA services, those who were dependent in three or more ADLs were more  		likely to use SNF rather than HHA services. These findings are consistent with  		those of Kramer, Shaughnessy and Pettigrew (1985), who found that greater  		percentages of Medicare SNF patients were dependent in ADLs than home health  		patients.</p>
<p>In their analysis of post-acute care for selected DRGs, Kane and  		colleagues (1996) found that ADL and IADL scores were positively associated  		with post-acute care for stroke, congestive heart failure patients as well as  		those with hip procedures. The investigators also found that patients who went  		home, rather than to institutional care, had lower disability on discharge from  		the hospitals (Kane, 1994). In general, the Kane studies found that poor  		functional status measured in various ways (e.g., self-reported dependencies,  		physical demonstration of ADLs prior to discharge) was a significant predictor  		of post-acute care use (Blewett, Kane and Finch, 1995).</p>
<p><b>Living arrangement, informal support, marital status</b>. The  		availability of "able and willing" informal caregivers tends to reduce the  		likelihood of post-acute care use, and favor home care instead of institutional  		care among users. The potential availability of informal caregivers is  		reflected by numerous variables including living arrangement, marital status,  		and informal support. Patients discharged from hospitals are more likely to use  		formal home health care if they have "less accessible social support" (Solomon  		et al., 1993). Among stroke patients, Kane et al. (1994) found that those going  		home were less likely to live alone than those going to institutions. Liu,  		Wissoker, and Rimes (1998) found that elderly persons discharged from hospitals  		were less likely to use post-acute SNF or HHA services if they were married,  		suggesting that informal care from spouses substituted for formal post-acute  		care. They also found that being married decreased the likelihood of using SNFs  		relative to home health care providers among persons who used one or the other  		service.</p>
<p><b>Health factors</b>. Health factors are particularly important in  		predicting a Medicare beneficiary's propensity to use rehabilitation, skilled  		nursing facility, and home health services, either individually or in  		combination. One recent study analyzed the factors associated with using these  		services to determine the extent to which use is driven by medical need or  		influenced by other factors, like payment policies (Gage, 1998). After  		controlling for DRGs, age, prior disability, hospital readmissions, race, sex,  		Medicaid status, and geographic regions, the study showed that discharge  		destinations for most of the 10 post-acute "transfer" DRGs did not change from  		what they were in a simple bivariate comparison. For example, in both the  		bivariate and multivariate analyses, pneumonia (DRG 89), CHF (DRG 127), COPD  		(DRG 88), and patients with nutritional and metabolic disorders (DRG 296) are  		most likely to use home health only. Joint patients (DRG 209) are most likely  		to use home health with either rehabilitation or SNF services, but they are  		also more likely to use home health (9.8 percentage points more) than SNF, all  		else equal.</p>
<p>Patient characteristics and medical need were related to changes in the  		post-acute providers used by other high post-acute DRGs, including stroke (DRG  		14), hip (DRG 210), and respiratory patients (DRG 79) suggesting that medical  		conditions play a significant role in predicting discharge destination for  		these cases. Stroke patients (who were most likely to use multiple services)  		were next most likely to use home health services instead of a SNF after  		controlling for individual characteristics. The change in the relative  		probability of using each service between a bivariate and multivariate  		comparison suggests that patient acuity plays a significant role in directing  		stroke patients into one setting over another which would moderate the effects  		of other factors, such as new payment incentives.</p>
<p><b>Severity of illness</b>. The RAND studies found that severity of  		illness, measured in several different ways, increased the likelihood of  		post-acute care use. In 1984-85 and 1987-88, Neu and colleagues found that  		longer hospital length of stay, within DRG categories, was associated with  		greater propensity to use post-acute care. They also found that persons with a  		secondary diagnosis were more likely to use post-acute care (Steiner and Neu,  		1993). Longer hospital length of stay was also significant in predicting  		rehabilitation hospital, SNF or HHA care in 1995, even after controlling for  		medical conditions preceding post-acute care use (Gage, 1998).</p>
<h3>B. Provider Characteristics</h3>
<p><b>Hospital size and teaching status</b>. Hospital size and teaching  		status are not generally associated with patterns of post-acute care use.  		Steiner and Neu ( 1993) found that size of hospitals had no effect on SNF or  		HHA use. Larger hospitals were more likely to discharge patients to  		rehabilitation services, possibly because such hospitals contained  		rehabilitation units. Teaching hospitals were also more likely to discharge  		patients to rehabilitation, a finding that would be consistent with the  		likelihood that teaching hospitals are tertiary hospitals with rehabilitation  		units. Blewett, Kane, and Finch (1995) found that effects of teaching hospital  		status on post- acute care use varied by DRG of the discharges.</p>
<p><b>Ownership</b>. Researchers have also examined the impact of ownership  		on use of post-acute care. Steiner and Neu (1993) found that proprietary  		hospitals were more likely than nonprofit ones to discharge patients to home  		health care providers, possibly because proprietary hospitals also operate home  		health agencies to a greater extent than non-profit hospitals. ProPAC (1996)  		found that home health beneficiaries who used proprietary agencies had longer  		episodes and more visits per episode. This mirrored Kenney and Dubay's (1992)  		finding that metropolitan statistical areas with proportionally more  		proprietary home health agencies had higher numbers of visits per user. A study  		that included directly hospital ownership of one or more post-acute care  		providers as an explanatory variable found that hospital ownership considerably  		increased (3 to 5 times) the likelihood of use of post-acute care for stroke  		and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (Blewett, Kane, and  		Finch, 1995). Interestingly, that study did not find a significant relationship  		between hospital ownership and post-acute care use for congestive heart  		failure, hip procedure and hip fracture patients.</p>
<p><b>Hospital-based, post-acute care providers</b>. Several studies have  		documented differences between hospital-based and freestanding facilities. In  		an analysis of discharges to post-acute care for selected DRGs, Blewett, Kane,  		and Finch (1995) found that for stroke and COPD cases, patients discharged from  		hospitals that owned a post-acute care facility were more likely to use  		post-acute care than patients discharged from other hospitals. ProPAC (1996)  		found that post-acute care use was about 10 percent more likely when the  		hospital owned a post-acute care provider, and that among beneficiaries who  		used post-acute care, acute inpatient length-of-stay was shorter in hospitals  		that owned a post-acute care provider.</p>
<p>ProPAC also found that length-of-stay in hospital-based SNFs (16.7 days)  		was only half that of freestanding SNFs (33.6 days) and that patients in  		hospital-based SNFs were less likely to be 85 years or older (26 percent)  		compared to patients in freestanding SNFs (37 percent). Patients discharged  		from hospital-based SNFs were also more likely to receive additional post-acute  		care services than patients discharged from freestanding facilities, 24 percent  		(versus 13 percent in freestanding facilities) received home health benefits,  		and 9 percent (versus 4 percent) received care in another SNF.</p>
<p><b>Disproportionate share hospitals (DSH)</b>. Steiner and Neu (1993)  		found that stroke and hip fracture patients discharged from hospitals that  		serve a "disproportionate share" of low-income patients had lower probabilities  		of receiving SNF care than patients discharged from other hospitals, while  		stroke patients were more likely to use HHA care if they were discharged from  		disproportionate share hospitals. A stronger finding by the same researchers  		was that patients in DSH hospitals were generally more likely to receive  		post-acute rehabilitation care than other hospital patients.</p>
<p><b>Medicare volume and length of stay</b>. Among hip fracture patients,  		hospitals with relatively greater volume of Medicare patients were more likely  		to be discharged to post-acute care than patients from hospitals with fewer  		Medicare patients, but this relationship was not found for other DRGs (Blewett,  		Kane, and Finch, 1995). Steiner and Neu (1993) found that the discharging  		hospital's average length of stay is inversely related to propensity for  		post-acute care use, despite the positive association between an individual's  		length of stay and likelihood of post-acute care use. Hospitals' average length  		of stay was negatively associated with post-acute care use for many of the DRGs  		studied and for all three modalities of post-acute care providers. They  		conclude that hospital average length of stay "appears to be a proxy for local  		practice patterns, whereby longer stays mitigate the need for post-acute  		services."</p>
<h3>C. Market Area Characteristics</h3>
<p><b>Supply of providers</b>. The supply of different types of post-acute  		care providers can have an important influence on the overall use of post-acute  		care. For example, Kenney and Dubay (1992) found that higher proportions of  		Medicare enrollees used home health services in areas with fewer nursing homes  		beds and with more home health agencies. Cohen and Tumlinson (1997) examined  		state variations in the use of the Medicare home health benefit and found that,  		among other factors, an increase of one skilled nursing facility per 1,000  		people older than age 65 resulted in a decrease of between 34 and 52 home  		health users per 1,000 Medicare enrollees between 1991 and 1993. Similarly, in  		an analysis of home health utilization between 1978 and 1984, Swan and Benjamin  		(1990) found that the number of nursing home beds per 1,000 elderly persons was  		negatively related to the number of Medicare home health visits per 100,000  		elderly persons.</p>
<p>RAND analysts found that, in 1987-88, supply of SNF beds in an area had  		only a weak effect, increasing likelihood of SNF use only in the case of  		certain DRGs (Steiner and Neu, 1993). On the other hand, they found that the  		extent to which SNF beds were hospital-based had a strong effect on the  		likelihood of increasing SNF use for all five of the DRGs they studied. SNF bed  		supply was not found to be associated with home health care use in four of the  		5 DRGs, but SNF and rehabilitation care were found to act as practical  		substitutes for each other with a negative relationship between the use of one  		type of care and the other. Interestingly, this study found a negative  		relationship between the number of Medicare-certified SNF beds and the rate of  		home health use in only one of the five selected DRG groupings.</p>
<p>RAND also found a positive association between rehabilitation bed supply  		and the probability of home health care use in four of the 5 DRGs, suggesting  		that rehabilitation and home health care may be used in sequence for some  		recovering beneficiaries. In their analysis of all hospital-discharges in  		1992-93, Liu, Wissoker and Rimes (1998) found that, for users of either SNF or  		HHA services, rehabilitation bed supply increased the likelihood of SNF use  		relative to HHA use. They hypothesized that availability of rehabilitation beds  		indicate geographic areas where institutional-level (both SNFs and  		rehabilitation hospitals) post-acute care is more common.</p>
<p><b>Urban and rural areas</b>. Use of post-acute care is more likely in  		urban, relative to rural, areas. Neu, Harrison and Heilbrunn (1989) speculate  		that this outcome may reflect the greater availability of each type of provider  		in urban areas. Liu, Wissoker and Rimes (1998) did not find differences between  		urban and rural areas in the likelihood of SNF or HHA use, when supply of SNF  		beds, rehabilitation beds and HHA nurses were controlled in a multivariate  		analysis. They did find, however, that among users of post-acute SNF or HHA  		care, living in a rural area had a positive association with SNF, relative to  		HHA, service use.</p>
<h3>D. State Medicaid Policies</h3>
<p>State Medicaid policies have been found to have an effect on the use of  		Medicare post-acute care services. Cohen and Tumlinson (1997) and Kenney, Rajan  		and Soscia (1998), for example, found an inverse relationship between Medicare  		and Medicaid home care expenditures, attributing some of those differences to  		state policies. Cohen and Tumlinson found that utilization of Medicare home  		health care is higher in states that face greater fiscal pressure concerning  		their Medicaid budgets and in states that lack personal care programs. They  		concluded that the overlap of the population served and the services provided  		by state Medicaid programs and Medicare has given states and providers an  		opportunity to leverage Federal funds. Similarly, Kenney, Rajan and Soscia  		(1998) found that Medicare home health use was a direct function of Medicaid  		use in many states, and identified state policies and activities, such as  		invoking penalties when providers are not "Medicare maximizing," that are  		strongly related to geographic variations in Medicare home health care use.</p>
