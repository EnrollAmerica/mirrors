<h3> INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) contracted  		with the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (UCHSC) to examine and  		describe models of physician practices in nursing homes; the financing  		arrangements and payment rates associated with these models; and determine what  		is known about the impact of physician practice models on the quality of care  		received by nursing home patients and on the quality of care provided in  		nursing homes.</p>
<p>In the first phase of this project, the UCHSC completed a literature  		review related to physician practice patterns in nursing homes, including the:  		requirements related to such practices; extent to which medical schools prepare  		physicians to practice in nursing homes; level of physician practice and  		specialization in providing services in nursing homes; barriers to physicians  		practicing in nursing homes and innovative physician practice arrangements in  		nursing homes.</p>
<p>The second phase of the study, which is presented in this report, was  		designed to further explore several issues that were not adequately addressed  		in the literature. Using information learned during the first phase,  		discussions were held in nursing homes and with key stakeholders in certain  		areas of the country to better understand the use and impact of various  		physician practice arrangements in nursing homes. This report summarizes  		discussions with stakeholders throughout the country in an attempt to identify  		obstacles and promising approaches to successful physician practices in nursing  		homes; synthesizes themes that recurred during the discussions; presents issues  		for further consideration; and offers potential areas for future research on  		physician practice in nursing homes.</p>
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>A purposeful sample of eight facilities was selected for case studies of  		physician practice models. The objective of the purposeful sampling methodology  		was to select varied examples of physician practice models in a range of  		markets and facilities. No attempt was made to select a representative sample  		from which to draw statistical inferences.</p>
<p><b>Market, Facility and Practice Models of Interest</b></p>
<p>The literature review identified multiple market, facility and practice  		model characteristics related to access to and quality of nursing home  		physician care. Market characteristics included: (1) managed care penetration,  		(2) rural location, (3) geographic region, and (4) litigious environment.  		Facility characteristics included: (1) ownership and (2) size. Practice model  		characteristics included various types of physician specialization in nursing  		home care including practices that: (1) emphasize geriatrics and teaching, (2)  		limit physician practice to only nursing home patients, (3) integrate mid-level  		providers, (4) limiting the number of physicians in the care of patients in one  		facility (including the use of closed panel physician groups), and (5) include  		a variety of other physician practice models.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholders of Interest</b></p>
<p>Stakeholders targeted for discussions in each nursing home included: (1)  		a physician, (2) the nursing home administrator, (3) the medical director, (4)  		the director of nursing, (5) a social worker, and (6) one stakeholder for each  		facility who was identified by other respondents as an employee who would add  		valuable information to the discussions because of their unique perspective on  		physician care in the facility. Once a facility agreed to participate, a  		representative from each of the vocational disciplines was contacted by e-mail,  		telephone or fax to arrange individual stakeholder discussions.</p>
<p><b>Creation and Administration of the Discussion Guides</b></p>
<p>Discussion guides (<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>) were created to  		assist interviewers gather information from stakeholders regarding physician  		practices in the selected nursing homes. The discussion guides focused on four  		areas: (1) qualifications and training of the practicing physicians and medical  		directors; (2) practice models and patterns used by physicians; (3) access to  		care associated with specific practice models; and (4) the quality of care  		provided in the practice models used in the facility. Six versions, one for  		each vocational discipline, of the discussion guides were created so that each  		respondent was asked a set of questions relevant to their vocational  		discipline.</p>
<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<p>Three themes emerged from the stakeholder discussions regarding  		physician practice in nursing homes including: (1) physician specialization in  		nursing home care; (2) benefits of mid-level practitioners; and (3) importance  		of information transfer.</p>
<p><b>Physician Specialization in Nursing Home Care</b></p>
<p>The form of physician specialization in nursing homes varied, but most  		stakeholders clearly valued models of care that permitted physicians to  		specialize in the care of nursing home residents. While the stakeholders did  		not have precise definitions for nursing home specialists, they generally  		defined physician specialists as those who spend a substantial portion of time  		in the delivery of nursing home care or have the majority of their patient care  		caseload in nursing homes.</p>
<p>The incentives to the physicians who specialize in nursing home care  		were described as: (1) a reduction in overhead expenses associated with  		maintaining an office practice among those who practiced exclusively in nursing  		homes; (2) an ability to develop improved knowledge of regulations in nursing  		homes and effectively meet the needs of the nursing homes; (3) scheduling  		flexibility; and (4) the opportunity for long-term relationships with patients  		and families. Stakeholders felt that if medical students had a greater exposure  		to nursing home care during medical training, more physicians would select this  		career path. Based on the literature review, early exposure to the benefits of  		specializing in nursing home care can increase the number of physicians  		specializing in nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Benefits cited by stakeholders regarding specialist nursing home  		physicians included: (1) greater accessibility of physicians to patients,  		family, and nursing home staff; (2) improved knowledge of and sensitivity by  		physicians to challenges faced by nursing homes (e.g., regulations regarding  		use of anti-psychotics); and (3) enhanced medical management of common  		syndromes faced by nursing home residents (e.g., falls, urinary incontinence,  		agitated behaviors associated with dementia). The literature review also  		suggested that selected outcomes are better among patients of physicians  		specializing in geriatric medicine.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nursing home regulatory requirements are unique and unlike the  		requirements in other health care arenas. The respondents associated lack of  		knowledge about these regulations with negative effects on physician  		communication with the nursing staff, medication ordering practices and  		compliance with regulatory visits. Several respondents found the American  		Medical Directors Association (AMDA) certification program a valuable resource  		in the pursuit of information on various regulatory requirements such as the  		use of physical and chemical restraints and required intervals for physician  		visitations. Sources identified in the literature review supported early  		exposure during training as a strategy to increase physician experience and  		familiarity with nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note2">2</a>,  		<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note3">3</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The stakeholders concept of the best model of specialization  		differed; some stakeholders favored a mid-level provider-based model (e.g.,  		using nurse practitioners (NPs) as is the practice in the Evercare model),  		others favored a closed physician practice model and still others preferred a  		model with physicians practicing independently in multiple facilities. The  		closed models provided a salary to the physicians in contrast to other models  		in which physicians obtained payments via billing Medicare Part B for physician  		services rendered to individual patients. In the literature review, selected  		outcomes (e.g., response to emergencies, hospitalization rates, satisfaction)  		were superior in mid-level provider and closed models compared to the  		traditional independent physician practice model.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note5">5</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note6">6</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The stakeholders differed in their opinion of how physicians should be  		compensated for the delivery of specialized nursing home care. Stakeholders who  		practiced in a model with physicians salaried by the nursing home agreed that  		this model afforded the physicians more time to devote to the care of the  		patients, but they recognized that payment to physicians under the salaried  		model could be less than in a model in which physicians bill Medicare Part B  		for their services.</p>
<p>Differences in opinion also were evident with regard to the ideal  		mixture of practice across settings of care. For example, one stakeholder felt  		it was essential for nursing home physicians to practice in outpatient clinics  		and hospitals and then follow patients from these settings to the nursing home  		to provide continuity of care. Others felt an office or hospital practice  		detracted from the physicians' ability to focus on nursing home patients  		because the physicians were often unavailable for calls during office hours and  		tended to see their nursing home patients as a last priority in evenings and on  		weekends. The non-physician stakeholders consistently reported difficulty  		communicating with physicians who care for only a very few nursing home  		residents because of the competing demands of physicians clinic and  		hospital-based practices.</p>
<p>Nursing facility staff members uniformly reported a preference for  		physician practice models that involve regular and frequent presence in the  		facility. These physicians were described as having a better understanding of  		the pressures faced by nursing homes and improved relationships with the  		nursing staff and interdisciplinary teams. Social workers valued models that  		allowed the physicians to become nursing home specialists and respond quickly  		to emergency calls. Staff members, and nursing home residents and their  		families, uniformly were pleased with working with nursing home physician  		specialists. No patterns in preferences for specific models of care were  		observed consistently across facility types.</p>
<p>Although the evidence is limited, there is some literature to support  		that specializing in the care of patients in one care setting improves quality  		of care and reduces costs. For example, patients who are cared for by  		physicians who specialize in the hospital setting, have lower mortality rates  		and reduced hospital costs.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> The literature also suggests that physicians  		who specialize in nursing home care are on-site at nursing homes more  		frequently, have quicker response times to emergencies, lower hospitalization  		rates, and reduced use of medications.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note7">7</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Stakeholders also alluded to the difficulty researchers may have in  		determining whether or not specialization results in better care. For example,  		if one utilizes a higher frequency of lab tests as an indicator of good medical  		care, there may be factors other than clinical acumen guiding the volume of  		tests. On one hand, a non-nursing home specialist may order more tests because  		they are not in the facility to perform an assessment and must instead rely  		heavily on lab tests to substitute for a clinical examination. Alternatively, a  		nursing home specialist physician may order more tests than non-nursing home  		specialists, in part, because he/she are concerned about lawsuits if tests are  		not ordered to support their clinical assessments. Similarly, one stakeholder  		commented that more visits from practitioners increased the volume of orders  		but it is unknown whether or not an increase in orders results in improved  		care. Thus, future investigations regarding the quality of care provided by  		specialist versus non-specialist nursing home physicians should use caution in  		the design of outcome variables.</p>
<p><b>Increasing Use of and Desire to Work with Mid-Level  		Practitioners</b></p>
<p>The literature review and most respondents indicated that mid-level  		practitioners have the potential to increase the quality of care provided to  		nursing home residents and provide an important service in nursing home  		physician practice models. Respondents indicated that operating an efficient,  		large nursing home medical practice is not possible without the use of  		mid-level practitioners. Mid-level practitioners were described as enabling  		physicians to provide more efficient care because of their ability to respond  		quickly to urgent care needs.</p>
<p>Current Medicare policy permits mid-level practitioners to alternate  		visits with physicians. However, a concern expressed by several respondents was  		that physicians relied too heavily on the mid-level practitioners and  		participated less in the care of patients when a mid-level practitioner was  		involved.</p>
<p>An additional concern expressed by respondents and reinforced by the  		literature was that while the overall supply of NPs has increased in the past  		decade, there are not enough geriatric-trained mid-level practitioners to meet  		the demand for these practitioners in nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note8">8</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> Reasons for this  		shortage are not well understood, but they may parallel the reasons cited in  		the literature and offered by respondents regarding the lack of  		geriatric-trained physicians (e.g., minimal exposure to nursing homes during  		training).</p>
<p><b>Information Exchange -- Knowledge About Nursing Home  		Operations</b></p>
<p>Stakeholders and the literature review suggest the need for enhanced  		communications and/or information exchange between physicians and nursing home  		staff, across settings of care and across providers of care (e.g.,  		communications among physicians, nursing homes, and laboratories).<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Issues and requirements that, in some instances, are unique to the  		nursing home setting and in other instances common across the health care  		continuum characterize medical service delivery in nursing homes. Persons  		treated in nursing homes often are severely functionally and cognitively  		impaired and/or medically complex, requiring intervention by interdisciplinary  		teams with substantial family/informal caregiver involvement.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note11">11</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note12">12</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> The literature provides evidence that  		transitions to and from nursing home care are a common occurrence and a major  		source of medical errors in relation to medication administration, advanced  		care directives, allergies, and delivery of essential services.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> An AMDA survey of 3,000  		sequential admissions to skilled nursing facilities from 25 different hospitals  		found the following: 22% of transfers had no formal summary of information;  		legible summaries were available only 56% of the time; secondary diagnoses were  		missing in 30% of transfers; test results were omitted in 31%-67% of transfers,  		advance directives and code status were absent in 81% of transfers; and a  		legible phone number for the transferring physician was present in only 33% of  		transfers.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The stakeholders also expressed similar concerns with respect to  		transitions from hospitals to nursing homes. They noted that transferring  		accurate medical information from one care setting to another is time-consuming  		and often inaccurate. This is because physicians often are not caring for  		patients across care settings, and there is no standardized process or standard  		set of information transferred across care settings to communicate health  		information. As observed by the stakeholders, nursing homes often are separated  		geographically from hospitals, diagnostic services, and physician offices,  		creating communication barriers that contribute to medical errors.</p>
<p>A common theme that emerged from discussions with stakeholders was the  		need for physicians to receive accurate and complete information regarding  		nursing home patients. Information transfer between hospital and nursing home  		stays were described as cumbersome and wrought with inaccurate and incomplete  		transfer of information. In most cases, the nursing facilities did not have  		computerized health information beyond the software used to record information  		for the Minimum Data Set. All stakeholders agreed that electronic medical  		records would vastly improve quality of care by reducing the inefficiencies  		involved with duplicating documentation that has occurred in other care  		settings and tracking down information.</p>
<h3>ISSUES REQUIRING FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND FUTURE  		RESEARCH</h3>
<p>The case presentations (<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>) provide  		examples of facilities with varied physician practice models and the issues  		related to each of these models. Several of these models offer promising  		approaches for improving physician care in nursing homes. This information  		could be useful when considering ways to promote effective and efficient  		medical service delivery to nursing home residents, to researchers in designing  		future studies examining physician practices in nursing homes, and to nursing  		homes and physicians in designing and implementing effective efficient  		physician practice models in nursing facilities.</p>
<p><b>Issues Requiring Further Consideration</b></p>
<p>Several overarching issues that arise from the literature review and  		stakeholder discussions that merit further consideration include availability  		of mid-level providers in long-term care (LTC). The literature review and  		stakeholder informants consistently suggested that mid-level providers are  		useful in extending medical services to nursing home residents and in promoting  		higher quality medical care to nursing home residents. However, these sources  		also discussed the limited supply of these mid-level providers. Other issues  		included physician training in geriatrics and nursing home care; and the need  		for incentives for enhancing physician care through pay-for-performance. </p>
<p><b><i>Availability of Mid-Level Providers in Long-Term Care</i></b></p>
<p>One strategy that has demonstrated success in attracting advanced  		practice nurses to LTC is the teaching nursing home concept in which schools of  		nursing establish affiliations with LTC facilities providing an advanced  		practice degree program for nurses with an emphasis in LTC. Funding specialty  		and advanced practice internship and residency programs for post degree  		recipients may also increase the availability of advanced practice nurses to  		nursing home care and help to provide a career ladder for nurses interested in  		positions of greater responsibility.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician Training in Geriatrics and Nursing Home Care</i></b></p>
<p>Strategies to stimulate physician practice in nursing homes may include  		modifications of the Medicare Graduate Medical Education program to provide  		direct and indirect funds to teaching hospitals in exchanges for placing an  		emphasis on training in nursing home care and/or geriatrics. Another approach  		may be to modify Medicare physician payment rules/methods to encourage  		physicians to provide services in nursing homes. Public Health Service training  		grants may also be structured in a manner that encourages medical education in  		geriatrics and nursing home care. Favorable student loan repayment programs for  		physicians who devote a significant proportion of their practice to nursing  		home care may also be established. Medical education could also incorporate  		exposure to nursing home patients for all internal medicine and family practice  		physician training programs.</p>
<p>The literature indicated few physicians are trained to provide care in  		nursing homes yet the literature and stakeholder informants indicate that when  		appropriately trained in the care of nursing home residents, physicians have an  		ability to effectively manage the frail, elderly population and improve  		outcomes. Stakeholders suggest that physicians who specialize in nursing home  		care are more proficient in understanding nursing home regulations and  		therefore are better able to respond to the medical needs of patients. However,  		the limited supply of physicians who are adequately trained to care for nursing  		home patients remains a challenge.</p>
<p><b><i>Incentive Payments for Medical Practices in Nursing  		Homes</i></b></p>
<p>Increasingly, purchasers of health care are interested in value-based  		purchasing. Recently legislation has been enacted to establish various  		pay-for-performance incentive programs to promote specific outcomes for  		physician practices. However, pay-for-performance incentive programs do not  		address clinically relevant outcomes for the frail institutionalized elderly.  		</p>
<p><b>Future Research</b></p>
<p>Currently, research is not available on features identified by  		stakeholders as important components of nursing home physician practice models.  		Specifically, the literature does not quantitatively or qualitatively address:  		(1) the efficacy of nursing home specialization, (2) effective strategies for  		information exchange between nursing homes and physicians or (3) methods to  		study physician payment incentives in nursing homes. Study designs are proposed  		for these topics. Recommendations related to specific research activities that  		would advance our knowledge related to physician practice in nursing homes  		include: (1) physician specialization in nursing home care and its impact on  		quality and costs; (2) health information transfer using technology across  		providers and settings when caring for nursing home patients; and (3)  		pay-for-performance incentives for physicians providing nursing home care. </p>
<p><b><i>Physician Specialization in Nursing Home Care</i></b></p>
<p>To study the effect of physician specialization in nursing homes an  		investigation could determine the extent to which quality indicators,  		influenced by physician practice, and avoidable hospitalizations are associated  		with the degree to which: (1) nursing homes are staffed by physicians who spend  		the majority of their practice caring for nursing home care patients  		(facility-level); and (2) a physician's practice is devoted to caring for  		nursing home residents (physician-level).</p>
<p><b><i>Health Information Transfer</i></b></p>
<p>Research could identify the issues that support or create barriers for  		information exchange and strategies that could facilitate information exchange,  		including electronic information exchange. The investigation would involve a  		literature review, stakeholder discussions and case studies examining how LTC  		organizations receive information, what information they receive when they  		serve patients that are treated by physicians and in hospitals that have the  		capacity to exchange health information electronically, and the factors that  		promote or inhibit electronic information exchange. ASPE is funding a study on  		health information exchange with post-acute and LTC settings.</p>
<p><b><i>Pay-for-Performance</i></b></p>
<p>A study could be developed under either Section 646 of the Medicare  		Modernization Act to establish a pay-for-performance demonstration program or,  		under an expanded demonstration program, to create physician incentive payments  		to promote high quality medical management by physicians and/or physician  		practice groups that include physician extenders on behalf of medically fragile  		nursing home patients. In developing pay-for-performance measures for nursing  		home care, the unique characteristics of nursing home residents and the  		environment of the nursing home must be taken into consideration. Such measures  		will apply specifically to the care of nursing home residents and not to a  		physician's outpatient population.</p>
<p>A study to pay for physician performance in skilled nursing facilities  		and nursing homes could test the effects of incentives for physicians (and  		their mid-level providers) to play a more active role in the care of their  		skilled nursing facility and nursing home residents. Process performance  		measures for physician and mid-level provider care in nursing homes could  		include timeliness of visits, responsiveness to phone calls from nursing home  		staff, and transfer of necessary information between a physician and nursing  		home staff. Outcome performance measures would need to target aspects of  		nursing home care over which the physician has the most influence. For example,  		use of unnecessary or inappropriate medications, untreated depression and pain,  		and rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations might be considered.</p>
<p>Medication data available under the Medicare Part D program could be  		used to evaluate physician prescribing for nursing home and skilled nursing  		facility residents and whether unnecessary medications or inappropriate  		medications were used. Hospitalization for potentially avoidable causes, such  		as urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, sepsis, wound infections,  		and conditions such as congestive heart failure where monitoring and early  		response might avoid the need for hospitalizing a resident, are potential  		performance measures for physician care. However, physicians are not solely  		responsible for hospitalization of nursing home residents, and thus these  		measures should be risk adjusted for resident as well as facility  		characteristics that research has found to be associated with preventable  		hospitalization rates (such as nursing home staffing).</p>
<p>Following standard treatment approaches for problems such as pain and  		depression also can be used as physician performance measures. If such  		conditions have been identified, treatment is appropriate. However, for some  		conditions following standard treatment guidelines typically used in outpatient  		medicine may not be the most appropriate treatment intervention for the elderly  		nursing home patient.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p>The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) contracted  		with the University of Colorado Health Services Center (UCHSC) to examine and  		describe models of physician practices in nursing homes; the financing  		arrangements and payment rates associated with these models; and determine what  		is known about the impact of physician practice models on the quality of care  		received by nursing home patients and on the quality of care provided in  		nursing homes. In addition, the UCHSC was asked to advance research designs  		that could be used to better understand major issues that emerge with different  		physician practice arrangements in nursing homes.</p>
<p>In the first phase of this project, the UCHSC completed a review of the  		literature related to physician practice patterns in nursing homes,  		including:</p>
<ul><li>Federal, state, and other requirements related to such practices;  		  </li>
<li>The extent to which medical schools and other programs prepare  		  physicians to practice in nursing homes; </li>
<li>The extent to which physicians practice and specialization in  		  providing services in nursing homes;</li>
<li>Barriers to physicians practicing in nursing homes including  		  reimbursement rates, scope of non-reimbursed activities, and impact on  		  malpractice premiums; </li>
<li>Alternative physician practice arrangements in nursing homes in  		  Medicare fee-for-service and managed care, including the use of physician  		  extenders; and</li>
<li>The impact of such arrangements on quality and costs.</li>
</ul><p>The second phase of the study involved case studies to further explore  		several issues that were not adequately addressed in the literature including  		the: </p>
<ul><li>Amount, duration, and scope of physician (and/or non-physician  		  provider) visits to nursing homes;</li>
<li>Perceived impact of physician (and/or non-physician provider) visits  		  to nursing homes;</li>
<li>Any issues/concerns that arise from the physician practice models and  		  financing arrangements; </li>
<li>Impact of physician services on the medical care of residents;  		  and</li>
<li>Use of health information technology (HIT) (including electronic  		  medical records) to support information exchange between physicians and  		  clinicians practicing in hospitals (and other settings) and clinicians in  		  nursing homes.</li>
</ul><h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Changes in Medicare payment policy (e.g., implementation of the acute  		care inpatient prospective payment policy) and in the availability of long-term  		care (LTC) alternatives (e.g., the growth in the assisted living industry) have  		led to a nursing home population that is increasingly frail and medically  		complex.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note16">16</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> With almost two million Americans currently  		residing in nursing homes and an expected increase to almost five million by  		2030, the need for physicians to practice in nursing homes will increase  		dramatically.<sup><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Physicians are responsible for the medical care for all nursing home  		residents. The increase in medical complexity of nursing home residents  		suggests the need for greater involvement of physicians to oversee medical  		care. However, the literature provides limited information about specific  		models for the delivery of medical care to nursing home residents that will  		help meet the needs of a growing and increasingly medically complex and frail  		nursing home population. </p>
<p>Federal regulations specify that physicians oversee the medical care for  		all residents of nursing homes and that they participate in the design of care  		plans for nursing home residents based upon the residents' current clinical  		conditions. Physicians are also required to evaluate and manage new medical  		conditions or symptoms. How physicians provide such oversight is not well  		described in the literature. The few studies available on physician practices  		in nursing homes suggest that physician presence is limited and that the  		majority of nursing home visits are made by a limited number of  		physicians.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> In a 1997  		survey completed by the American Medical Association, most physicians reported  		spending no time in treating nursing home patients (77%); and among physicians  		who did practice in nursing homes, most reported spending two hours or less per  		week caring for their nursing home patients.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> This lack of physician presence is reflected  		in many of the individual resident reports of dissatisfaction. Unattended  		symptoms, which include the failure to provide physician services for a change  		in condition, was the tenth most common complaint in 2000, up 44.4% from  		1996.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Against the backdrop of sicker patients needing more physician care is a  		physician workforce in nursing home care that may be shrinking. In a survey of  		physicians who provided nursing home care, 50% indicated that they planned to  		decrease their involvement in the care of nursing home residents.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note19">19</a></font></sup> Physicians planning to reduce  		their nursing home caseloads cited poor reimbursement by Medicare Part B for  		their services; a high volume of telephone calls from the nursing homes;  		onerous paperwork; and lack of physician authority in nursing homes as reasons  		for leaving the nursing home environment.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#method">Section II</a> of this report describes the methods  		that were used to select facilities and the market areas of interest. The  		Methods Section also describes the types of stakeholders with whom discussions  		were held and the type of information that was solicited from these  		stakeholders. <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendA">Appendix A</a> includes a copy of the  		discussion guides used for these discussions.</p>
<p><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#result">Section III</a> provides an overview of the findings  		that emerged from the case study and discusses the three primary issues that  		arose during discussions with informants. <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>  		summarizes the findings for each facility included in this study. </p>
<p><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#issue">Section IV</a> of this report discusses the issues and  		areas for possible future research related to physician practice in nursing  		homes.</p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method"> II. METHODS</a></h2>
<p>A purposeful sample of nursing facilities in selected markets was  		targeted to examine various physician practice models. No attempt was made to  		select a representative sample from which to draw statistical inferences.</p>
<p>Eight facilities were selected for case studies of physician practice  		models. This section describes methods used to: (1) select market, facility and  		practice model characteristics, (2) select stakeholders, and (3) create and  		administer the discussion guides. A summary of the facility and market  		characteristics of each selected facility can be found in <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#table1">Table 1</a>.</p>
<h3> SELECTION OF MARKET, FACILITY AND PRACTICE MODEL  		CHARACTERISTICS </h3>
<p>The literature review identified multiple market, facility and practice  		model characteristics related to access to and quality of nursing home  		physician care that we considered in selecting facilities and stakeholders. In  		addition, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) members reviewed these  		characteristics and described innovative physician practice models to  		target.</p>
<p>The following market characteristics were considered in selecting  		sites:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Managed care penetration -- The literature suggested differences in  			 access to and quality of physician services in nursing homes related to  			 coverage by a managed care or fee-for-service plan. Further, managed care has  			 disparate incentives for nursing homes due to the nature of capitated payments.  			 We examined nursing homes in two different managed care environments. First, a  			 nursing home that was populated primarily with health maintenance organization  			 (HMO) patients. Secondly, a nursing home that had a significant proportion of  			 patient in Evercare, a specialized capitated payment model designed  			 specifically for the institutionalized elderly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rural location -- Concerns identified in the literature and raised  			 by the TAG regarding access to care and the availability of specialized nursing  			 home/geriatric physicians led us to consider facilities in rural/semi-rural  			 communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geographic region -- The majority of published literature on  			 physician practice in nursing homes relies on research in two states, New York  			 and California. While these are the most populous states, we intentionally  			 chose facilities spread across the entire United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Litigious environment -- Recent literature suggests along with  			 increases in the price of medical malpractice insurance, physicians are more  			 likely to be listed as defendants in lawsuits against nursing homes than  			 previously reported. The availability and cost of malpractice insurance for  			 physicians who practice in nursing homes has been identified as a concern among  			 physicians and so we targeted a facility in Florida, a state with high rates of  			 malpractice claims.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The following facility characteristics were considered in selecting  		sites:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Ownership -- We intentionally selected facilities to represent the  			 three primary types of nursing home ownership: non-profit, for-profit, and  			 government owned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size -- Nursing homes vary widely in the number of residents they  			 house and we attempted to choose nursing homes with disparate bed  			 sizes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Both the literature and TAG members suggested the potential for a  		relationship between physician specialization and the quality of nursing home  		care. Specialization was often defined in different ways. Practice models were  		identified that represented the primary definitions of specialization. The  		following types of practice model specialization in nursing home care were  		considered in selecting sites:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Geriatrics/teaching -- This practice model placed a strong emphasis  			 on teaching and education in geriatrics. Three facilities were selected that  			 use this model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nursing home only practice -- This model is one in which the nursing  			 home is served by a physician practice devoted entirely to nursing home care.  			 We included one facility in which the practicing physicians care only for  			 nursing home patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting physician practitioners -- A prior research study suggested  			 closed panel facilities (i.e., facilities that generally limit attending  			 physicians to those that are salaried by the facility) provided higher quality  			 care. Alternatively, some facilities limit physician privileges to a small set  			 of community physicians. One facility that employs its own physicians and  			 another facility that limits the number of attending physicians were included  			 in this study. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other varied physician models -- In this model many physicians  			 practice in the facility and each physician cares for a panel of residents  			 ranging from a few to dozens of residents. No physician practice is devoted  			 entirely to nursing home care.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Participants of the project TAG provided referrals for two of the study  		sites with the characteristics of interest. Subsequent referrals for study  		sites with the market, facility and/or practice model characteristics of  		interest came through LTC practitioner contacts and Internet research on  		specific models of physician service delivery in nursing homes.</p>
<h3> SELECTION OF STAKEHOLDERS</h3>
<p><b>Stakeholder Disciplines</b></p>
<p>We identified stakeholders in each nursing home representing five  		specific disciplines and one variable staff member. Based on input from the  		TAG, each discipline was chosen based upon their participation in or unique  		view on the physician/patient relationship in nursing homes. Stakeholders  		included:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>A physician with patients in the nursing home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nursing home administrator who is responsible for providing  			 privileges for physicians to practice in their nursing home and also has final  			 responsibility for care received by their residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical directors who, often practice as attending physicians in the  			 nursing home they serve. They may also provide medical care that supplements  			 the care from a patients primary physician, or may be responsible for  			 disciplining physicians who do not meet an acceptable level of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director of nursing who observes physician practice and may have  			 the most direct contact with physicians and closest observation of their  			 patient interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social workers who may receive any complaints patients have  			 regarding their physician care and may act as liaisons between physicians and  			 patients or family members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A stakeholder for each facility was identified by other respondents  			 as an employee who would add valuable information to the discussions because of  			 their unique perspective on physician care in the facility. These included  			 nurses, nurse practitioners (NPs), a dietitian, an admission coordinator and  			 staff development personnel. The study team designated these respondents as  			 wild card employees.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>Stakeholder Recruitment</b></p>
<p>Once investigators were able to confirm a facilitys participation,  		individual stakeholders were identified and discussions were arranged.  		Stakeholders were contacted by e-mail, telephone or fax. Limitations to the  		recruitment process included non-response by several employees and low levels  		of technology available in facilities. Many facilities did not have e-mail  		addresses for their employees or voicemail boxes for individual staff  		members.</p>
<p>In cases where stakeholders in a facility were not available or willing  		to participate in the discussion, we sought an alternate from the facility.  		Specifically, in Facility 7, the nurse manager had extensive knowledge about a  		variety of physician practice patterns within the facility and was substituted  		for the physician interview in this facility.</p>
<p>In the cases where a suitable replacement was not available within the  		original facility being studied, we either located a participant who worked in  		a facility with the characteristics of interest or did not have responses from  		these respondent groups. Specifically:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>In Florida, a physician from the original study facility (Facility  			 5) was not available. A topic of interest in this facility was how nursing home  			 physician practice patterns are affected by living in state with a high rate of  			 lawsuits directed against nursing homes. As a replacement, we recruited another  			 physician who practices in nursing homes in Florida for the  			 discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Facility 1 (a facility in North Dakota), attempts to contact the  			 medical director and a physician respondent in this facility were unsuccessful.  			 Thus, a medical director and physician respondent are not included in responses  			 from the Facility 1. Discussions with the remaining respondents are retained in  			 this report because these respondents add important information regarding  			 nursing home physician practices in semi-rural regions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3> CREATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE DISCUSSION  		GUIDES</h3>
<p><b>Creation of Discussion Guides</b></p>
<p>Discussion guides were devised to gather information pertaining to  		physician practices in the selected nursing homes (<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendB">Appendix  		B</a>). To create the discussion guides, each of the investigators drafted  		sample questions thought to be relevant to and illustrative of physician  		practice patterns in nursing homes. The identified issues were then compared to  		identify major themes, redundancies, and crosscutting themes. Specifically, the  		discussions sought information in four areas: (1) qualifications and training  		of the practicing physicians and medical directors; (2) practice models and  		patterns used by physicians; (3) access to care associated with specific  		practice models; and (4) the quality of care provided in the practice models  		used in the facility.</p>
<p>Two types of discussion guides were then created to assist interviewers  		gather a consistent set of information from each stakeholder. The  		pre-discussion guide asked stakeholders' about the length of time they had  		worked in the nursing home industry, the training required to work in their  		current position and several questions about characteristics of the facility in  		which they worked. Stakeholders were instructed to complete the pre-discussion  		guide and fax it back to the investigators.</p>
<p>Discussion guides used during telephone discussions with the selected  		stakeholders addressed issues relevant to the vocational discipline of the  		stakeholder. For example, the discussion guide for the director of nursing  		asked questions that would only be relevant to his/her interactions with  		physicians as the director of nursing, whereas the discussion guide for a  		social worker asked a different set of questions relevant to the interactions  		social workers have with physicians in nursing homes. The wildcard discussion  		guide was designed after each of the specific discussion guides was designed.  		Investigators included a variety of issues that were relevant to experience  		with physician practice patterns. Because the wildcard could be any staff  		member working at the facility with knowledge of physician practice patterns,  		no questions were specific to any one discipline.</p>
<p>The discussion guides were pilot tested with each of the selected  		stakeholder disciplines at a local nursing facility located in Denver,  		Colorado, and were revised based on recommendations that emerged from the  		pilot. Some examples of revisions to the stakeholder discussion guides included  		placing questions regarding credentials and facility description in the  		discussion guide completed before the actual discussion. This was done to  		individually tailor each discussion, enable research staff to be more  		personable with the stakeholders, and ensure that questions were not repeated.  		Pilot testing resulted in including a statement at the beginning of each  		discussion to provide study background and, funding information, and a brief  		summary of anticipated results. Additionally, a clause was added that stated  		each discussion would be recorded for accuracy of transcription. In addition,  		some items that were identified as irrelevant or lacking in clarity were  		deleted or clarified. Staff in ASPE then reviewed the stakeholder discussion  		questions for approval.</p>
<p><b>Administration of Discussion Guides</b></p>
<p>After initial contact with the stakeholders was made, the study abstract  		was shared along with the pre-discussion guide. Once the stakeholder returned  		the completed pre-discussion guide, a telephone discussion was scheduled.  		(Copies of the stakeholder pre-discussion and discussion guides are presented  		in <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>.) Telephone discussions lasted 30-90  		minutes. During the discussions, no attempt was made to reconcile conflicting  		information from different respondents selected for the targeted facility.</p>
<h3>STUDY LIMITATIONS</h3>
<p>The limited number of sites and difficulties encountered in the process  		of recruiting stakeholders limit the extent to which one can generalize these  		findings to all nursing homes; however, several consistent themes emerged. As  		in much qualitative research this was a purposeful sample to examine specific  		practice models and markets. Thus, the study sites may be systematically  		different from the average nursing home due to both the sampling criteria and  		the selection bias between nursing homes that agreed to participate and those  		that declined. Primary reasons that facilities refuse to participate in the  		study included time and availability of staff; abundance of paperwork; facility  		in the middle of the survey process; key staff in training; and the belief that  		the facility would have little or no beneficial information to add to the  		study.</p>

<p>This project involved discussions with stakeholders from eight nursing  		facilities representing different physician practice models. The physician  		practice models reported at each of the targeted facilities appear to be shaped  		by several factors, including whether the facility is located in an area with a  		high managed care penetration rate; the facilitys geographic location  		(i.e., rural/urban); and the pervasiveness of liability concerns in the  		selected facility. The summary of discussions for each stakeholder as the  		selected facilities is found in <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>The case presentations provide examples of facilities with varied  		physician practice models and the issues related to each of these models. This  		information can be used when considering ways to promote effective and  		efficient medical service delivery to nursing home residents; researchers in  		designing future studies examining physician practices in nursing homes; and by  		nursing homes and physicians in designing and implementing effective efficient  		physician practice models in nursing facilities.</p>
<h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF FACILITIES AND PHYSICIAN  		RESPONDENTS</h3>
<p><b>Facility Characteristics</b></p>
<p>The facilities varied in the number of physicians who care for patients,  		the amount of time each physician spends in the facility and the number of  		patients followed (<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#table2">Table 2</a>). In the facilities selected  		for this case study, the number of beds ranged from 106 to 566 and the number  		of physicians seeing patients at each selected facility ranged from two to 50  		physicians. One facility sent laboratory studies and patients who needed X-rays  		to a hospital located one block from the facility; however, the majority of  		facilities used a mobile service to perform laboratory studies and X-rays in  		the facility. None of the facilities reported using a fully integrated  		electronic medical record. Two of the facilities had relationships with a  		university training program, and each facility had a unique combination of  		skilled nursing, custodial, intermediate, and specialized care units (e.g.,  		dementia and palliative care). While only one facility had been involved in a  		lawsuit, all of the facilities were concerned about the growing number of legal  		cases against nursing homes. All facilities utilized their medical directors to  		provide some level of direct physician care, at least in emergencies.</p>
<p>Generally, facilities reported that the medical director's role was  		primarily as a consultant, but also included quality improvement, quality  		assurance, training, and acting in a dual role as an attending physician. Four  		facilities consulted regularly with their medical directors on patients for  		whom the medical director was not the attending physician. All of the medical  		directors had an added certificate of qualification in geriatrics, and six of  		the eight medical directors were also certified medical directors.</p>
<p>Seven facilities reported that mid-level practitioners (such as  		physician assistants (PAs) and NPs) care for patients in the facility either as  		salaried employees of the nursing home or in partnerships with physicians. The  		one facility that did not have a mid-level provider is part of a corporation  		that is promoting the hire of mid-level providers as full-time employees and is  		anticipating adding at least one mid-level provider in the near future.</p>
<p><b>Physician Practice Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Physician characteristics and practice patterns in the nursing homes  		were very diverse (<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#table3">Table 3</a>). The percentage of time  		physicians devote to the care of nursing home residents ranged from 10% to 95%  		of their medical practice, and the average number of hours the physicians care  		for nursing home patients each week varied from five to 60 hours per week. The  		number of nursing homes served by each physician ranged from three to ten and  		the physicians interviewed care for up to 300 nursing home residents  		regularly.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the facilities and physician respondents for this  		study are presented in <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#table2">Table 2</a> and <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#table3">Table 3</a>.</p>
<h3> MAJOR THEMES</h3>
<p>Three issues emerged across stakeholder discussions regarding physician  		practice in nursing homes. These issues were the: </p>
<ol><li>Value of physician specialization in nursing home care; </li>
<li>Benefits of mid-level practitioners; and </li>
<li>Importance of information transfer.</li>
</ol><p>These issues are discussed below.</p>
<p><b>Physician Specialization in Nursing Home Care</b></p>
<p>The form of physician specialization in nursing homes varied, but most  		stakeholders clearly valued models of care that permitted physicians to  		specialize in the care of nursing home residents. The stakeholders did not have  		precise definitions for nursing home specialists. However, they generally  		defined physician specialization as physicians who spend a substantial portion  		of their time in the delivery of medical care to nursing home residents or have  		the majority of their patient caseload in nursing homes.</p>
<p>The benefits to the physicians who specialize in nursing home care were  		described as: (1) a reduction in overhead expenses associated with maintaining  		an office practice; (2) an ability to develop improved knowledge of regulations  		in nursing homes and effectively meet the needs of the nursing homes; (3)  		scheduling flexibility; and (4) the opportunity for long-term relationships  		with nursing home patients and families. Stakeholders felt that if medical  		students had a greater exposure to nursing home care during medical training,  		more physicians would select this career path. Based on the literature review,  		early exposure to the benefits of specializing in nursing home care can  		increase the number of physicians specializing in nursing home care.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Other benefits cited by stakeholders regarding specialist nursing home  		physicians included: (1) accessibility of medical staff to patients, family and  		nursing home staff; (2) improved knowledge of and sensitivity by physicians to  		challenges faced by nursing homes (e.g., regulations regarding use of  		anti-psychotics); and (3) enhanced medical management of common syndromes faced  		by nursing home residents (e.g., falls, urinary incontinence, agitated  		behaviors associated with dementia).</p>
<p>Nursing home regulatory requirements are unique and unlike the  		requirements in other health care arenas. The respondents associated lack of  		knowledge about these regulations with negative effects on physician  		communication with the nursing staff, medication ordering practices and  		compliance with required regulatory visits. Several respondents found the  		American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) certification program to be a  		valuable resource for information regarding regulatory requirements such as the  		use of physical and chemical restraints and required intervals for physician  		visitations. Sources identified in the literature review supported early  		exposure during medical training as a strategy to increase physician experience  		and familiarity with nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note2">2</a>,  		<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note3">3</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The model of physician specialization preferred by stakeholders varied.  		Some stakeholders favored a model that coupled physicians with mid-level  		providers (i.e., Evercare), others favored a closed physician practice model  		and still others preferred a model where physicians practice independently in  		multiple facilities. The closed models provided a salary to the physicians in  		contrast to other models in which physicians independently billed Medicare Part  		B. In the literature review, selected outcomes were superior in mid-level  		provider and closed models compared to the traditional independent physician  		practice model.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note5">5</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note6">6</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Proponents of the salaried-model indicated that this model afforded the  		physicians more time to devote to the care of the patients, but could be less  		financially lucrative to physicians in comparison to a model in which  		physicians independently bill Medicare Part B for their services. Stakeholders  		also reported that as the number of physicians practicing in a facility  		increased, communication challenges between the nursing home and attending  		physicians increased. As the number of physicians increase nursing home staff  		must remember and use each physicians preferred method of communicating  		(e.g., fax, telephone, e-mail, etc.) for different types of medical information  		(e.g., making available lab results, general medical questions, emergent  		situations).</p>
<p>Differences in opinion also were evident with regard to the ideal  		mixture of physician practice across settings of care. For example, one  		stakeholder felt it was essential for nursing home physicians to practice in  		outpatient clinics and hospitals and then follow patients from these settings  		to the nursing home to provide continuity of care. Others felt an office or  		hospital practice detracted from the physicians' ability to focus on nursing  		home patients because the physicians were often unavailable for calls during  		office hours and tended to see their nursing home patients as a last priority  		in evenings and on weekends. The stakeholders consistently reported difficulty  		communicating with physicians who care for only a very few nursing home  		residents because of the competing demands of their clinic and hospital-based  		practices.</p>
<p>Facility staff members uniformly reported a preference for physician  		practice models that involve regular and frequent physician presence in the  		facility. These physicians were described as having a better understanding of  		the pressures faced by nursing homes and improved relationships with the  		nursing staff and interdisciplinary teams. Social workers valued models that  		allowed the physicians to become nursing home specialists and respond quickly  		to emergency calls. Staff members, and nursing home residents and their  		families, uniformly were pleased with working with nursing home physician  		specialists. No patterns in preferences for specific models of care were  		observed consistently across facility types.</p>
<p>Although the evidence is limited, there is some literature to support  		that specializing in the care of patients in one care setting improves quality  		of care and reduces costs. For example, patients who are cared for by  		physicians who specialize in the hospital setting, have lower mortality rates  		and reduced hospital costs.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> The literature also suggests that physicians  		who specialize in nursing home care are on-site at nursing homes more  		frequently, have quicker response times to emergencies, lower hospitalization  		rates and reduced use of unnecessary medications.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note7">7</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Stakeholders also discussed the difficulty researchers may have in  		determining whether or not specialization results in better care. For example,  		if one utilizes a higher frequency of lab tests as an indicator of good nursing  		home care, there may be factors other than clinical acumen guiding the volume  		of tests. On one hand, a non-nursing home specialist may order more tests  		because they are not in the facility to perform an assessment and must instead  		rely heavily on lab tests to substitute for a clinical examination.  		Alternatively, a nursing home physician may order more tests than non-nursing  		home specialists, in part, because he/she are concerned about lawsuits if tests  		are not ordered to support their clinical assessments. Similarly, one  		stakeholder commented that more visits from practitioners increased the volume  		of orders but it is unknown whether or not an increase in orders results in  		improved care. Thus, future investigations regarding the quality of care  		provided by specialist versus non-specialist nursing home physicians should use  		caution in the design of outcome variables.</p>
<p><b>Increasing Use of and Desire to Work with Mid-Level  		Practitioners</b></p>
<p>The literature review and most respondents indicated that mid-level  		practitioners have the potential to increase the quality of care provided to  		nursing home residents and provide an important service in nursing home  		physician practice models. Respondents indicated that operating an efficient,  		large nursing home medical practice is not possible without the use of  		mid-level practitioners. Mid-level practitioners were described as enabling the  		delivery of more efficient care because of their ability to respond quickly to  		urgent care needs. However, a concern expressed by several respondents was that  		physicians relied too heavily on the mid-level practitioners and participated  		less in the care of patients when a mid-level practitioner was involved.</p>
<p>An additional concern expressed by respondents and reinforced by the  		literature was that there are not enough geriatric-trained mid-level  		practitioners to meet the demand for these practitioners in nursing  		homes.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> Reasons for this  		shortage are not well understood, but they may parallel the reasons cited in  		the literature and offered by respondents regarding the lack of  		geriatric-trained physicians (e.g., minimal exposure to nursing homes during  		training).</p>
<p><b>Information Exchange -- Knowledge About Nursing Home  		Operations</b></p>
<p>Stakeholders and the literature review suggest the need for enhanced  		communications and/or information exchange between physicians, nursing home  		staff, and across settings and providers of care (e.g., communications among  		physicians, nursing homes and laboratories).<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Medical service delivery in nursing homes is characterized by issues and  		requirements that, in some instances, are unique to the nursing home setting  		and in other instances common across the health care continuum. Persons treated  		in nursing homes often are severely functionally and cognitively impaired  		and/or medically complex, requiring intervention by interdisciplinary teams  		with substantial family/informal caregiver involvement.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note11">11</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note12">12</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> The literature provides evidence that  		transitions to and from nursing home care are a common occurrence and a major  		source of medical errors in relation to medication administration, advanced  		care directives, allergies, and delivery of essential services.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> An AMDA survey of 3,000  		sequential admissions to skilled nursing facilities from 25 different hospitals  		found the following: 22% of transfers had no formal summary of information;  		legible summaries were available only 56% of the time; secondary diagnoses were  		missing in 30% of transfers; test results were omitted in 31%-67% of transfers,  		advance directives and code status were absent in 81% of transfers; and a  		legible phone number for the transferring physician was present in only 33% of  		transfers.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The stakeholders also expressed similar concerns with respect to  		transitions from hospitals to nursing homes. They noted that transferring  		medical information from one care setting to another is time-consuming and  		information exchanged is often inaccurate. This is because physicians often do  		not follow their patients across care settings. As observed by the  		stakeholders, nursing homes often are separated geographically from hospitals,  		diagnostic services, and physician offices, creating communication barriers  		that contribute to medical errors. In addition, physicians often do not care  		for patients across care settings, and there is no standardized process or  		agreed upon set of information to support transfers across care settings.</p>
<p>A common theme that emerged from discussions with stakeholders was the  		need for physicians to receive accurate and complete information regarding  		nursing home patients. Information transfer between hospital and nursing home  		stays was described as cumbersome and wrought with inaccurate and incomplete  		transfer of information. In most cases, the facilities did not have  		computerized medical records beyond the software used to record information for  		the Minimum Data Set (MDS). All stakeholders agreed that electronic medical  		records would vastly improve quality of care by reducing the inefficiencies  		involved with tracking down and recording information at times of transfer and  		discharge.</p>

<p>The findings from the stakeholder interviews in the context of extant  		literature suggest several important issues for further consideration as well  		as some areas for future research. In this section, we first discuss issues in  		three areas, followed by recommendations related to two specific research  		activities that would advance our knowledge related to physician practice in  		nursing homes. The issues to be discussed include: (1) availability of  		mid-level providers in LTC; (2) physician training in geriatrics and nursing  		home care; and (3) providing incentives for enhancing physician care through  		pay-for-performance.</p>
<p>Areas requiring further research where our findings and consensus  		suggest the potential to improve physician care in nursing homes include: (1)  		physician specialization in nursing home care and its impact on quality and  		costs; (2) health information transfer using technology across providers and  		settings when caring for nursing home patients; and (3) physician  		pay-for-performance incentives for care in nursing homes. These issues and  		research topics are discussed below.</p>
<h3>ISSUES REQUIRING FURTHER CONSIDERATION</h3>
<p><b>Availability of Mid-Level Providers in Long-Term Care</b></p>
<p>NPs and PAs have been shown to enhance the care of LTC  		residents,<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note5">5</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note21">21</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note22">22</a>,  		<a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note23">23</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> which was  		further supported by our stakeholder interviews. NPs and PAs make urgent  		resident visits, provide preventive care to long-stay residents, often provide  		specialty services such as hospice care and wound care, and help educate  		nursing staff working in nursing homes. Different models exist for involving  		mid-level practitioners in LTC either as employees of the nursing facilities or  		employees of physician practices. Current policy permits mid-level  		practitioners to alternate visits with physicians.</p>
<p>Given the evidence in support of the value of NPs and PAs in LTC, a  		major issue relates to the barriers that exist to greater involvement of  		mid-level practitioners in nursing home care. One such obstacle appears to be  		dissemination of the different types of practice models that are possible for  		involving NPs and PAs in LTC facilities and obtaining reimbursement for their  		salaries. Because of the differences in payers, nursing facilities, and  		markets, a single model is not optimal in all settings. For example, facilities  		in states with higher Medicaid rates are more able to pay for mid-level  		practitioners as salaried nursing home staff, whereas managed care programs can  		hire NPs using Medicare-risk dollars that are offset by a reduction in  		hospitalization of nursing home residents. Additionally, physician practice  		groups may be more receptive to providing medical services to nursing home  		residents if they are more aware of Medicare coverage rules and payment rates  		for NP service, and the benefits of these NP services to both physician  		practices and nursing facility residents. Thus, dissemination of practice model  		and reimbursement information may help to stimulate providers to seek out  		mid-level practitioners.</p>
<p>Three ongoing initiatives are describing practice models of advanced  		practice nurses in LTC facilities. These three include: (1) a national survey,  		conducted in collaboration with AMDA, to determine the number of geriatric NPs  		caring for residents in nursing homes, and to describe the characteristics of  		this practice; (2) a summary of existing advanced practice nursing models in  		LTC, including the structure of existing practice models, types of  		collaboration with physicians and other health care professionals,  		state-to-state variation in practice acts/actual practice, obstacles to  		practice, reimbursement methodology and any measured outcomes,<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> and (3) an invitational  		conference/symposium sponsored by the American Association of Colleges of  		Nursing to disseminate information on and training material for NP and PA  		services in nursing homes and to provide a forum to share information and  		discuss strategies.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note25">25</a></font></sup>  		Information from these initiatives could be disseminated to nursing facilities  		and physician groups and also to guide recommendations regarding recruitment,  		training, and retention of geriatric advance practice nurses in nursing  		homes.</p>
<p>An additional barrier identified in the literature and by stakeholders  		relates to the size of the NP and PA workforce, and in particular the funding  		and training of those who are interested in LTC. Specifically, an issue is the  		adequacy of the supply of NPs and PAs who have been trained in either  		geriatrics or nursing home care. One strategy that has demonstrated success in  		attracting advanced practice nurses to LTC is the teaching nursing home concept  		in which schools of nursing establish affiliations with LTC facilities  		providing an advanced practice degree program for nurses with an emphasis in  		LTC. These affiliations have not only been shown to improve quality of care in  		the nursing facilities but to increase the number of advance practice nurses  		with experience and interest in LTC.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note26">26</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note27">27</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Physician Training in Geriatrics and Nursing Home Care</b></p>
<p>Stakeholders indicated that physicians exposed to nursing home care  		during their medical training were more likely to include nursing home patients  		in their practice. In addition, stakeholders preferred working with physicians  		who dedicated a significant proportion of their practice to nursing home care  		because these physicians were more responsive to acute changes in condition and  		more attentive to issues and conditions of greatest concern to nursing homes  		and nursing home patients. Sources identified in the literature review  		supported early exposure during medical training as a strategy to increase  		physician experience and familiarity with nursing homes, and increase the  		number of physicians practicing in this setting.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note2">2</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note3">3</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> Further, the literature indicates that  		physicians who specialize in nursing home care are on-site at nursing homes  		more frequently, have quicker response times to emergencies, lower  		hospitalization rates, and reduced use of medications.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note7">7</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most physicians who train in geriatrics are exposed to nursing home care  		and learn about the clinical issues faced in the nursing home setting. However,  		only three of the nation's 145 medical schools have geriatrics departments, and  		less than 10% of medical schools require a geriatrics course.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> In 2002, out of 7,765  		accredited specialty programs, only 97 were in geriatric medicine. Of these 97  		programs, there were 333 residency slots, which make up less than 0.3% of all  		residency slots reported by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical  		Education. Of the more than a half million licensed physicians practicing in  		the United States, fewer than 9,000 have met qualifying criteria in geriatrics  		-- which amounts to roughly 2.5 qualified geriatricians to every 10,000 older  		adults.</p>
<p>With so few trained geriatricians, most nursing home care is provided by  		physicians who are not geriatrics specialists. Most of the physicians who  		provide nursing home care as part of their practices are family physicians or  		internists with no specialized training either in nursing home care or in  		geriatrics.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Supporting nursing home education to physicians-in-training would target  		both medical students and resident physicians. Exposure of both medical  		students and resident physicians to nursing home care would have several  		benefits. First, this education, by virtue of exposure, would improve  		recruitment efforts of physicians into the nursing home workforce. Second, for  		physicians who do not later develop a nursing home practice, this education  		would improve their understanding of the challenges and limitations of  		providing care in nursing homes, thereby improving care transitions from acute  		care and outpatient settings to nursing homes.</p>
<p><b>Incentive Payments for Medical Practice in Nursing Homes</b></p>
<p>Increasingly, health care payers are looking towards value-based  		purchasing as a tool to improve the quality and efficiency of care. </p>
<p>Medicare is implementing pay-for-performance programs for physicians to  		support better care by sharing the savings from quality improvements to  		Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Section 412 of the Benefits Improvement  		and Protection Act of 2000 mandated the Medicare Physician Group Practice (PGP)  		Demonstration. During this demonstration project, the Centers for Medicare and  		Medicaid Services (CMS) rewards physician groups that improve patient outcomes.  		The performance measures used in this demonstration are ambulatory care  		measures that measure improvements in community-based medical practices. </p>
<p>In addition, Section 646 of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA)  		requires CMS to establish a demonstration program to improve quality of care  		while increasing efficiency across an entire health care system. In response to  		this provision, CMS has initiated a competitive process to select eight to 12  		PGPs, integrated health care delivery systems, and regional coalitions to  		participate in this demonstration. Initial proposals for the "Medicare Health  		Care Quality" (MHCQ) demonstration program were received by January 30, 2006.  		For the second phase, to be considered, proposals must be received by September  		29, 2006.</p>
<p>CMS recently announced that it will make available the shared savings  		payment model and quality measurement and reporting processes used in the PGP  		Demonstration to second phase applicants to the MHCQ demonstration program.  		</p>
<p>Neither the PGP Demonstration nor the MHCQ demonstration programs focus  		on improving the medical management of patients in nursing homes. The  		performance measures used in the PGP Demonstration are not always appropriate  		metrics for the medical management of a frail institutionalized population. In  		addition, the statute limits the scope of the MHCQ demonstration. Specifically,  		Section 646 of the MMA statute defines an integrated health care delivery  		system as one that coordinates care through hospitals, clinics, home health  		agencies, ambulatory surgery centers, skilled nursing facilities,  		rehabilitation facilities and clinics, and employed, independent, or contracted  		physicians. Thus, while the MHCQ demonstration proposals could include a focus  		on improving the medical management of patients residing in skilled nursing  		facilities, these proposals cannot include incentives to improve the medical  		management of patients in long-term nursing facility stays. </p>
<h3>FUTURE RESEARCH</h3>
<p><b>Assessing the Impact of Physician Specialization in Nursing Homes on  		Quality of Care and Medical Costs of Care for Nursing Home Residents</b></p>
<p>A growing number of physicians are specializing in service delivery in  		nursing homes. While many of the stakeholders believe that quality of care to  		nursing home residents is enhanced through physician specialization, there is  		only limited, empirical evidence to support these views. The extent of nursing  		home specialization and the degree to which physicians specialize in nursing  		home practice (e.g., the percentage of physicians Medicare claims made on  		behalf of nursing home residents) also has never been described. If  		specialization is found to improve quality of care, pay-for-performance  		incentives may be developed to expand this practice model.</p>
<p>A future project could examine the association between degree of  		physician specialization (controlling for patient, facility and market factors)  		and nursing home quality indicators and avoidable hospitalization rates among  		nursing home residents. The study will involve a facility-level analysis to  		determine if the quality indicators most directly effected by physician  		practices are different in facilities where most physicians have medical  		practices devoted to the care of nursing home residents. In addition, the study  		will involve a physician-level analysis to determine if avoidable  		hospitalizations for the patients of a given physician differ depending on the  		proportion of clinical care the physician devotes to nursing home care.  		Physician specialization will be measured as the percent of a physician claims  		made on behalf of nursing home residents. Rates and costs of avoidable  		hospitalizations will be measured and compared across physicians. Physician  		claims will be stratified by the:</p>
<ol><li>percent of physicians Medicare claims for treating nursing home  		  patients, and</li>
<li>percent of physicians Medicare claims by number of nursing  		  homes in which each physician saw patients.</li>
</ol><p><b><i>Methods</i></b>: One year Medicare Part B physician reimbursement  		data with one of eight billing codes unique to nursing home care will be  		selected for inclusion in the analysis of all data from five states.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note31">31</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note32">32</a>, <a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> These unique codes will serve to identify  		physicians who care for nursing home residents. The codes will be linked to the  		Medicare provider number for each physician. Physicians who provided nursing  		home care would be stratified by quartiles based on the number of nursing home  		claims in the prior year as a percentage of all their Medicare Part B claims.  		The files then will be linked to Medicare Provider Analysis and Review hospital  		claims data, nursing facility attribute data from the Online Survey  		Certification and Reporting file, the MDS, and Area Resource File data.  		Facility identification numbers will be obtained from all claims and from  		linked MDS data, and a physician specialization index will be calculated for  		each facility based on the number of patients each physician cared for in a  		given facility, weighted by their degree of specialization (calculated using  		quartiles of specialization). Facilities will then be classified by the degree  		of physician specialization within the facility. Utilizing MDS data for  		diagnostic information and risk adjustment, quality indicators related to  		physician practice and potentially avoidable hospitalizations will be  		identified for all physicians and all facilities included in the analysis.</p>
<p><b><i>Analysis</i></b>: Two analyses will be performed. One will  		determine the association between quality indicators that are potentially  		affected by physician practice models and the degree of nursing home  		specialization. The second analysis will determine the association between  		avoidable hospitalizations and the degree of nursing home specialization.</p>
<p>Eight nursing home quality indicators will be utilized to assess  		differences in quality based on the degree of physician specialization in the  		facility. The quality indicators will include the following: use of nine or  		more different medications; moderate to severe daily pain; prevalence of  		symptoms of depression without anti-depressant therapy; prevalence of  		anti-anxiety/hypnotic use; prevalence of hypnotic use more than two times in  		last week; prevalence of anti-psychotic use, in the absence of psychotic or  		related conditions; prevalence of indwelling catheters; and use of physical  		restraints.</p>
<p>Five hospital transfer measures will be utilized to assess the quality  		of care. The primary outcome variable for this analysis will be avoidable  		hospitalizations. This outcome variable will include hospitalization for:  		congestive heart failure, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory infections,  		urinary tract infections, and sepsis.<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note34">34</a></font></sup> These hospital transfer measures were  		developed for a prior investigation involving nursing home quality related to  		nurse staffing ratios.</p>
<p><b><i>Facility-level variables in the analysis will include</i></b>:  		size, location, rural/urban designation, ownership (i.e., for-profit chain,  		for-profit non-chain, government owned and non-profit), and affiliation (i.e.,  		hospital-based or freestanding). Patient-level variables extracted from MDS  		will include: age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, primary diagnosis,  		co-morbid illnesses, body mass index (calculated from height and weight),  		functional status, cognitive status, length of stay and advance directives.</p>
<p>A series of regression analyses will be utilized to determine the  		contribution of physician specialization in nursing home care on quality  		indicators and avoidable hospitalization rates relative to patient, facility,  		and market-level risk factors for nursing home quality and avoidable  		hospitalizations. The primary outcome variables will be modeled using  		multilevel multinomial logistic regression. Analyses will be performed at the  		physician provider and facility-level to determine: (1) if quality indictors  		differ between facilities with physicians in different quartiles of nursing  		home specialization, (2) if avoidable hospitalization rates differ between  		physicians in different quartiles of nursing home specialization, and (3) if  		avoidable hospitalization rates differ in facilities with a high degree of  		specialization among the physicians who care for residents in the facility.</p>
<p>Payment will be assessed using Medicare payment amount derived from  		Medicare claims. For the utilization and Medicare payment analysis, only  		patients receiving skilled nursing facility care under the Medicare Part A  		benefit will be studied. Due to significant variations in Medicaid payment  		schemes across states, an analysis including patients receiving Medicaid is  		beyond the scope of the proposed analysis. Nursing home payments will be based  		on Resource Utilization Group categories and hospital payments derived from  		Diagnostic Related Group payments. Using multivariate analysis, payment will be  		risk adjusted for patient and facility variables that are associated with cost  		of care. The average daily payment for care will be calculated for a nursing  		home versus a hospital stay. Following a review of the average nursing home and  		hospital payment distributions, outliers will be removed to normalize the  		distribution. Total hospital costs will be calculated for all avoidable  		hospitalizations for each of the four physician specialization strata during  		the one-year time period, adjusting for case mix.</p>
<p><b>Improving Information Exchange Through the Use of Health Information  		Technology</b></p>
<p>Increasingly HIT is recognized as a tool that can facilitate information  		exchange and communication across unaffiliated settings of care and between  		clinicians and patients. However, even in health delivery systems that use HIT  		and electronic health records, sometimes these tools are not used to exchange  		health information across affiliated and unaffiliated providers (such as  		long-tem care providers).<sup><font><a href="physician-practices-nursing-homes-final-report.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A study could be undertaken to understand the: (1) types of health  		information that is needed to be exchanged between health care providers (e.g.,  		hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, labs, etc.) and post-acute care (PAC) and  		LTC settings, particularly those PAC and LTC providers that are unaffiliated  		with the hospital and/or physician practices, (2) mechanisms used to exchange  		that information (including the types of HIT being used to support the  		creation, storage, and exchange of needed information), and (3) factors that  		support or create barriers to the timely exchange of needed health  		information.</p>
<p><b><i>Methods</i></b>: This investigation will integrate information  		from a literature review, stakeholder discussions and site visits to describe  		particular/common instances requiring the exchange of needed health information  		for persons needing PAC and LTC; the type of information needed to be  		exchanged; how this information is exchanged (including whether HIT is used to  		support the exchange), the timeliness of the information exchange, and the  		factors that promote or limit timely health information exchange.</p>
<p><b><i>Literature Review</i></b>: A review of the published and  		unpublished literature related to information exchange needed in nursing homes  		will include a review of: articles on the types of information exchange needed  		to support care delivery to persons receiving nursing home care and home health  		care, what is known about the extent to which needed information is exchanged  		in a timely manner, the extent to which electronic health information systems  		are being used to produce and/or receive needed health information, and the  		factors that support or hinder the timely exchange (including electronic  		exchange) of needed information to and from PAC and LTC providers; and any  		regulatory, licensure, certification, and/or accreditation requirements for  		information exchange to and from nursing home providers.</p>
<p><b><i>Stakeholders Discussions</i></b>: Discussions with persons  		knowledgeable about health information exchange and electronic health  		information exchange including to and from PAC and LTC settings will be  		conducted. Topics will include: types of health information needed to be  		exchange in nursing homes; extent to which HIT is being used to support the  		exchange of the needed information; factors that support or hinder the exchange  		of needed information and the options that could be considered to promote such  		exchange.</p>
<p><b><i>Site Visits</i></b>: Site visits will be conducted to: (1) health  		delivery systems (i.e., physicians, hospitals, and possibly lab and/or pharmacy  		services) that use HIT; and (2) PAC/LTC providers. The PAC/LTC providers that  		will be included are those that:</p>
<ul><li>serve patients who are treated by physicians and in hospitals and may  		  receive laboratory and/or pharmacy services from the selected health delivery  		  system; and</li>
<li>may or may not electronically exchange needed health information to  		  and from the selected health delivery system.</li>
</ul><p>Stakeholder discussions will be conducted to obtain information on: the  		hardware, software, and architecture used by the health delivery system to  		create, store, and exchange health information and the timing of the  		transmission of needed health information to and from PAC and LTC providers;  		organizational, cultural, and technological barriers confronted when  		transmitting health information to nursing home providers and how these  		barriers have been addressed; and next steps that could be pursued to promote  		the exchange health information between PAC and LTC providers and health  		delivery systems that use HIT.</p>
<p>ASPE is funding a study on health information exchange with PAC and LTC  		settings.</p>
<p><b>Incentive Payments for Medical Practice in Nursing Homes </b></p>
<p>Given the quality of care issues present in nursing homes, the  		increasing medical complexity of nursing home patients, the limited number of  		physicians, NPs and PAs who practice in nursing homes, and the current focus on  		pay-for-performance measures in community-based practices, the study of  		effective physician practice in nursing homes is imperative. </p>
<p>A study to pay for physician performance in skilled nursing  		facility/nursing homes could test the effects of incentives for physicians (and  		their NPs and PAs) to play a more active role in the care of their skilled  		nursing facility/nursing facility residents. Process performance measures for  		physician and physician extender care in nursing homes could include timeliness  		of visits to skilled nursing facility/nursing facility residents,  		responsiveness to phone calls from nursing home staff, and transfer of  		necessary information between a physician and nursing home staff. Outcome  		performance measures would need to target aspects of nursing home care over  		which the physician has the most influence. For example, use of unnecessary or  		inappropriate medications, untreated depression and pain, and rates of  		potentially avoidable hospitalizations might be considered.</p>
<p>The current pay-for-performance demonstration models do not provide  		incentives for physician and/or physician practice groups that include NPs and  		PAs to improve the medical management of long-term nursing home residents. A  		study could be developed either under Section 646 demonstration program or  		under an expanded demonstration program to create physician incentive payments  		to promote high quality medical management by physicians and/or physician  		practice groups that include NPs and PAs on behalf of medically fragile nursing  		home patients. The Section 646 demonstration could include only the nursing  		home residents in a Part A covered skilled nursing facility stay. An expanded  		demonstration program could include physician and physician practice group  		management of all nursing facility residents. A study of physician  		pay-for-performance in skilled nursing facility and nursing homes could test  		the effects of physician incentives. </p>
<p>Process data could be obtained either from claims or from the nursing  		home. For example, timeliness of physician and physician extenders visits in  		accordance with federal regulations (every 30 days for the first 90 days and  		then every 60 days thereafter) could be obtained from billing data. However,  		additional information could be obtained from the nursing home staff on whether  		urgent physician and mid-level provider visits were made in a timely manner.  		Similarly, nursing home staff could provide information on timeliness with  		which physicians and mid-level providers returned phone calls and whether  		necessary orders and other information was received from physicians in a timely  		fashion. These data could feed into a measure of care coordination between the  		physician and their group practice, and the nursing home.</p>
<p>Medication data available under the Medicare Part D program could be  		used to evaluate physician prescribing for nursing home and skilled nursing  		facility residents and whether unnecessary medications or inappropriate  		medications were used. Criteria exist for minimizing the use of medications  		that increase risks of falls and confusion in older persons, such as  		benzodiazepines, unless there is a specific diagnosis for which the medication  		is most appropriate. Other medications with side effects that could be replaced  		by a medication that is more easily tolerated in elders, as well as dosing that  		does not take into consideration compromised renal function in older persons  		could also be used for pay-for-performance.</p>
<p>Physicians do influence hospitalization rates based on their decisions  		to visit patients in the facility and initiate treatment early when problems  		are first identified. Hospitalization for potentially avoidable causes, such as  		urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, sepsis, wound infections, and  		conditions such as congestive heart failure where monitoring and early response  		might avoid the need for hospitalizing a resident, are potential performance  		measures for physician care. However, physicians are not solely responsible for  		hospitalization of nursing home residents, and thus these measures should be  		risk adjusted to take into account facility characteristics that research has  		found to be associated with preventable hospitalization rates (such as nursing  		home staffing). These measures and risk adjustors are available from claims and  		MDS.</p>
<p>Following standard treatment approaches for problems such as pain and  		depression also can be used as physician performance measures. If such  		conditions have been identified, treatment is appropriate. However, for some  		conditions following standard treatment guidelines may not always be the most  		appropriate treatment intervention for the elderly nursing home patient.  		Management of diabetes for an elderly nursing home resident is an example of  		when widely accepted community-based standards of practice may contraindicated.  		Aggressive diabetic management to reduce hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may  		not be appropriate for the nursing home patient. The long-range complications  		related to chronically elevated glucose (e.g., kidney failure, blindness, nerve  		damage) are of less concern in an elderly nursing home patient because they may  		take years to develop, while a single hypoglycemic episode (low blood sugar)  		may result in death; suggesting less aggressive management of hyperglycemia is  		appropriate. Thus, hemoglobin A1c is not the most appropriate performance  		measure for elderly diabetic persons in a long-term nursing facility stay,  		whereas it may be for individuals residing in the community.</p>
<p>Therefore, in developing physician pay-for-performance measures for  		nursing home care, the unique characteristics of nursing home residents and the  		environment of the nursing home must be taken into consideration. Such measures  		will apply specifically to the care of nursing home residents and not to a  		physician's outpatient population.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="appendB" id="appendB">APPENDIX B. CASE STUDY FINDINGS BY FACILITY</a></h2>
<h3>FACILITY 1 -- THE SEMI-RURAL PHYSICIAN PRACTICE  		MODEL</h3>
<p>Facility 1 is a 106 bed, for-profit chain facility located in Minot, ND.  		Stakeholder discussions included discussions with the nursing home  		administrator, social worker and director of nursing practicing in this  		facility. After unsuccessful attempts at contacting the medical director and  		physicians practicing in the originally selected facility, responses were not  		obtained for these two groups of respondents. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: The administrator described a  		health care work force in this semi-rural area that is affected by geographic  		isolation. While there are some physicians who are "lifers" and tend to stay in  		the area for their entire careers, the majority of physicians live in the  		community only a few years. This results in constant physician turnover. The  		nurses have better retention rates than the physicians, and they do not tend to  		move as frequently. The administrator said that physicians do not spend enough  		time with residents due to poor reimbursement and what he perceived as a  		generalized disinterest in geriatrics. This facility is considering a  		requirement of physicians to demonstrate some type of continued involvement  		with the facility. He envisions a monthly lunch or training session which would  		facilitate improved communication and a better understanding of changes and  		trends in the provision of nursing home care. He hopes to engage physicians in  		nursing home care by helping them to understand federal regulations that guide  		care in nursing homes and to make it a priority, rather than a duty, for them.  		However, he cautions that increasing expectations of physicians may cause some  		to completely lose interest in working in nursing homes. He also believes that  		nurse practitioners are an asset to long-term care, but that the physician  		community is not willing to accept them because they feel threatened by nurse  		practitioners. </p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: The semi-rural nature of this  		facility has led to a close association with the towns only hospital,  		which is only one block from the facility. The hospital proximity means that  		physicians are accessible for visits when a residents condition changes.  		The facility made a concerted effort to educate the physicians on exactly what  		level of medical acuity they can manage reasonably in the nursing home and  		following this intervention, the physicians have similar hospitalization rates.  		However, the director of nursing indicated that he and the nursing home  		residents would appreciate more frequent routine physician visits. He reported  		that malpractice is not a primary concern because lawsuits are not prevalent in  		this region.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker in this facility  		interacts with the physicians and their mid-level practitioners mainly during  		discharge planning, obtaining signatures on advance care directives and  		communicating patient and family concerns. The social worker does not interact  		routinely with the medical director, but easily can contact him when assistance  		with physician care is needed. The social worker reports that one physician is  		highly regarded by staff, patients, and families, and she attributes this  		respect to his frequent presence in the facility. The physician's rapport with  		the patients and facility staff were cited as the reason most patients and  		families are satisfied. The social worker reported that most physicians spend  		approximately 30 minutes or less in the facility each week. She feels this is  		inadequate to address the complexities involved with each case but that the  		demands of practicing in a non-urban setting where doctors balance clinic and  		hospital patients with nursing home patients, more extensive involvement in  		nursing home care is not possible. </p>
<h3>FACILITY 2 -- THE RURAL OPEN PHYSICIAN PRACTICE  		MODEL</h3>
<p>Facility 2 was a rural, 204-bed non-profit, privately owned facility in  		rural Michigan. There are nine physicians who care for residents in the  		facility. The administrator, director of nursing, medical director, social  		worker, a physician and an assistant medical director participated in the  		stakeholder discussions. Despite the remote location, the facility has  		developed relationships with the medical and nursing schools at a university  		such that there is a constant stream of medical students and  		university-affiliated physicians rotating through the facility. This facility  		recently received a grant to study the effects of having a telemedicine  		connection to geriatric physicians at the University of Michigan for nursing  		home consultations. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: The administrator has  		extensive experience in nursing homes as a nurse, director of nursing and  		surveyor. She has cultivated unique opportunities for this rural facility that  		have contributed to a very high degree of nursing and physician staff retention  		and physician satisfaction. She reports that the primary physicians have  		developed a schedule such that one physician is in the facility every weekday.  		Because of the physician's involvement in education, a lab was built in the  		facility for training purposes. The administrator cites physician ignorance  		about nursing home regulations (e.g., requirements for physician visitation and  		regulations on use of psychotropic medications) as the biggest barrier to good  		physician care. She believes that knowledge about nursing home operations and  		regulations is more useful than any one type of practice model.</p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: The director of nursing began her  		career as a certified nursing assistant. She then obtained additional training  		to become a licensed practical nurse and, ultimately, a registered nurse. She  		believes that her experience in each of these roles allows her to be more  		effective. She has been in nursing home care for 38 years -- all in the same  		facility. </p>
<p>The director of nursing described two significant changes in nursing  		home physician practice during her career. Patients are much sicker now  		compared to when she started working in nursing homes, resulting in an  		increased need for physician oversight in the care of nursing home residents.  		She also has observed that family expectations have increased; with families  		expecting care similar to the care delivered in hospitals where physicians  		visit daily and nurses have a lower nurse-to-patient ratio. Families become  		disgruntled when they realize that the intensity of care is lower in the  		nursing home, leading to litigious overtones and the necessity for both the  		facility and the physician to practice defensive medicine by  		ordering more tests and having a lower threshold for hospitalization.</p>
<p>The director of nursing reported that physicians in the facility spend  		anywhere from one to six hours at the facility daily, with the  		university-affiliated physicians spending the most time caring for patients.  		She described the ideal physician practice model as a model that allowed  		physicians to be in the facility for several hours each day to address acute  		clinical issues. Their practices should be dedicated to long-term care because  		having an office practice impedes the physician from regularly visiting acutely  		ill residents. She feels that all nursing home physicians should have  		specialized training in geriatrics and obtain certification as a medical  		director of a nursing facility. Otherwise, they are not sensitive to the unique  		needs of the patients or to the regulatory requirements that shape nursing home  		care. She feels that the biggest barrier to recruiting young physicians to  		nursing home care is the negative stigma associated with working in nursing  		homes. </p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: The medical director has been practicing  		in nursing home care for 28 years and has been at the current facility for 13  		years. He has an added certificate of qualification in geriatrics and is a  		certified medical director. This facility used to have a closed medical staff  		such that only specific physicians were allowed to follow patients in the home.  		The facility billed for the physician services, and physicians were paid on a  		salary basis. The facility discovered that by supporting this type of  		arrangement, they required a larger administrative staff to complete the  		physician billing. Additionally, hospital referrals decreased because the  		physicians were no longer in the hospital referring their patients to the  		facility. Now this arrangement has been dissolved and any physician can apply  		for privileges.</p>
<p>His main concern about the physician workforce in nursing homes is that  		because many physicians have five or fewer patients in nursing homes, he does  		not believe this low census provides an adequate skill set for provision of  		care in nursing homes. He believes that a "modified closed staff" model is the  		most effective physician practice model. In this model there is a core group of  		physicians who provide care to most of the patients in the facility; but if a  		physician wants to care for a specific patient, temporary privileges can be  		granted. After-hours phone calls would be directed to the core physicians to  		minimize confusion for the nurses. </p>
<p>The medical director stated that the number of lawsuits has begun to  		increase here and, with this increase, malpractice insurance premiums have  		risen. Malpractice premiums are a barrier to maintaining a physician workforce  		in nursing homes because malpractice insurance is $8,000 to $13,000 higher per  		year for physicians who choose to take care of nursing home patients compared  		to those who do not.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker in this facility  		preferred having salaried physicians who were full-time practitioners in the  		facility. She was disappointed when the facility converted from a closed  		physician staff to an open staff model. While she recognizes that the current  		arrangement of a physician on site every day is unique and valuable, she  		reported that since changing the practice model, physicians seem rushed and not  		as available to residents and staff for ad hoc guidance regarding resident  		care. For example, when the physicians were salaried and more available, the  		social worker could informally ask the physician to step into a family  		conference to answer some medical questions for the family. She feels that,  		ultimately, it is this type of interaction that enhances the perception of  		quality of care for family and residents. However, the physicians are too busy  		now during their time in the facility to participate in this type of informal  		interaction.</p>
<p>She has observed a number of physician practice models, but she feels a  		closed staff model is the most effective model because communication is  		seamless between the nursing home staff and the physicians. In the current  		system she has heard the patients comment that the doctor never saw them during  		their nursing home stays. She reported that often the physicians do not see the  		patients and instead write orders and deliver care directly through the nurses.  		They also rarely meet with families, which leaves the families without contact  		information or knowledge. She noted that when doctors refuse to deliver care in  		the nursing home they explain that the reimbursement is too low and the  		paperwork too voluminous to make it worth their time.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician</i></b>: The physician participating in the stakeholder  		discussions was involved with the facility as a salaried physician, but now in  		private practice and bills Medicare Part B visits to nursing home residents. He  		felt the salaried model provided time to deliver high quality care and noted  		that he is not able to devote as much time to the facility now that he is an  		independent physician billing separately. He described the nursing home  		environment in general as very different from any other care environment due to  		the regulatory requirements. He stated that any physician practicing in a  		nursing home needs to know the house rules before being allowed to  		participate. By house rules, he was referring to regulations  		limiting the use of chemical and physical restraints, physician visitation  		requirements, change of condition notification requirements, and a host of  		other requirements regarding care delivery in nursing homes. He indicated that  		the regulations are important to understand if one is to practice successfully  		in the nursing home environment. He feels the ideal model would be a capitated  		model in which physicians are salaried by a facility, but bear some financial  		risk and, therefore, a commitment to providing high quality, cost-effective  		care along with all the other staff members. </p>
<p><b><i>Assistant Director of Nursing</i></b>: The assistant director of  		nursing has worked in nursing home care and at this facility for 3.5 years. She  		reported that annual nursing staff turnover is only 30% in this facility  		compared to 80%-100%, according to national data. She indicated that the  		facility has developed partnerships with a local nursing consortium to educate  		students entering the health professions with hopes they will remain in the  		community to deliver care. She reported that several grants have facilitated  		the teaching relationship, including one that involves the use of telemedicine.  		One result of having physicians in the facility every day is the high volume of  		orders which creates additional work for the nursing staff to enter the orders  		in the medical record and ensure that orders are carried out. By virtue of  		being in the facility daily and speaking with nurses and residents about acute  		issues, more orders are written than in facilities where the physicians are  		there only a few hours each month and aware of fewer concerns. She is very  		pleased with the daily presence of the physicians and believes that this  		results in a higher standard of care.</p>
<h3>FACILITY 3 -- THE MANAGED CARE MODEL</h3>
<p>Facility 3 was selected to represent physician practice models involving  		managed care. The facility has a contract with the large managed care group,  		Kaiser, and a high penetration of Kaiser patients in the facility. The facility  		has 162 beds and has 20 Kaiser and 8 private physicians who see patients in the  		facility. Both the Kaiser and private physicians care for residents receiving  		skilled (Medicare) and custodial care. In addition, nurse practitioners, who  		are employed by Kaiser, are very involved in patient care. The facility has  		both skilled and custodial care beds, and the skilled unit has a rapid turnover  		of residents with numerous admissions and discharges every day. In this  		facility, discussions were held with the administrator, director of nursing,  		medical director, physician and staff development coordinator.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: The administrator felt the  		Kaiser physicians pay more attention to patients than the non-Kaiser  		physicians, and that the approach of pairing physicians with nurse  		practitioners was highly beneficial to both patients and the facility. He was  		extremely critical of how the regulatory and legal environments in nursing  		homes impede the provision of good physician care. For example, he described  		the intense regulatory environment as one that consumes the majority of his  		employees time with paperwork rather than allowing them to provide care  		to residents. He believed the requirement that nurses call physicians for even  		minor occurrences results in frustration for both the nurses and physicians. He  		felt these calls ultimately lead to high nursing staff turnover because nurses  		fear reaching an intolerant physician for another call about an inconsequential  		event, such as a skin abrasion.</p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: The director of nursing at this  		facility compared the performance of the Kaiser physicians to the non-Kaiser  		physicians. She preferred the Kaiser model for several reasons: the physicians  		and nurse practitioners are on-site more often and more involved with patient  		care, leading to better care; are always available; they are assigned to Kaiser  		patients specifically and tend to stay with this nursing home for several  		years, allowing them to build trust with the nursing home staff; and, finally,  		they have a comprehensive admissions process that improves communication about  		medical conditions to the nursing staff at the time of transition into the  		nursing home and enhances rapport with families. The Kaiser model combines  		physical presence in the nursing home and an organized admissions process, two  		features that resulted in better care delivery (e.g., availability in the event  		of a condition change or emergency, and more complete medical information to  		guide care) by the Kaiser physicians in contrast to the care provided by the  		non-Kaiser physicians. She also has observed lower hospitalization rates for  		patients with the Kaiser physicians; however, she has noticed that  		hospitalizations have been increasing for patients treated by both Kaiser and  		non-Kaiser physicians because of malpractice concerns and more frequent  		hospitalization requests from family members. She reported that when patients  		and families seek to change doctors, they usually do so because they are  		displeased with the timeliness of the physician visits. She has never had a  		Kaiser patient request another physician, but she has seen requests from  		patients with non-Kaiser doctors request a new physician.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker reported that there is a  		high penetration of Kaiser physicians at this facility, about two to every one  		non-Kaiser physician for the 162 patients. The social worker has frequent  		in-person interactions with the Kaiser physicians who are in the facility  		almost every day. However, the non-Kaiser physicians generally are too busy to  		meet with social workers so interaction with the non-Kaiser physicians is  		primarily by telephone. She reports that the majority of residents and families  		are happy with their physicians and with the responsiveness to their concerns.  		Those who are not satisfied with their physician usually are those seen by  		non-Kaiser physicians and generally attribute their dissatisfaction to concerns  		about availability. This concern often is raised by patients who are not  		enrolled in Kaiser and who observe the Kaiser physicians in the facility daily,  		but who do not see their own physician in the facility as often.</p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: The medical director is a certified  		medical director. He spends approximately 18 hours per week providing direct  		patient care in nursing homes, and the remainder of time in his role as medical  		director for five different facilities. He cares for 150 patients at a total of  		seven facilities. In five of the seven facilities, he serves as medical  		director. He does not employ physician extenders. He is concerned that finding  		physicians to care for residents will become a problem in the future, but they  		currently "get by" with a stable number of physicians. During monthly meetings  		with the staff, the medical director determines if physicians are in compliance  		with regulations regarding required physician visits, comprehensive annual  		assessments, signing of all orders, and use of psychotropic medications. In  		situations where physicians are not in compliance, the Medical Director reviews  		the case and contacts the physician directly. The Medical Director routinely  		accepts patients of physicians who do not want to continue following their  		patients from the outpatient setting into the nursing home, accounting for  		60%-80% of all his patient referrals. He believes that the other physicians and  		their mid-level practitioners do not communicate as regularly with the nursing  		home staff. He attributed poor communication between the nursing home staff and  		the other physicians to the low priority doctors give to nursing homes in  		comparison to the attention paid to their office and hospital-based practices.  		He explained that the nursing home is simply not the main priority for  		physicians with outpatient and hospital-based practices because these patients  		generally are not as ill as hospitalized patients and are not built into their  		schedules like clinic patients.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician</i></b>: The physician for the managed care model is  		board-certified in internal medicine with a certification of added  		qualifications in geriatric medicine. She is employed by Kaiser and currently  		cares for 150 skilled and custodial level nursing home patients in seven  		facilities, focusing exclusively on providing geriatric and hospice care. About  		75% of her work is direct patient care with geriatric patients and  		approximately 25% is direct patient care providing home hospice. Her managed  		care practice model includes eight physicians and six mid-level practitioners  		who care for 700-800 skilled and custodial patients residing in 45-50 different  		facilities.</p>
<p>She described Kaiser as providing a unique and intensive level of care  		to its skilled nursing home patients. Skilled patients are seen weekly, and  		custodial care patients are seen monthly for the first 90 days and every 60  		days thereafter, sooner if there is a change in condition. A physician may have  		anywhere from 20 to 30 skilled patients in a single facility. The high-density  		practice allows her to spend considerable time in a single facility. She  		follows patients at seven facilities, although only one of these facilities  		provides skilled care. She is typically at the skilled care facility three  		times a week and sees each patient with her nurse practitioner. Additionally,  		she meets weekly with nursing home staff, the Kaiser medical staff (i.e., the  		Kaiser physicians and mid-level practitioners) and the rehabilitation staff at  		the other six nursing homes. The weekly, intensive physician follow-up is, she  		believes, what distinguishes the Kaiser model from other community physician  		practices. Concentrating the skilled patients in fewer facilities also allows  		for provision of high quality care to frail, elderly patients.</p>
<p>This physician indicated that collaboration with nurse practitioners and  		physician assistants is essential in allowing the Kaiser physicians to care for  		large practices. She noted that there are many community physicians who are  		very good and are extremely attentive to their patients; however, there are an  		equal number who spend 10 minutes writing in the chart and waving to the  		patient before leaving the nursing home. She feels it is too risky for patients  		to leave hospitals, where they require daily visits, to go to a nursing home  		and receive only monthly visits. She is a proponent of using geriatric  		fellowship training as the basis for learning how to provide nursing home  		care.</p>
<p>While she did not perceive an inadequate supply of physicians who see  		nursing home patients, she did have concerns about the quality of the care  		provided by physicians who spend minimal time in nursing homes and who are not  		trained in the care of nursing home patients. When physicians are not present  		in nursing facilities, communications between physicians and nursing home staff  		often are handled by telephone. This physician observed that the reliability of  		the nursing staff assessments impact the medical care provided. If assessments  		are inaccurate and the physician is generally not present in the facility, it  		can be very difficult to make accurate and appropriate recommendations.</p>
<p>To be cost-effective, she believed she needed to see a minimum of 10  		patients per facility. However, as a salaried physician, she receives the same  		compensation regardless of the daily fluctuations in her patient volume. She  		felt flexibility of a physician's schedule is critical in caring for a nursing  		home population because he/she can alter the amount of time spent with a  		patient to meet their needs rather than simply responding to the pressure of a  		waiting room filled with patients.</p>
<p><b><i>Staff Development Coordinator</i></b>: The staff development  		coordinator is a nurse, responsible for identifying how to improve nursing care  		to residents and coordinating the educational effort necessary to improve care.  		She reported that Kaiser physicians were available daily. She described that  		most other physicians at the facility only have a few patients, their visits  		are less frequent, and the timing of their visits much less predictable. She  		believes that the most pressing issues related to physician practice models are  		the frequency of visits to patients. She believes that physicians should visit  		more frequently than monthly and provide more compassionate care.</p>
<h3>FACILITY 4 -- LIMITED PHYSICIAN POOL MODEL</h3>
<p>Discussions were held in Facility 4 with six staff members of a 130-bed  		facility located in North Carolina where the medical director and one other  		physician provide care for 90% of the residents. This facility was selected to  		represent facilities in which there are a very limited number of physicians  		providing all of the physician care in the facility. This facility is in close  		proximity to a university and serves as a training site for medical students  		and geriatric fellows. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: The administrator in Facility  		4 has been at the current facility for three years and in nursing home care for  		over five years. She valued the collegiality in the facility, the expertise of  		geriatricians, and the commitment of the medical director who specialized in  		geriatrics. She felt geriatricians made a big difference in the  		quality of care and were able to see the bigger picture, which  		meant they were interested in educating nursing home staff and medical students  		about geriatric syndromes (i.e., urinary incontinence, pressure ulcers, falls)  		and facility-level quality improvement. Resident care was described as truly a  		team effort with mutual respect among the staff. The university affiliation  		allows for a focus on research and quality of care, which she believed,  		enhanced quality improvement efforts due to constant oversight of these  		efforts. This facility has on-site physician time every day, which is  		complemented by two nurse practitioners employed by the facility.</p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: The director of nursing has been at  		the current facility for three-and-a-half years and in nursing home care for 15  		years. She reported that with only two physicians, almost all patients change  		their primary attending to one of the nursing home physicians upon admission.  		The limited number of physicians allows the physicians to be on-site frequently  		and highly involved in patient care, two characteristics she felt were  		indicative of good physician practice. Having physicians on-site also has  		allowed the facility to handle more medical problems without resorting to  		hospitalization. She emphasized the need to build a relationship between the  		facility and the physicians. She believes that malpractice concerns affect the  		way physicians practice in nursing homes, and that increasing premiums are  		driving physicians away from the field of nursing home medicine.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker indicated that she spent  		the majority of her time addressing family and patient concerns as well as  		completing required documentation/paperwork. The social worker is assigned to  		specific floors and collaborates with physicians mostly on discharge plans and  		family concerns. She reported that physicians are in the facility once a week,  		while the nurse practitioners are there daily. She said she interacted more  		with nurse practitioners because they are in the facility more often than  		physicians, and, for that reason, are more accessible.</p>
<p>The social worker was pleased with physician response time to phone  		calls and e-mails, which she used to communicate with the physicians regarding  		non-urgent matters. She reported that it is difficult to set up meetings with  		physicians, so she only contacts them for meetings if there is a specific  		medical issue during care planning that needs to be addressed with the family.  		Families and patients generally are satisfied with the care they receive;  		however, some expect to be seen by their physician more often. One physician  		gives families her e-mail address and pager number so they can contact her  		directly. The social worker reported that the biggest concern from families is  		getting to meet with and speak to the physicians when they are visiting their  		loved ones in the facility.</p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: The medical director spends 10% of her  		time providing medical care for 50 nursing home patients (approximately four  		hours per week), and the balance of her time is spent caring for clinic  		patients and teaching at a local university. She is a geriatrician and a strong  		believer in the need for physicians to have specialized training in long-term  		care. She believes the physicians must understand the environment of long-term  		care in order to provide care there. She reported that malpractice issues are  		impacting physicians' willingness to practice in nursing homes. Physicians with  		community-based practices rarely are willing to come into the facility so the  		patients are encouraged upon admission to switch to the physicians who provide  		care regularly in the facility. </p>
<p>She works closely with the nurse practitioner employed by the facility  		and enjoys a positive relationship with the nurses who tend to know the  		patients very well. She felt she is part of a team. She feels long-term care  		should be incorporated more explicitly into residency and medical school  		training. She believes that a main barrier to achieving good care in a nursing  		home is appropriate reimbursement. She also stated that all medical directors  		should be required to obtain American Medical Directors Association  		certification in medical directorship. Her motivation for staying in long-term  		care is the strong relationship she develops with patients and the strong sense  		of being part of a team. The lack of office overhead also is an appealing  		feature of her long-term care practice.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician</i></b>: The Medical Director and one other physician  		take care of nearly all of the residents in this facility. The physician was  		contacted as the representative physician for this facility. The physician has  		a certificate of added qualification in geriatrics and works in partnership  		with the two nurse practitioners in the facility. She also participates in the  		education of geriatric fellows. She has observed various physician practice  		models in the community. She reported that physicians associated with academic  		medical centers are being contracted to provide medical directorship and  		clinical care, while community-based physicians are either relinquishing care  		of their nursing home patients or using mid-level practitioners to assist in  		this care. Other physicians follow their primary care practice patients into  		the nursing home; however, this model is being replaced by physicians who are  		employed by groups that only see nursing home patients. She believed that this  		new practice model is in response to the increasing acuity of nursing home  		patients and the need for a practitioner who is in the facility or who can go  		to the facility to respond to patients who experience acute clinical  		decline.</p>
<p>She reported that physicians who do not understand the pressures faced  		by nursing homes staff tend to become hostile with the nurses. She believes the  		ideal practice model is one where the majority of patients in a facility are  		cared for by a few physicians who are in the facility regularly and know how to  		communicate effectively with staff. She cited the following barriers to  		maintaining physicians who are willing to provide care in nursing homes: (1)  		concerns about lawsuits; (2) low nurse to patient staffing ratios; (3) nursing  		staff turnover; and (4) unrealistic expectations of family regarding the  		capabilities of nursing homes which leads to disgruntled families and  		physicians who become frustrated practicing in the nursing home  		environment.</p>
<p><b><i>Nurse Practitioner</i></b>: The two mid-level practitioners at  		this facility alternate with the physician during the 30 and 60-day visits  		required by Medicare. The nurse practitioner reported that one facility  		physician sees patients there once a week for four hours. The nurse  		practitioner stated that mid-level practitioners supplement physician care by  		improving patient satisfaction and relationships with family members, and by  		providing on-site care for acutely ill residents. Mid-level practitioners are  		contract/salaried employees of the nursing facility. The facility bills  		Medicare Part B for their services and receives the money that goes towards  		their salaries. This mid-level practitioner cares for 12-15 patients daily.</p>
<p>She reported that two physicians at this facility generally see patients  		here every other week and are affiliated with the university. This stakeholder  		felt that this model works well and that the physicians are very involved in  		quality review meetings and available for family meetings. She indicated that  		the predictability of physician visits was one of the strongest assets of this  		model. The nurse practitioner cited liability concerns as potentially affecting  		the way the physicians and mid-level practitioners practice at this facility in  		that documentation is far more detailed and more tests are ordered to ensure  		accuracy. There also is likely increased communication with the physicians so  		that all parties involved are current on condition changes and status of the  		residents.</p>
<p>The nurse practitioner reported that this facility currently is working  		on decreasing hospitalization rates through increased training of nurses on the  		use of intravenous therapy. While the supply of nurse practitioners in this  		region is increasing, those who want to work in nursing homes are not.  		Unfortunately, she also felt that many nurses within this nursing facility lean  		on the nurse practitioners to help with their duties, and she felt she could  		spend more time with patients if she werent helping the nurses perform  		their tasks. She indicated that better training for nursing staff would allow  		more highly trained professionals to focus on complex medical management rather  		than on assisting with routine nursing duties.</p>
<h3>FACILITY 5 -- THE LITIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT</h3>
<p>A Florida facility was selected because physician practitioners in the  		state are currently facing a rapid increase in the number of lawsuits related  		to nursing home care. Discussions were completed for a nursing home  		administrator, a medical director, a physician and two nurse practitioners.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: The administrator has been an  		administrator for five years at this facility. Given the litigious environment  		in Florida, it might be expected that facilities would have difficulty in  		recruiting physicians but that was not the case, according to this  		administrator.</p>
<p>Although her facility has a contract with a managed care organization,  		the administrator did not notice any practice differences between the managed  		care physicians and the other attending physicians. She reported that patients  		with medical problems almost always are hospitalized when physicians are  		contacted by nursing staff. She attributed this to either concern about  		malpractice or simply physician convenience of seeing patients at the hospital  		rather than at the nursing home where it is difficult to obtain laboratory and  		radiologic studies in a timely manner from the consulting ancillary service  		providers.</p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: This medical director has been  		practicing in nursing homes for 18 years and has been a certified medical  		director for 10 years. He serves as the medical director in four homes. He  		cares for 1,000 nursing home residents in 10 nursing homes and is in practice  		with four physicians, seven nurse practitioners and two podiatrists.  		Approximately 90% of his patients are in nursing homes.</p>
<p>He believes the optimal nursing home practice model is an attending  		physician paired with one or more mid-level practitioners. He is in the nursing  		home three days per week. The facilities he prefers to work in are those with a  		stable staff and where the director of nursing and administrator have been  		there for at least two years. Constant turnover is a tremendous barrier to  		providing quality physician care.</p>
<p>He has observed facilities asking physicians who specialize in hospital  		care with no qualifications in geriatrics to serve as medical directors simply  		because they can bring in business from the hospital. In his experience these  		physicians tend to not call back or attend meetings but the nursing facility  		corporate representatives are pleased because the physician delivers admissions  		to the facility. In addition, this medical director believed that a facility  		can be served best when the medical director has 50% or greater of the patients  		in a facility. He believed that more physicians often translate into worse care  		because of the potential for communication breakdowns with each additional  		practitioner. Time is involved with communicating to multiple physicians with  		different contact information and styles. For example, if a facility only has  		two or three doctors, the nurses have ready access to the telephone, pager and  		fax numbers for each doctor and know which type of communication method to use  		for different types of information (e.g., a routine report of a skin tear as  		opposed to calling a pager used for emergencies). All of the labs in a given  		day will be faxed to a maximum of three different numbers. This is in contrast  		to a facility where there are 20 practitioners, all with different contact  		information, where a desire to receive information in different formats (i.e.,  		fax versus phone report), and the potential for ineffective communication  		increases with each additional practitioner. </p>
<p>He explained that five years ago many malpractice insurance companies  		discontinued provision of coverage for physicians working in nursing homes. The  		state then began issuing malpractice insurance to these physicians. For  		physicians who only had a few nursing home patients, this signaled their exits  		from long-term care. He feels physicians who have additional qualifications in  		the care of nursing home patients, either by the volume of patients they see  		and/or by training, should be offered lower malpractice rates. He also believes  		that the public should engage in a dialog regarding the ethical dilemmas faced  		by nursing homes when providing care to persons at the end of life and that  		that this effort may reduce lawsuits when events such as weight loss and  		pressure ulcers occur at the end of life.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician</i></b>: The physician expressed difficulty finding  		affordable malpractice insurance in Florida before the state provided  		insurance. He explained that the risk of being sued poses one of the major  		barriers to providing nursing home care. He also reported ordering more tests,  		being more rigorous with documentation and hospitalizing patients more often  		due to the malpractice environment in his state. The fear of being sued is  		pervasive and diminishes the advantages and rewards of a nursing home practice,  		which he perceives as managing complex medical conditions and developing  		long-term relationships with patients and their families. The litigious  		environment is having an adverse impact on the states supply of  		physicians willing to go to nursing homes. He stated that physicians are afraid  		of being sued, and he shared this concern.</p>
<p>He believes that poor care can be an outcome of physicians treating less  		than five patients in a facility and reported that he usually follows about 10  		patients in a given facility. Poor care is characterized by both ineffective  		communication between the facility and the physician (i.e., failure to return  		phone calls) and a tendency to hospitalize residents rather than assess them in  		the facility. Convenient location and adequate staffing affected his decision  		concerning where to practice. To train physicians, he thought a month-long  		rotation in a nursing home would be helpful, succeeded by a year of following a  		panel of patients at various nursing homes.</p>
<p><b><i>Nurse Practitioner 1</i></b>: Mid-level practitioners at this  		facility are employed directly by the physicians to supplement physician care.  		This nurse practitioner sees 17-20 patients per day, and the majority of her  		time is spent on direct patient care. Her biggest concern about the delivery of  		physician care in nursing homes is the infrequency of physician visits. She  		feels that having a physician in the facility daily is necessary to address  		unexpected issues that arise. This stakeholder did not interact with physicians  		at the facility other than the physician by whom she is employed. However, she  		felt those physicians who use mid-level practitioners catch medical issues  		earlier and decrease the rate of hospitalizations. </p>
<p>She also reported that anxieties about liability concern physicians  		practicing in this facility. She indicated that reputable physicians have given  		up their nursing home practices because of liability issues. Because of this,  		she indicated that she is more aggressive in treating patients. She recommends  		hospitalization more often, for example, and uses more aggressive treatments  		than she would in the absence of these concerns.</p>
<p><b><i>Nurse Practitioner 2</i></b>: This nurse practitioner has  		specialized training in geriatric and hospice care. She spends approximately  		50% of her time in the care of nursing home residents and sees 6-10 nursing  		home patients per day. She reported a substantial change in the  		physicians role in nursing homes during the past 10 years from one of  		occasional oversight of patients with straightforward, chronic, stable medical  		conditions to one of active management of patients with complex, acute and  		chronic, often unstable conditions. There is increasing recognition by nursing  		home practitioners that nursing home residents are complicated medically and  		need physician oversight.</p>
<p>She has observed two physician models in the area. One consists of the  		dispersed model where a physician has a number of patients scattered in various  		facilities in town. The other model involves physicians who do not have an  		office and who spend 100% of their practices in long-term care. Many of these  		full-time, long-term care practitioners also have mid-level practitioners  		working with them. She felt that too much responsibility is placed on the  		mid-level practitioners with the physician only making brief visits that often  		do not even involve a patient examination. S he attributed the frequent lack of  		an examination to physician discomfort with visits outside of a typical  		office-based examining room. She explained that many physicians do not know how  		to conduct the nursing home patient examination because they are not taught in  		medical school how to perform home visits. She recommended adding an  		examination room in the facility and actually having the resident go to this  		room for their visits. She has observed this model in nursing homes and noted  		an improvement in the quality of the patient-doctor encounter. </p>
<p>Litigation is of great concern to her and she describes it as, "coloring  		every single thing we do." She attributed the paucity of young doctors entering  		the field of nursing home care to fear of litigation and questioned why any  		physician continues practicing in the nursing home setting given the litigious  		environment. </p>
<h3>FACILITY 6 -- HIGH PENETRATION OF EVERCARE MODEL</h3>
<p>This facility in Minnesota was selected based on the high penetration of  		a novel capitated care delivery model. The selected facility is a  		Catholic-based nursing facility with 300 beds and located in a suburban  		location. An administrator, director of nursing, social worker, medical  		director, physician, and registered nurse participated in stakeholder  		discussions.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: Almost one-third of the  		residents in this facility were enrolled in the Evercare capitated care model  		for persons eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. The presence of Evercare  		nurse practitioners has become an incentive for the physicians to treat  		patients in the facility because they trust the nurse practitioners  		assessment skills and ability to respond quickly to an acute clinical decline.  		The administrator reported a recent increase in physician recruitment noting  		that physicians are specializing in and even focusing their entire practice on  		nursing home patients.</p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: This facility has a relationship with  		one large geriatric group that cares for the majority of its patients. There  		are also a large number of community physicians who follow a very small number  		of their own patients in the nursing home. She was very pleased with the  		geriatric group, but less so with the community physicians. The geriatric group  		is on-site and more timely with follow-up visits. She reported that when  		patients change physicians, they usually do so at the urging of the social  		worker based on physician non-compliance with regulatory visits. She attributed  		the success of Evercare in this facility to the presence of nurse practitioners  		rather than any differences in the physician care.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker interacts with physicians  		prior to admission of a new resident by verifying that the primary physician  		will follow the resident at the facility. Six physicians see patients in the  		facility, and three of the six are described as having a frequent presence.  		Physicians are in the facility about one-to-two times per month, depending on  		caseloads. The social worker felt that the best physician practice models are  		those where the physician works closely with a mid-level practitioner because  		the mid-level practitioners are there more regularly (i.e., 2-3 days per week)  		and can provide more care than the physician who is on-site infrequently. She  		noted that the physicians with a geriatric focus tend to make themselves more  		available for meetings. She also indicated that the Evercare physicians have a  		much more noticeable presence in the facility, and families tend to expect this  		of the other, non-Evercare physicians.</p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: The medical director is contracted for  		four hours of consultative services per week. There are 3050 physicians  		who provide medical services to residents in this facility, although there are  		two medical groups who cover the majority of patients. </p>
<p>He believes the supply of physicians is adequate to provide care to  		nursing home patients and thought that the supply, in fact may be slowly  		increasing because organizations like Evercare seem to have success with  		physician recruitment efforts. He believed that Evercare is the ideal physician  		practice model for nursing homes and cited Evercares greatest asset as  		the integration of nurse practitioners. Evercares nurse practitioners  		take phone calls and respond to routine order clarifications, tasks that are  		frustrating to physicians. He believed that physicians who have only a few  		patients in nursing homes and dont understand nursing homes do not  		provide high quality care. He observed that physicians who provide medical  		services to at least 50% of the patients in a facility produce better care in  		terms of communication and provision of services for urgent care needs.</p>
<p>He stated that poor reimbursement for physicians providing nursing home  		care forces physicians to either have large nursing home patient volumes or  		abandon their nursing home practices. To make it worth the physicians  		time, he estimated that a physician should have at least 10 patients in one  		home.</p>
<p>He believes the most important element in training physicians to care  		for nursing home patients is hands-on training where a physician-in-training is  		paired with a nursing home physician. He noted that this training also should  		emphasize end-of-life care because this is an important issue faced by nursing  		home physicians every day.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician</i></b>: Until two years ago, the physician in Facility  		6 was providing care to nursing home patients as a member of a 50-physician,  		multispecialty clinic. He was one of 20 primary care physicians spending a  		half-day a month following patients in various nursing homes. Because the  		nursing home was seen as a burden for most of the physicians in the group, he  		offered to do almost all of the nursing home work for the group. He and one  		other geriatrician have become the main practitioners of the clinics  		services to nursing home patients. They see about 300 patients in 10 different  		nursing homes, with the majority residing in just two facilities, and they  		continue to follow the patients if they are hospitalized.</p>
<p>He described the most important part of his practice as meeting with all  		patients and their families when patients are first admitted to the facility  		for in-depth discussions regarding expectations and care goals. He was adamant  		that physicians working with nursing home patients need to be trained to look  		at the overall picture and make goals accordingly. He was critical of physician  		practice models that emphasize "shift work" where the physician is only  		available for a defined period of time each day and then transfers care to an  		on-call physician who may or may not know the patients well. He believes that  		physicians are exposed first to nursing home care as an after-thought or an  		"add on" to their already busy practices rather than as an important component  		of their practices. He believes that a mandatory medical student rotation with  		physicians who enjoy providing care in nursing homes may spark interest earlier  		for physicians and cause them to seek rather than settle for nursing home  		patients. </p>
<p>He added that Evercare changed the way nursing home care was provided in  		his community and offered a major improvement by utilizing nurse practitioners.  		He would like to see a group of physicians organized to provide care to nursing  		home residents and believes using a capitated system places financial risk on  		the practitioner, resulting in more conscientious care.</p>
<p><b><i>Registered Nurse</i></b>: This nurse is certified in geriatrics  		and is employed directly by the facility. She does not perform direct patient  		care, but rather manages staff and works directly with physicians. This  		facility has mid-level practitioners who are employed directly by the medical  		group practices, not the physicians or the facility. Mid-level practitioners  		are the first line of contact. Some mid-level practitioners are there as often  		as four days a week, some weekly, some twice a month, and some once a  		month.</p>
<p>She did not have extensive knowledge of other practice models in the  		community, but she felt that the model she works in is very efficient. She  		indicated that the Evercare system works extremely well with this frail,  		elderly population and during the past 10 years, has decreased hospitalization  		rates. She indicated that nursing staff have an excellent relationship with the  		physicians and, as a consequence, physician turnover at this facility is very  		low and generally only occurs when a physician retires. Liability was not  		indicated as a primary concern for physicians or staff.</p>
<h3>FACILITY 7 -- THE CLOSED PHYSICIAN PRACTICE MODEL</h3>
<p>This facility, located in New York, was selected to investigate a closed  		physician practice model where the physicians are employed by the facility and  		only the six physicians on staff are permitted to care for patients there. All  		of the six physicians are geriatricians and the facility serves as a training  		site for geriatric fellows. There are 15 units with 40 beds each. Discussions  		were completed with the nursing home administrator, medical director, social  		worker, director of nursing and nurse manager. Discussions were not held with a  		physician, other than the medical director.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: The administrator stated that  		the facility is blessed with all geriatricians who bring a  		commitment to aging and medical issues specific to geriatrics. The  		administrator felt that, ultimately, good care depends on the commitment of the  		individual physicians and how responsive they are to their patients. He stated  		that patients were very rarely dissatisfied with the practice model, and he  		could not recall a patient requesting another physician. The physicians each  		spend approximately 40 hours per week in the facility, and the staff is very  		stable with a very low turnover of physicians. </p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: The director of nursing is an  		advocate of the closed model practice. She noted that requests to change  		physicians are very rare and, when they do occur generally are not due to  		concerns about care but rather differences in personality types. Her biggest  		concern about the closed, teaching practice model was that because it is the  		site for teaching, the physicians-in-training tend to utilize more resources --  		as if the patients were in an acute hospital. This is a concern because it  		increases the cost of care. She also added that concerns about liability lead  		to high utilization of laboratory testing.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker has a small caseload of  		about 10 patients. The role of this social worker is to facilitate  		communication between family and staff, and to be involved with various  		facility committees. The social worker is very involved with physicians and  		mid-level practitioners in the facility and often coordinates meetings to  		discuss patient issues or concerns. The social worker felt that it was easy to  		communicate with attending physicians regarding patient issues. All physicians  		are on staff so there is little to no concern about being able to contact a  		physician. The social worker felt that physicians have too many patients, but  		she did not feel that this caseload affects patient care. Patients and families  		are very satisfied with accessibility of physicians and extenders.</p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: The medical director, who is fellowship  		trained in geriatrics, spends 10 hours per week caring for approximately 120  		patients and 8-10 hours per week in the medical director role. He reported that  		litigation is a concern because it increases testing and interventions. He  		reported feeling pressure to hospitalize patients because of concerns about  		malpractice. The facility has had difficulty finding coverage for the medical  		director role. Additionally, it has been difficult to find physicians, but now  		there are enough physicians because of the facility's connection to the  		geriatric training fellowship program.</p>
<p>The medical director believed a closed system is optimal, resulting in  		high quality delivery of care. He also believed that quality in the facility  		improves when a nursing home functions as a training site for medical residents  		and nurse practitioners. He estimated that the necessary volume to generate  		income in a closed system is 200-300 patients per physician/nurse practitioner  		team. In general, he noted that physicians do not understand reimbursement in  		nursing homes and that if they take the time to learn and bill appropriately  		Medicare reimbursement is adequate.</p>
<p><b><i>Nurse Manager</i></b>: The nurse manager listed two positive  		aspects of this facilitys closed practice model: (1) the physicians are  		very current on geriatric practices, and (2) there is a physician whose primary  		responsibility is reducing unnecessary hospital admissions. In contrast, she  		indicated that the physicians-in-training are just learning to practice  		themselves and, occasionally, make decisions that reflect their inexperience in  		the elderly population such as ordering sedating medications that are  		associated with falls in the elderly. She felt the ideal model of practice  		would be to have one physician in the facility all day long, a  		Doctors Day. She indicated that she prefers knowing the  		physicians will be there for a few hours so she can communicate with them. She  		felt this also would improve communication with patients and families. The  		current mechanism for interacting with the physicians is through a  		communication logbook.</p>
<p>The nurse manager felt that liability concerns affect the way all of the  		physicians practice, particularly with regard to hospitalization. The doctors  		recognize how hazardous a hospitalization can be for a patient and they do  		everything they can to avoid it. However, they sometimes hospitalize simply to  		please a family member who they fear may become litigious. </p>
<h3>FACILITY 8 -- THE NURSING HOME SPECIALIST MODEL</h3>
<p>Facility 8, in Texas, was selected to represent a practice model where  		physicians perform nursing home care exclusively and are "specialists" in that  		area. The majority of patients in this 120-bed facility are seen by a group of  		physicians who practice exclusively in nursing homes. An administrator,  		director of nursing, social worker, medical director, physician and dietitian  		participated in the stakeholder discussions.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Home Administrator</i></b>: Three geriatricians who  		specialize in providing nursing home services provide most of the physician  		services in this facility. The American Medical Directors Association also  		certifies two of the three as nursing home medical directors. The nursing home  		administrator stated that she has noticed a difference in nursing home  		physicians who are geriatricians and other physicians and, therefore, she will  		grant privileges to practice in the facility to only physicians who are trained  		as geriatricians. She believes that geriatricians, in contrast to other  		physicians, are better able to address geriatric issues, such as falls,  		incontinence, failure to thrive, and agitated behaviors, such as those observed  		in demented residents. This facility has no difficulty in finding  		geriatric-trained physicians who are willing to practice in this facility  		because of the specialty nursing home group who only hires geriatric-trained  		physicians to work in the group. The administrator's major concern about  		physician practices in nursing homes is that physicians are forced to practice  		defensive medicine due to concerns about litigation. This results in ordering  		many tests and procedures that may be of very low yield instead of focusing on  		management of symptoms, which may impact the quality of the residents' lives,  		and be a much greater yield from a patient perspective.</p>
<p><b><i>Director of Nursing</i></b>: The director of nursing noted that  		physicians who specialize in caring for nursing home patients hospitalize at a  		much lower rate than the doctors who do not care exclusively for nursing home  		residents. She explained that nursing home residents rarely change physicians.  		However, on the rare occasion when they do request a different physician, it is  		because they are concerned that the frequency of physician visits is not  		sufficient.</p>
<p>To improve physician services in this nursing home, the director of  		nursing suggested more on-site time from either a nurse practitioner or a  		physician. She believes that communication between the physician and nursing  		home nurses also needs to improve because the nurses often do not know about  		the physician's impression of the patient or the issues that were addressed  		during their visits because of sparse verbal and written documentation.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Worker</i></b>: The social worker interacts daily with the  		nurse practitioners and physicians. Although it is sometimes difficult to set  		up meetings with physicians, the social worker does feel that the physicians  		are in the facility often enough, and she is not concerned that they see too  		many patients. She supported her argument that the specialist physician model  		is optimal by reporting that the majority of residents and families are  		satisfied with the medical care the residents are receiving. She did not  		express concerns about the frequency of physician visits or the quality of  		physician care.</p>
<p><b><i>Medical Director</i></b>: The medical director has training in  		internal medicine, geriatrics, palliative care and is an AMDA certified medical  		director. He is a part of a large group of 15 physicians who are each paired  		with one of three nurse practitioners. He is an exclusive nursing home doctor  		with no office patients.</p>
<p>The most influential factor on his practice is malpractice. His group  		practice employer has changed insurers at least three times in the past six  		years. He reported that the fear of litigation increases unnecessary testing  		and interventions. There is an adequate supply of physicians in his area. He  		sees approximately 15 patients per day, and estimates that to cover the costs  		of running his practice, he would need to see approximately seven patients per  		day. He considers the ideal training for nursing home specialists to be a  		geriatric fellowship and the American Medical Directors Association's  		certification in medical directorship program. He values nursing home practice  		because it allows practice freedom and he feels he has the ability to do more  		for patients than in other care settings.</p>
<p><b><i>Physician</i></b>: The physician was pleased with the nursing home  		specialist care model and has found that focusing only on the care of nursing  		home patients is a more efficient way to care for these patients. He felt that  		he can be more attuned to the specific characteristics of each facility and can  		streamline his practice by devoting one half-day each week to a specific home.  		He believed that using nursing home specialists to care for nursing home  		residents is an ideal practice model, and he has noticed the model growing in  		popularity in his community.</p>
<p><b><i>Dietician</i></b>: The dietitian at this facility indicated that  		the physicians spend an average of 16 hours per week in the facility, and that  		she has no concerns about physicians services in her facility. She felt  		that the specialist nursing home model works very well and is the only model of  		care she would work with. It is the ideal physician practice model because it  		ensures that the physicians are accessible, easy to communicate with,  		knowledgeable about geriatrics and specifically nursing home geriatrics, and  		accepting of all medical disciplines in nursing homes. They have daytime  		availability that is important for communication with interdisciplinary teams  		and with family members. She noted that the families frequently express their  		appreciation of physicians visiting during the daytime because the family  		members are often elderly and prefer to visit the facility during the daylight  		hours also.</p>
