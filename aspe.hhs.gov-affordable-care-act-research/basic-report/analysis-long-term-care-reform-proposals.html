<h4>What is the Prospect for Long-Term Reform?</h4>
<p>Though not as precipitous perhaps as the crises of the uninsured and  		health care costs, the problem of long-term care looms on the nation's horizon.  		We are an aging population, and long-term care will comprise an ever-increasing  		percentage of our nation's expenditures for health care. We do not have an  		adequate system for financing the services that people need, and many elderly  		live in fear that chronic illness will devastate them financially, leave them  		dependent on their children or welfare, and limit their ability to live where  		and how they want at the end of their lives. Too often, these fears become  		reality. While long-term care reform may not be <i>imminent</i>, it is probably  		fair to say that the current political climate implicitly recognizes that  		long-term care reform will follow soon on the heels of reform of our acute  		health care system. This timetable could change, however, if long-term care  		reform becomes a "wild card" in the crafting of a political consensus around  		acute health care reform.</p>
<p>As the long-term care debate moves forward, we certainly are not lacking  		for ideas. Numerous proposals for reforming both public and private financing  		systems have been laid on the table. Some of these ideas have been incorporated  		into legislative proposals by Congress, although, as yet, there has been no  		serious effort to enact any of these proposals into law.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to heed the advice of our national baseball  		sage and take a serious look at where these various long-term care reform  		proposals may take us, before we end up somewhere where we don't want to be. It  		does not advocate any one particular route. The purpose of the paper is rather  		to describe the diverse strategies that have been proposed, and to present a  		balanced discussion of the points that have been made in support of, and in  		opposition to, each proposal. Like controversial calls on the baseball diamond,  		what we believe is "balanced" may not be perceived to be so by those who  		advocate a particular proposal, but so be it. Our goal is to inform the  		long-term care debate, so that the decisions we make as a nation about  		long-term care policy are ones that we will look back upon with vindication,  		not regret.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note1">1</a></font></p>
<h4>What's Wrong With The Current System?</h4>
<p>Before describing long-term care reform strategies, we should first  		examine the strengths and weaknesses of our current system. One characteristic  		of the existing system that must be kept in mind is that most long-term care  		provided in the United States is informal (unpaid) care. In 1989, there were  		about 2.1 million disabled elderly persons living in the community receiving  		active help in basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from other people.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note2">2</a></font> Almost two-thirds of these individuals  		receive help from informal caregivers only.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note3">3</a></font> Only about one in twenty persons in the community  		receive no informal care, and rely solely on formal sources of assistance. Many  		more elderly receive informal help in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living  		(IADLs) in tasks such as meal preparation, laundry, grocery shopping, and money  		management. So although, in 1992, we as a country will spend about $60 billion  		dollars for formal long-term care services for the elderly through public and  		private sources,<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note4">4</a></font> the value of long  		-term care provided by family and friends exceeds this amount by far.</p>
<p>Do we rely too heavily on family caregivers? Are families  		unduly-stressed by the burdens of informal care? Should more public assistance  		be made available to reduce these burdens? These questions are fundamental in  		assessing the merits of long-term care proposals, because many proposals  		explicitly intend to increase the role of formal providers, so that the burden  		on informal caregivers may be lessened.</p>
<p>A system that relies primarily on unpaid, rather than paid, help has  		some significant advantages. One obvious strength is the commitment of family  		caregivers. There is no evidence that the dependent elderly are being abandoned  		by their families, despite the growing mobility of our society and the  		increased labor force participation of women. Informal care is more flexible,  		usually more caring, and more reciprocal. The "intangible' benefits of informal  		caregiving within families are self-evident, but difficult to measure.  		Regardless of what public long-term care policy we end up with, the care of  		disabled elderly people by their families will always be a foundation of our  		long-term care system.</p>
<p>The centrality of informal care is a key distinction between our  		long-term care system and our acute care system. Long-term care is, for the  		most part, not professional care; it is simply helping disabled elders with  		their everyday lives. Since formal care will always <b>supplement</b> informal  		care, not replace it, a challenge to the long-term care reform process is to  		spell out family roles and responsibilities. Where do family responsibilities  		end and public responsibilities begin? The reform proposals advanced to date  		have generally not addressed this basic issue explicitly, but they must.</p>
<h4>A Fragmented Financing System</h4>
<p>In the public sector, we finance long-term care services for the elderly  		through a multiplicity of programs. Disabled elders who are in need of services  		have a limited understanding of how these various programs work, who is  		eligible, and how services can be accessed by those who are eligible. This  		fragmentation creates problems in coordinating services across programs,  		because in many cases, individuals are eligible to receive publicly-financed  		services from more than one source simultaneously.</p>
<p>Medicare provides very limited coverage of long-term care, and, in fact,  		is purposively designed <b>not</b> to assist persons who only have chronic  		impairments. Medicare's Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) benefit and Home Health  		Care benefit are both targeted to persons recovering from acute illness  		episodes who are in need of skilled services, i.e. nursing and therapy  		services. A large number of discretionary programs, including those funded  		under the Older Americans Act, the Social Services Block Grant, HUD housing  		assistance programs, Veterans' Administration programs, and others, provide  		broadly-targeted resources to provide services and supports to the disabled  		elderly. However, the primary public funding source for long-term care is  		Medicaid, which covers long-term nursing home care, home health care, and  		non-medical home and community-based services to disabled elderly persons who  		meet Medicaid's financial criteria.</p>
<h4>The Role of Medicaid</h4>
<p>Medicaid accounts for over three-fourths of all public spending for  		long-term care (<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table1">Table 1</a>). Thus, our national long-term  		care policy is primarily based on a "welfare model" in which public assistance  		is made available only to those persons who do not have the financial resources  		to pay for their own care. The "welfare" orientation of our long-term care  		policy is severely criticized for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>People are forced to deplete all of their life savings on the  			 private cost of long-term care before they are eligible for public  			 assistance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people who have been financially independent all of their lives  			 are emotionally devastated by being dependent on "welfare" at the end of their  			 lives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people who have exhausted their resources paying for nursing  			 home care do not return home, even when they are functionally able, because  			 they can't afford to;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family caregivers often go to extraordinary lengths in providing  			 informal care in order to avoid the catastrophic costs of formally provided  			 care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because long-term care is financed through a welfare program, it is  			 difficult to garner political support for adequate funding; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system creates perverse incentives for the non-poor elderly to  			 'look poor"without really being poor by sheltering or divesting their financial  			 assets.</p>

</tr></table><p>At the same time, it is important to acknowledge some of the  		<i>positive</i> features of Medicaid as the primary funding source for  		long-term care. For one, it provides a relatively broad safety net for older  		persons who do not have the financial resources to pay for their own care.  		Second, it targets public resources fairly efficiently, because benefits are  		only provided, by and large, to the poor and near-poor. Third, the combination  		of Medicaid financing for the poor, and private financing for the non-poor, has  		helped to constrain costs and prices. We have generally not seen the type of  		cost inflation in the long-term care market that has occurred in the acute  		health care system. And fourth, the structure of the Medicaid program allows  		considerable flexibility for States to design long-term care systems in  		accordance with their own cultural, political and fiscal characteristics.</p>
<p>The welfare orientation of our national long-term care policy is often  		criticized for being too draconian. Shouldn't we allow individuals without  		spouses to keep more than $2,000 in assets (the current Medicaid eligibility  		resource threshold in most States) before qualifying for public benefits? But  		even if we agree that $2,000 is too miserly an amount, what is the appropriate  		amount: $10,000...$20,000...$100,000? Or should long-term care services be  		publicly-financed without regard to financial circumstances at all? To what  		degree should our national long-term care policy protect inheritances for the  		heirs of elderly persons who need long-term care services? Having to answer  		these questions in the policy debate may be unsettling...but as we consider the  		extent to which people should be responsible for financing their own care, they  		need to be explicitly addressed.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Medicaid now makes a clear distinction  		between financial eligibility criteria for married couples and for single  		persons. Under the spousal impoverishment provisions of the Medicare  		Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Medicaid's new financial eligibility  		criteria for married nursing home residents substantially enhances the  		financial security of spouses remaining in the community.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note5">5</a></font> For single persons, however, Medicaid policy takes  		the more restrictive position that most all of an individual's assets should be  		used to pay for private care before public assistance is made available.</p>
<h4>States Are Where the Action Is</h4>
<p>Because Medicaid is the primary public financing source for long-term  		care, and because there is considerable flexibility available to States in  		designing their Medicaid programs, States, much more than the Federal  		government, are the key actors in long-term care policymaking. The flexibility  		available to States is manifested in the diverse nature of State long-term care  		systems. The publicly- financed long-term care system in Minnesota is very  		different from the public long-term care system in New Mexico, which in turn is  		very different from the public long-term care systems of New York and Florida.  		Levels of funding for nursing home services and home and community based  		services differ dramatically across States, as shown in <a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table2">Table  		2</a>. Financial and functional eligibility criteria under Medicaid also vary  		from State to State.</p>
<p>The degree to which States have attempted to consolidate long-term care  		funding sources and programs into a coordinated administrative structure also  		differs. Oregon and Washington are examples of two States which have made  		serious efforts to implement consolidated systems that address the fragmented  		nature of public funding sources. Four States--California, Connecticut,  		Indiana, and New York--are also experimenting with the development of  		public-private partnerships to establish stronger linkages between the private  		and public long-term care insurance markets.</p>
<p>Although States have considerable flexibility in designing their own  		long-term care systems, some believe that public systems need to be even more  		flexible than they currently are. One accepted truism of long-term care is that  		disabled elders have highly diverse needs. The appropriate policy response to  		diverse needs are financing mechanisms that can tailor services and supports to  		individualized needs. If what a disabled elderly person really wants is someone  		to transport her best friend from across town so that the friend can help her  		clean the apartment, wash her clothes, and provide some companionship, then our  		public long-term care system ought to be flexible enough to accommodate that.  		Too often the choice is limited to a paid home care worker for two hours per  		day two days a week, and that's it. In regard to 24-hour supervised care, the  		choice is often restricted to a nursing home or nothing. Other residential  		options, like assisted living facilities, shared housing, and adult foster care  		need to be made more available under public programs. Thus, while Medicaid  		provides some flexibility in eligibility criteria and service coverage, many  		feel it is still a too rigid financing mechanism, and still based on the  		medical model.</p>

</tr></table><h4>The Shift Towards Home and Community-Based Care</h4>
<p>A final characteristic of our current long-term care system is the  		remarkable shift that has occurred towards home and community-based services in  		recent years. For example, between 1987 and 1991, Medicaid expenditures for  		nursing home care increased 54 percent, but expenditures for home and  		community-based services increased by 130 percent. Medicare home health  		expenditures also more than doubled over the same period, from $1.8 billion to  		almost $4.5 billion.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note6">6</a></font> Recent  		research indicates that the percentage of disabled elderly persons with ADL  		and/or IADL impairments who receive some type of formal home care (public  		and/or private) increased from 26 percent in 1982 to 33 percent in 1989.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note7">7</a></font> Although the "institutional bias" of  		our public long-term care system used to be severely criticized, this criticism  		is heard less frequently today. Indeed, we are more likely to hear about the  		difficulty people have in accessing nursing home care.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, access to publicly-financed home care services is highly  		uneven. In States that have very limited home care benefits under their  		Medicaid programs, many poor disabled elders receive no formal home care, no  		matter how disabled they are. A small handful of States account for the great  		majority of Medicaid spending for home care services. Thus, although there has  		been significant growth in public financing of community-based services, the  		demand for additional services is still great. However, since research has  		shown fairly convincingly that most recipients of home care services are not at  		immediate risk of nursing home placement, States remain wary of the cost  		implications of. expanding access to in-home services for their elderly  		Medicaid populations.</p>
<h4>What Will the Future Bring?</h4>
<p>In reforming long-term care policy, we should be careful not to enact  		solutions that address yesterday's problems. The policy challenges of the  		future are going to be substantially different than the policy challenges of  		today. Although it is not possible to predict the future with certainty, some  		demographic, social and economic trends <i>are</i> fairly predictable.</p>
<p>Over the next 40 years, the decline in mortality rates and the aging of  		the babyboomers will result in a doubling of the elderly population, to about  		66 million people. At the same time, the number of older persons at risk of  		disability and in need of long-term care services will increase even more  		rapidly. From 1990 to 2010, the number of persons age 85 and over will increase  		from 3.2 to 5.9 million. By 2030, there will be 7.7 million elderly persons age  		85 and over. After 2030, when the baby boom generation starts to turn age 85,  		this age cohort will grow even more rapidly. By 2050, there will be  		approximately 14.5 million persons age 85 and over.</p>
<p>The growth and aging of the elderly population will result in both a  		relative and absolute increase in the size of the disabled population, assuming  		disability rates remain constant.<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note8"><font>8</font></a>  		When the first birth cohorts of the baby boom generation turn 85 years old,  		there are likely to be over 20 million disabled elderly, almost a three-fold  		increase in the size of today's long-term care population.</p>
<p>Just as the demand for long-term care will be growing dramatically,  		there will be fewer working- aged adults to provide and/or pay for care. The  		ratio of the population 75 years of age and over to the population ages 20 to  		64 will more than double over the next sixty years.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note9">9</a></font> However, since the baby boom generation is currently  		just approaching middle age, this "dependency ratio" will not begin to rise for  		another 20 years or so.</p>
<p>Most forecasters believe that labor force participation rates among  		women, particularly those between the ages of 35 and 54, will continue to  		increase in future years. If true, some believe this will lessen the ability  		and/or willingness of women to provide unpaid care. Thus far, however, research  		has been unable to document that increased labor force participation among  		women has had a negative effect on their provision of informal care. Many women  		work <i>and</i> provide informal care at the same time. In addition, it is  		often overlooked that about one third of all informal caregivers are themselves  		elderly, and often retired. Finally, mortality trends suggest that more elderly  		women in the future will have their husbands with them longer, and while  		daughters are more likely to provide informal care than sons, male spouses have  		been shown to be as equally committed, to caring for their wives as females  		spouses are committed to their husbands. Thus, while it is often stated that  		there will be a dwindling supply of informal caregivers, to provide assistance  		to the disabled elderly in future years, this effect is probably  		overstated.</p>
<h4>Other Trends May Reduce the Demand for Long-Term  		Care</h4>
<p>On a more optimistic note, other trends may lessen future demand for  		long-term care. For one, it is possible that the incidence of disability among  		future elderly cohorts will decrease. Reduced smoking rates, reduced incidence  		of heart disease through better eating habits, blood pressure and cholesterol  		screening programs, and more frequent exercise, may all improve the health  		status of future elderly cohorts and reduce the rate of disability in their  		later years.</p>
<p>The elderly of tomorrow will also be better educated than the elderly of  		today, and studies show that higher education levels are associated with  		healthier lifestyles and an increased ability to adapt to changing life  		situations. Clearly, a major medical breakthrough which either reduced the  		prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and/or improved its response to treatment  		would greatly affect the demand for long-term care in future years as well.</p>
<h4>The Future Affordability of Long-Term Care</h4>
<p>Economic trends will affect the future affordability of long-term care,  		and, in turn, the demand for publicly-financed care. The income of elderly  		Americans has increased substantially over the past twenty years, and most  		projections indicate that the real incomes of the elderly will continue to  		increase. The average annual income for elderly families is estimated to  		increase from less than $20,000 in 1988 to over $30,000 in 2018 (in constant  		1988 dollars). The number of elderly living below the poverty line is estimated  		to decline from about 5.4 million to about 2.9 million persons over the next 30  		years.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note10">10</a></font></p>
<p>Although financial asset levels (net worth less home equity) are  		difficult to project, since they are very dependent upon the overall  		performance of the national economy, the amount of assets held by elderly  		persons is also expected to increase. By 2018, the proportion of elderly  		persons with less than $5,000 in financial assets is projected to decrease from  		39 percent to 27 percent, while the proportion with $25,000 or more will  		increase from 45 percent to 57 percent. This increased wealth of the elderly  		will result in part from real increases in Income over the period, and  		therefore increased savings.</p>
<p>The improving economic status of elderly Americans suggests that more  		elderly will be able to purchase their own care or protect themselves from  		catastrophic long-term care costs. With their increased wealth, the elderly  		will also have greater incentive to buy risk protection (assuming no expansion  		in public insurance). But even though many elderly may have increased financial  		resources, the cost of buying services from formal providers is also expected  		to increase. The great majority of elderly will not be able to afford long term  		care unless they save for their future needs well in advance of old age, and  		spread the risk of financing long term care by participating in risk pooling  		arrangements.</p>
<p>Savings rates (the proportion of total income saved) must increase if  		the future elderly are to be able to finance their own long-term care needs. It  		is expected that individuals will increasingly plan for retirement in two  		stages: (1) by saving money to cover living expenses for their active years;  		and (2) by purchasing insurance to pay for increased medical and long term care  		expenditures in their "very old" years.</p>
<h4>Some Elderly Will Always Be Poor</h4>
<p>Although the elderly of the future will be financially better off than  		the elderly of today, there will always be elders who are unable to finance  		their own care. These economically disadvantaged elderly are likely to be very  		old, widows, and people living alone--those most likely to require long term  		care. These persons will continue to rely on public programs for assistance  		with long-term care, since they will not be able to afford to purchase their  		own care, or buy private insurance.</p>
<h2><a name="partII" id="partII">PART II</a>. REFORMING LONG-TERM CARE POLICY: WHAT ARE  		THE OPTIONS?</h2>
<p>There has been no lack of proposals for reforming our nation's long-term  		care policy, and it is not possible in this paper to discuss them all. However,  		most of the proposals are variations of a smaller number of basic models, of  		which we will discuss four: (1) Public insurance; (2) Medicaid reforms; (3) New  		Federal-State programs; and (4) Voluntary risk pooling (insurance). In this  		section of the paper, we describe these basic models, discuss common variations  		of the models, and where applicable, refer to specific examples of recent  		legislation which reflect a particular approach.</p>
<p>We also present the principal arguments that have been made in support  		of each particular model, along with the major arguments that have been  		articulated in opposition. Although space limitations preclude us from  		including every point of view that has been made in the policy debate, we hope  		to summarize the major points of contention in an accurate and equitable  		manner.</p>
<h3><a name="partIIA" id="partIIA">Public Insurance</a></h3>
<p>Many reform proposals argue that coverage of long-term care services  		should primarily be a <b>public</b> responsibility, not a <b>private</b>  		responsibility. These proposals offer extensive public coverage of long- term  		care without means-testing, meaning that <i>all</i> disabled elderly persons  		would qualify for benefits regardless of their economic means. Most long-term  		care services, other than informally provided care, would be provided by the  		public sector, and the cost of providing these services would be financed  		through a significant increase in taxes.</p>
<p>However, there are many variations of the public insurance model (see  		<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table3">Table 3</a>). On the benefits side (what will be covered)  		proposals range from limited expansions in public coverage (beyond what public  		programs presently pay for) to comprehensive public insurance, in which private  		payments for services would be virtually eliminated. An example of the latter  		is the Universal Health Care Act of 1991 (HR 1300), sponsored by Congressman  		Marty Russo (D-IL), which proposed universal and comprehensive coverage for  		medically necessary nursing home care and home care services without any  		copayments or deductibles. This coverage would be provided as part of a  		national health insurance program that covered both acute and long-term care  		services under a new public program.</p>

</tr></table><p>However, most reforms which propose significant expansions in public  		coverage retain <i>some</i> private responsibility for long-term care in the  		form of deductibles, copayments or means-testing. For example, a bill submitted  		by Congressman Pete Stark (D-CA) in January 1991, the MediPlan Long- Term Care  		Act (H.R. 651) provides for 80 percent coverage of all nursing home and home  		care costs, as well as a two-month deductible for nursing home coverage. A  		proposal developed by the American Association for Retired Persons, called  		Health Care America, although proposing comprehensive public coverage of  		nursing and home care services, still retains income-related copayments,  		requiring nursing home recipients to contribute up to 35 percent of their  		income, or a maximum of $952 per month.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note11">11</a></font></p>
<p>Another bill, sponsored by Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA), the  		Long-Term Care Security Act Of 1992, reflects many of the recommendations made  		by the recent Pepper Commission.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note12">12</a></font>  		The bill proposes public coverage for the first 180 days of any nursing home  		stay, after which public coverage would be provided once nursing home users  		spent down their assets to $30,000 for individuals and $60,000 for married  		couples. A 20 percent copayment is also required for both nursing home and home  		care services.</p>
<p>Thus, while there are numerous proposals to provide fairly comprehensive  		public coverage of long- term care, most fall short of universal coverage.  		Deductibles, copayment requirements, and means- testing are often retained in  		various forms to: (1) reduce inappropriate overutilization; (2) reduce program  		costs; and (3) target benefits to those in most financial need.</p>
<h4>Financing Models for Public Insurance</h4>
<p>Expanded public financing of long-term care would entail a major shift  		in how the costs of formal long-term care will be shared by our society. In  		evaluating public insurance models, it is important to assess not only who  		benefits, but who pays. The distribution of the cost burden will depend upon  		the specific tax and financing mechanisms that are used to generate the  		revenues needed to pay for public benefits.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand how the current costs of long-term  		care are distributed throughout society. About 50 percent of all  		<i>formal</i><font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note13">13</a></font> long-term care  		costs are borne privately by the individuals who use formal care (primarily  		private payments for nursing home care). The remaining 50 percent of formal  		long-term care costs is <i>already</i> borne by the public sector, 38 percent  		by the Medicaid program. Medicaid program costs, in turn, are paid out of  		Federal and State general revenues, primarily income taxes.</p>
<p>A <i>social insurance</i> approach, modeled on Social Security and  		Medicare, would finance benefits for current beneficiaries from payroll taxes  		on current workers.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note14">14</a></font> Under social  		insurance, workers would "pay into" the system during their working years, and  		draw benefits out of the system when they need long- term care during their  		elderly years. Like Social Security and Medicare, a social insurance approach  		to financing long-term care would-be built upon social pacts between successive  		generations of workers.</p>
<p>If enacted today, a social insurance program for long-term care would  		create a "windfall" for the current generation of elderly who would have never  		paid into the system, but who would be eligible for publicly-financed benefits.  		There are also significant concerns about the burden which a social insurance  		program would place on future generations of workers, particularly in about  		30-40 years when the aging of the baby boom generation will dramatically change  		the worker to beneficiary ratio.</p>
<p>Consequently, broader-based financing mechanisms have also been proposed  		to finance a public insurance program for long-term care. For example,  		increased taxes on unearned income, along with an increase in payroll taxes,  		would distribute costs more evenly across all age groups, since individuals  		over the age of 55 hold the vast majority of the nation's financial assets, and  		earn the majority of unearned income. This could include increased taxation of  		Social Security benefits for beneficiaries with high incomes. Another possible  		financing mechanism, proposed for example in the Long-Term Care Family Security  		Act of 1992, is to increase inheritance taxes by lowering the value of estates  		that are exempt from Federal tax from $600,000 to $200,000. This latter  		proposal might be termed a "buy now, pay later" approach, since the government  		would pay for your long- term care while you are alive, but then collect from  		your estate upon your death.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note15">15</a></font></p>
<p>In sum, how the costs of a public insurance program would be paid for is  		as important as what benefits would be covered, and who would be eligible to  		receive them. Like private insurance, a public insurance program would  		<b>reduce</b> the costs to most individuals who needed long-term care services  		(since the value of the benefits received would generally exceed their  		contributions to the program) and <b>increase</b> costs to those who paid into  		the system, but never used benefits. Unlike private insurance, however,  		participation in the insurance risk pool would be mandatory, not optional. In  		addition, a public program is likely to include an income redistribution  		component, in which "premium" costs are income (or wealth) related, while  		benefits for all eligibles would be equal.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note16">16</a></font></p>
<h4>The Argument for Public Insurance</h4>
<p>Many arguments have been made in, support of a public insurance approach  		to financing our nation's long-term care system.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note17">17</a></font> These arguments include:</p>
<p><b>Universal Access</b>. All persons who needed long-term care would be  		provided access to care without regard to their ability to pay. Persons with  		long-standing chronic conditions would not be denied access to care due to  		"uninsurability." Discriminatory admission policies against poorer (Medicaid)  		patients, in order to increase profitability, would be attenuated.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note18">18</a></font></p>
<p><b>Equity</b>. All persons would be entitled to the same standard  		benefit, regardless of their economic position. The current system is  		two-tiered, with private pay patients often receiving a higher quality of care  		than Medicaid patients. Wealthier individuals could, of course, still purchase  		additional amenities not covered under the public program, but the basic  		standard of care would be raised for everyone. Also, since the program would be  		Federally-financed, differences in access and quality which currently exist  		across states would diminish.</p>
<p><b>Protection Against Catastrophic Costs</b>. Since all persons would be  		covered under a public program, all individuals would be protected from the  		risk of being impoverished by catastrophic long-term care costs. This  		protection would be provided to all elderly individuals, not just those who  		could afford to buy risk protection in the private market.</p>
<p><b>Dedicated Financing</b>. Since a public long-term care program is  		likely to be financed by dedicated taxes (taxes devoted exclusively to the  		purpose of financing long-term care) the financial stability of the program  		would be increased. The financial solvency of the long-term care "trust fund"  		would be ensured through long-range planning, not year-to-year fluctuations in  		Federal revenues and spending.</p>
<p><b>Broad-Based Insurance</b>. All taxpayers or workers would be required  		to pay taxes to finance the system in return for program benefits if they  		became disabled. Thus, a broad (universal) insurance risk pool would be  		created. This means that the costs of long-term care would be spread across a  		very broad group of users, not just the disabled. Since many contributors to  		the system will <b>not</b> need long-term care services before they die, the  		cost to any single contributor is minimized.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note19">19</a></font></p>
<p><b>Administrative Efficiency</b>. Compared to private insurance systems,  		public programs like Social Security and Medicare, since they are so large,  		have low administrative costs relative to the amount of premiums paid. This  		maximizes their administrative efficiency and provides a better return on  		premiums than small risk pools, which have higher administrative costs. For  		example, significant savings are achieved by not having to pay for the  		marketing of insurance policies, since <b>everyone</b> must participate (i.e.,  		everyone <b>has</b> to buy a policy). Administrative efficiencies are also  		achieved on the supply side since providers need only bill and be regulated by  		a single payer.</p>
<p><b>Buying Power</b>. Since a public insurance program creates an  		extremely large buyer of long-term care services (a "monopsony") substantial  		leverage is created in the government's ability to regulate the prices which  		suppliers of long-term care can charge for their services.</p>
<p><b>Protection of the Elderly Poor</b>. Proponents argue that a  		broad-based public insurance program is the best political strategy for raising  		the public revenues needed to care for persons who cannot afford to purchase,  		long-term care in the private market. In the absence of a public insurance  		program, they claim, it will be increasingly difficult to raise the necessary  		taxes to pay for the long-term care of the poor elderly served by Medicaid.</p>
<h4>The Argument Against Public Insurance</h4>
<p>While the arguments in favor of public insurance may be compelling to  		many people, others believe just as strongly that it is the wrong road to take  		in long-term care reform. People who take issue with a broad-based public  		insurance program make the following counter-arguments:</p>
<p><b>Finance Long-Term Care Through Savings and Investment, Not Income  		Transfers</b>. Opponents of public insurance for long-term care argue that  		financing long-term care is fundamentally about saving (and risk pooling) for  		the future. National long-term care policy should be built on a system of  		savings and risk pooling, and the productive investment of risk pools, to meet  		future needs. Each generation should be responsible for financing its own  		long-term care, and not shift the burden to subsequent generations. In public  		insurance programs, they argue, there is no real accumulation of reserves, or  		the productive investment of reserves, only income transfers between  		individuals. Even under social insurance financing models, such as Social  		Security and Medicare, they argue that there is no real accumulation of  		reserves, only the promise of the Federal government to meet future  		commitments.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note20">20</a>, <a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note21">21</a></font></p>
<p><b>Increased Social Expenditures for Long-Term Care</b>. Critics argue  		that the availability of universal insurance for long-term care will greatly  		increase the demand for formal services ("moral hazard" effects). By lowering  		price barriers to formal services, total utilization of long-term care will  		increase dramatically. There will be a substantial shift from informal to  		formal care, as families seek to maximize public benefits. In consequence,  		there will not just be a displacement of public spending for private spending,  		but an increase in total national spending for long-term care services. The  		cost estimates for public insurance proposals presented in <a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table3">Table 3</a> include assumptions about induced demand for formal  		services that would result from universal coverage.</p>
<p><b>Politicization of Price and Quality</b>. In a single-payer system,  		prices and quality standards would be established primarily through public  		regulation, not through competition in the marketplace. Long- term care  		suppliers will attempt to maximize profitability through manipulation of the  		political process, rather than offering a superior product at the best price.  		Public expenditures will increase because providers will be more influential in  		the political process than the taxpaying public.</p>
<p><b>Limited Choice</b>. A public insurance program will have a uniform  		benefit package. In sum, everyone in the system will "buy" the same insurance  		product. Although the government could modify the benefit package over time,  		critics argue that the government would not be as flexible as the marketplace  		in being responsive to changing consumer preferences. For example, in the  		current long-term care market, a range of 24-hour residential care alternatives  		to nursing homes (e.g. Continuing Care Retirement Communities, assisted living  		facilities, adult foster care programs) have developed in response to consumer  		preferences. Critics claim that these types of market innovations would be less  		likely to occur in a publicly-financed system.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note22">22</a></font></p>
<p><b>Formalization of the Long-Term Care System</b>. Most long-term care  		provided in the United States is informal care. Not only family members caring  		for each other, but neighbors, friends, and community organizations voluntarily  		helping the disabled members of their communities. Universal access to paid  		services would displace much of this informal care with formal care. Some claim  		this would actually lead to a less "caring" long-term care system in the long  		run.</p>
<p><b>Poor Targeting of Public Resources</b>. Medicaid currently pays for  		about 40 percent of all long-term care costs, and these resources are targeted  		to the elderly poor, and those who have depleted their private resources in  		nursing homes. Opponents claim that the primary beneficiaries of a universal  		public insurance program would be middle and upper class elderly persons, most  		of whom can well afford to pay for their own care, or buy private insurance  		without public assistance.</p>
<p><b>Estate Protection Not a Public Policy Issue</b>. One effect of a  		public insurance program for long-term care would be to protect inheritances.  		The program would protect the assets of long-term care users, rather than force  		the depletion of those assets to buy care in private markets. Estate  		protection, critics argue, particularly for persons without spouses, is not a  		public policy goal. This distinguishes long-term care from Social Security and  		Medicare, both of which have the legitimate policy goal of <b>preserving</b>  		the economic well-being of elderly people during their retirement years. In  		brief, opponents ask: why is the depletion of private assets for long-term care  		at the end of someone's life a public policy concern, as long as the government  		provides a safety net (i.e. Medicaid) for those who deplete all of their  		assets? Should taxpayers be forced to pay increased taxes so that the children  		of long-term care users can have their Inheritances protected?</p>
<p>Both sides of the policy debate clearly have formidable arguments, and  		these arguments should be developed further as the debate moves forward. Future  		debate on the relative merits of long-term care financing proposals should  		address the specific arguments discussed above. Proponents of public insurance  		argue that some of the concerns raised by opponents could be addressed through  		specific design features of the public program.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note23">23</a></font> For instance, a public insurance program could  		still promote competition in the marketplace through preferred provider  		contracts with superior providers, or by encouraging the development of  		capitated delivery systems similar to the Social HMO model. There are also  		those who argue that aside from the objective merits of a public insurance  		program, the political reality is that the Federal government would never be  		able to raise the tax revenues needed to finance a national long-term care  		program with universal coverage. In light of that reality, they argue,  		incremental reforms are only the possible option for expanded public  		coverage.</p>
<h4>Limited Expansions in Public Insurance</h4>
<p>In contrast to long-term care reform proposals which provide universal  		access to comprehensive benefits, others have proposed more modest expansions  		in public benefits. Unlike comprehensive public insurance, limited expansions  		are less likely to be financed as a social insurance program, and are more  		likely to be financed out of general revenues. However, they would still  		provide expanded public benefits (e.g. Medicare expansions) without  		means-testing, meaning that benefits would be provided without regard to  		ability to pay. In this section, we discuss three "limited expansion" models  		that appear to have some support in the long-term care policy debate:</p>
<ul><li>A "short-term" nursing home benefit;</li>
<li>"Catastrophic" nursing home coverage; and</li>
<li>A home care benefit.</li>
</ul><h4>Short-Term Nursing Home Benefit</h4>
<p>A short-term nursing home benefit was one of several expansions in  		publicly-financed long-term care recommended by The Pepper Commission. The  		Commission proposed that the Medicare SNF benefit be expanded to cover the  		<b>first three months</b> of a certified nursing home stay, including  		<b>both</b> skilled care and custodial care. Eligible beneficiaries would be  		required to pay a copayment equal to 20 percent of actual costs, or 20 percent  		of the national average cost of nursing home care, whichever was lower.  		Individuals could be eligible for more than one episode of coverage, although  		provisions would be enacted to prevent "revolving door" coverage.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note24">24</a></font></p>
<p>A short-term nursing home benefit would provide some public coverage for  		the approximately one million elderly persons who are admitted to nursing homes  		each year. It would provide <b>complete</b> coverage for the 23 percent of  		these admissions who are discharged back to the community within three months.  		Most importantly, it would extend coverage to beneficiaries who do not  		currently meet Medicare's relatively strict criteria for skilled care. The  		estimated increased cost of this relatively modest expansion in public benefits  		(over current outlays) is estimated at $5.5 billion in 1993, as shown in  		<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table3">Table 3</a>.</p>
<p>Proponents of expanded public financing for short-term nursing home care  		argue that it supports the original goals of the Medicare program: to provide  		the elderly with financial protection from acute illness. Most people who use  		short-term nursing home care do so during recovery from an acute illness  		episode, but many people feel that the current Medicare SNF benefit is too  		narrowly targeted to provide true coverage of post-acute care recovery. By  		limiting coverage to short-term stays, benefits would be targeted to nursing  		home users with the highest probability of being discharged home. Further, a  		short-term nursing home benefit would promote continuity of coverage between  		inpatient hospital stays and post-acute nursing home care by ensuring that all  		admissions to post- acute care are covered by the same payment source.  		Presently, the discharge of patients from hospitals to nursing homes is often  		hindered by nursing homes' uncertainty about coverage/payment for new  		admissions.</p>
<p>A short-term nursing home benefit would help preserve the economic  		security of elderly persons who have a reasonable chance of recovering to an  		independent life style. Asset protection for those who are unlikely to ever be  		discharged from a nursing home <i>is not</i> a policy objective of this  		approach. Finally, by picking up the front end of all nursing home stays, the  		cost of private long term care insurance for extended nursing home care would  		decline somewhat, increasing the percentage of elderly persons who could afford  		to purchase coverage for longer stays.</p>
<p>It is important to note that The Pepper Commission did not propose a  		front-end nursing home benefit as the only expansion in public support of  		long-term care services, but as one of a number of expansions, including added  		protection for long nursing home stays and expanded public coverage of home  		care services. However, others have proposed front-end nursing home coverage as  		a relatively low cost stand-alone proposal that would restore some of the  		expanded nursing home benefits temporarily enacted, then repealed, under the  		Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.</p>
<p>Detractors of short-term nursing home coverage have generally argued  		that public resources would be more wisely used to provide catastrophic  		coverage for persons with very long nursing home stays ("catastrophic  		coverage"). Thus, rather than discussing specific criticisms of front-end  		coverage proposals, we proceed directly to a discussion of a "catastrophic"  		nursing home benefit.</p>
<h4>Catastrophic Nursing Home Coverage</h4>
<p>In contrast to expanded public coverage of short-term nursing home  		stays, a "catastrophic" nursing home benefit would target public coverage to  		persons who require extended nursing home care. For example, a bill sponsored  		by Senator George Mitchell (D-ME) (S. 2305) in the 100th Congress, proposed to  		provide public coverage after an individual had spent two years in a nursing  		home.</p>
<p>The rationale for a "catastrophic" nursing home benefit is that it would  		provide "stop-loss" protection for extraordinarily large nursing home costs,  		which proponents claim is the primary concern of the elderly, not the financial  		consequences of short nursing home stays. Resources would be targeted to  		individuals and families faced with the most debilitating chronic illnesses,  		such as Alzheimer's disease. Proponents argue that it is the specter of total  		impoverishment resulting from extended nursing home care that the elderly fear  		most. A short-term nursing home benefit would do little to relieve that  		concern.</p>
<p>Like a front-end nursing home benefit, a catastrophic benefit would  		reduce the cost of private insurance for uncovered benefits.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note25">25</a></font> Some claim that catastrophic coverage would create  		a more stable private insurance market because the risk of private insurance  		plans would be limited by public "back-end" insurance. Insurers could better  		predict their costs, and price their products more competitively (and  		accurately) than in today's environment, where insurers are liable for  		unlimited coverage. By reducing the cost of risk protection for uncovered  		nursing home stays, a catastrophic public benefit would greatly encourage the  		purchase of insurance coverage for the deductible period.</p>
<p>The primary criticism of catastrophic nursing home coverage concerns who  		would benefit from such a program. Depending upon the length of the deductible  		period, a catastrophic benefit could end up providing benefits primarily to  		relatively wealthy elderly persons, not those who are in most need of financial  		help. For example, if the front-end deductible were two years, as In the  		Mitchell bill, only those elderly who could afford to pay for at least two  		years of private care (about $60,000 on average) would benefit. Persons with  		fewer assets would <b>already</b> be impoverished by the time they were  		eligible for the new benefit, and would already be eligible for public  		assistance under Medicaid. A catastrophic coverage program would provide these  		persons with no increased financial protection whatsoever. Thus, by expanding  		public benefits to persons who can now afford to -pay for their own care, a  		catastrophic benefit could be criticized as a regressive program which  		transfers tax dollars from the non-wealthy to the wealthy.</p>
<p>Even with a two-year deductible, a back-end benefit would still carry a  		high price tag--about $13 billion in increased public outlays in 1993 (see  		<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table3">Table 3</a>). Public outlays would increase further in  		subsequent years as more nursing home users met the two-year deductible  		requirement. Costs are higher for catastrophic coverage because persons with  		long nursing home stays account for a very high proportion of total nursing  		home utilization.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note26">26</a></font> If the program  		was Federally-financed, States would reap a windfall, however, since a back-end  		benefit would pay for many nursing home users now covered by Medicaid.</p>
<h4>A Home Care Benefit</h4>
<p>Another limited reform option is to expand public coverage of home care  		services without expanding coverage of nursing home care. It is possible to  		argue that the policy objectives of a home care benefit program are  		qualitatively different from the objectives of an expanded nursing home  		benefit. For one, expanded home care benefits are more akin to current Medicare  		benefits in that they would provide financial protection against the  		out-of-pocket costs of maintaining individuals at home. Home care would help  		individuals maintain their "quality of life" in the community, and protect them  		from the distress of either purchasing expensive home care services on their  		own, or becoming a burden on family members. Once an individual enters a  		nursing home, it can be argued that there is less justification for protecting  		an individual's financial assets, particularly if there is little likelihood  		that the individual will return to the community.</p>
<p>Examples of two home care benefit proposals include one advanced by The  		Commonwealth Fund Commission on Elderly People Living Alone in 1989 and another  		proposed by The Pepper Commission in 1990.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note27">27</a></font> The Commonwealth Fund proposal is limited to  		disabled <i>elderly</i> persons, while the Pepper Commission proposal  		encompasses both elderly and non-elderly persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund proposed expanding the Medicare benefit package to  		include home care services for persons with chronic conditions. Elderly  		individuals with limitations in two more ADLs and cognitively impaired persons  		with. comparable limitations would be entitled to between 15 and 25 hours of  		home care services per week, depending upon level of disability. Recipients  		would be required to pay 20 percent of costs as a copayment, although Medicaid  		would cover the full share of copayment requirements for persons with incomes  		below the poverty level, and would-share copayment costs with persons between  		100 and 200 percent of poverty. The Commonwealth Fund estimated that  		approximately 1.6 million disabled elderly would be eligible for home care  		benefits under this proposal. The estimated cost of this expansion is about  		$7.7 billion in 1993 (<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table3">Table 3</a>).</p>
<p>The Pepper Commission proposal used somewhat different eligibility  		criteria for their proposed home care benefit. It proposed that home care  		benefits be made available to: (a) persons who need hands-on <b>or</b>  		supervisory assistance with three of more ADLs; (b) persons who need constant  		supervision due to cognitive impairments; and (c) persons who need constant  		supervision due to difficult behaviors. Because The Pepper Commission criteria  		include persons who need supervisory as well as hands-on assistance with ADLs,  		the estimated eligible population totaled 2.0 million persons, 25 percent  		larger than the target population proposed by The Commonwealth Fund.</p>
<p>Like the Commonwealth Fund proposal, the Pepper Commission proposed  		imposing a 20 percent copayment requirement on home-care recipients, with  		comparable Medicaid coverage of copayments for persons with low incomes. The  		Commission also proposed that case managers be assigned the responsibility of  		devising a care plan for each individual eligible for services within an  		overall budgetary cap, which would be adjusted according to an individual's  		level of disability.</p>
<p>The estimated public cost of the Pepper Commission home care proposal is  		about $16.8 billion in 1993 (<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table3">Table 3</a>). This is more than  		double the estimated cost of The Commonwealth Fund proposal. In addition to  		targeting a somewhat broader population, The Pepper Commission proposal assumes  		higher utilization levels, since It does not cap the number of hours of service  		any particular individual can receive, and somewhat higher costs per home care  		visit.</p>
<p>These differences in the estimated costs of a home care benefit  		underscore the difficulty of making accurate projections of participation and  		utilization in an expanded public home care program. The number of persons  		potentially eligible for home care services can vary substantially with only  		slight changes in the disability criteria used to determine eligibility.<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note28"><font>28</font></a> Second, it is difficult to estimate what proportion of  		persons eligible for benefits would actually use services, since some  		individuals and family members will prefer to retain informal caregiving  		arrangements, without formal help. Third, program costs will also be extremely  		dependent upon utilization controls imposed on the program, as well as  		reimbursement rates paid to formal home care providers. Existing public home  		care programs range from using volunteers for certain non-skilled services  		(e.g., Meals-on-Wheels programs) to using highly skilled nurses to provide care  		to persons with serious medical and chronic conditions.</p>
<p>While there is considerable political support for the expansion of  		publicly-financed home care benefits, there has not been extensive debate  		regarding the policy objectives of such an expansion. For example, public  		funding of new home care benefits should be based upon empirical information  		about persons who are <b>not</b> being served adequately under existing policy.  		Before we enact a new public home care program, we should ask: "What is the  		magnitude of 'unmet needs' among the current disabled elderly, and what groups  		are being underserved by both the formal and informal care system? What groups  		of informal caregivers experience the greatest emotional, physical, and  		financial distress as a result of their caregiving responsibilities? What types  		of people experience the greatest financial stress from having to purchase  		formal home care services out of private income?" <i>Although the data to  		address these questions have many limitations, there is no strong evidence to  		date that show large numbers of disabled elderly living at home have unmet  		needs, that most informal caregivers feel overly burdened, or that more than a  		small number of people are experiencing high out-of-pocket costs for formal  		home care services.</i></p>
<p>Another concern that has been expressed about expansions in public home  		care benefits is that they do not come to grips with the issue of family roles  		and responsibilities versus public responsibilities. Most home care reform  		proposals have failed to take into account the presence or absence of family  		caregivers in allocating public home care benefits. There is some concern that  		a significant expansion in public home care benefits will "substitute" for care  		that has been traditionally provided by families. This could lead, critics  		argue, to an erosion of traditional family relationships; a less caring, more  		formalized, long-term care system; and Increased societal costs for the  		production of long-term care services (since informal care is less costly).  		However, research conducted to date provides little empirical support for these  		concerns, since the addition of formal home care services into households has  		been shown to have little impact on the quality of informal care provided.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note29">29</a></font> Rather, it appears that informal  		caregivers are more likely to rearrange their informal caregiving hours,  		without reducing their total effort, such that care recipients end up getting  		<i>more</i> care overall.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note30">30</a></font> It  		must be recognized, however, that the results of small-scale lied conditions  		may <i>not</i> hold true in a dramatic policy change in the public financing of  		home care services.</p>
<h3><a name="partIIB" id="partIIB">Medicaid Reforms</a></h3>
<p>Our current long-term care system allocates the great majority of public  		benefits through means-testing. (i.e. the Medicaid program). Long-term care  		reform options which propose to retain the principle of means-testing in  		allocating public benefits are <b>fundamentally</b> different from reforms  		which propose to establish coverage of long-term care benefits without regard  		to financial need. They differ not only in terms of who qualifies for benefits,  		but in terms of how benefits are financed, who administers benefits, and how  		resources are allocated to eligible recipients. For example, since most  		means-tested programs are administered by State governments, not the Federal  		government, it is likely that a means-tested long-term care program would  		retain a significant State role in the policy process, with resulting  		State-to-State variation in eligibility criteria and benefit packages.</p>
<p>In considering alternative long-term care reform strategies, the  		decision of whether to extend long-term care benefits to <i>all</i> disabled  		elderly persons without regard to financial need, or whether to target  		resources only to those who meet financial need criteria is a critical one. It  		should precede discussions about benefit packages or disability criteria. A  		means-tested approach affirms that persons of adequate financial means are  		responsible for financing their own long-term care needs in private markets. A  		public insurance approach, in contrast, adopts the principles of the Medicare  		program--that all disabled elderly should be entitled to benefits without  		means-testing.</p>
<p>While affirming that public resources should be allocated according to  		financial need, reform proposals which retain means-testing nonetheless  		maintain that current Medicaid policy is inadequate.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note31">31</a></font> In brief, they reflect a desire to make Medicaid  		policy more generous than it now is, at least in most States.</p>
<p>While maintaining that private markets should continue to serve elderly  		persons with financial means, means-tested reforms acknowledge that many  		elderly, not eligible for Medicaid coverage, cannot afford to participate in  		the private long-term care market. A common goal of Medicaid reform is to  		narrow the gap between the public and private long-term care systems, so that  		fewer people are caught "in-between," i.e., they can neither afford to purchase  		their own long-term care (or buy insurance), nor are they eligible for public  		assistance.</p>
<p>This section discusses proposed reforms to expand Medicaid coverage of  		nursing home care and home and community-based services. <i>It is important to  		note that States already have considerable discretion to enact these kind of  		reforms, without new Federal legislation.</i> In recent years, States have been  		accorded increased flexibility by Congress in eligibility criteria and benefit  		design for long-term care coverage under Medicaid, and several States have  		taken advantage of this increased flexibility to enact reforms. But while  		States may have the legislative authority to implement significant Medicaid  		reforms, they may <b>not</b> have the political will or fiscal capacity to do  		so. Moreover, the flexibility offered States under Medicaid creates a  		dichotomy: the same flexibility which allows States to implement significant  		reforms on their own also leads to ever-larger discrepancies in public  		long-term care coverage across the 50 States. This variation in public  		coverage, in turn, leads to ever-more vociferous criticisms that the existing  		system is inequitable, and should be made more uniform across the nation.</p>
<h4>Reforms to Medicaid Coverage of Nursing Home Care</h4>
<p>A variety of incremental Medicaid reforms could improve financial  		protections for Medicaid recipients in nursing homes. Presently, single  		individuals generally must have less than $2,000 in countable assets before  		they can qualify for Medicaid coverage in nursing homes.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note32">32</a></font> Once eligible for Medicaid, they must  		also contribute almost all of their income to the cost of their care, except  		for a small personal need . s allowance. Possible reform options include:</p>
<p><b>Raise Medicaid resource levels for nursing home coverage</b>. This  		provision would increase the amount of countable assets a nursing home  		recipient could retain and still receive Medicaid coverage. The elderly would  		not have to totally impoverish themselves before qualifying for Medicaid  		coverage, thereby reducing the welfare stigma of the program somewhat. Medicaid  		recipients would retain a small level of wealth that they could still pass on  		as an inheritance to heirs. For example, raising the Medicaid resource level to  		$12,000 in all States would cost an additional $1.0 billion in total  		Federal/State spending in 1993 (see <a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table4">Table 4</a>).</p>
<p><b>Provide full asset protection under Medicaid for the first six months  		of a nursing home stay</b>. This provision would waive Medicaid resource  		criteria for the first six months of a nursing home stay, while retaining  		income criteria. In brief, if an elderly nursing home recipient could not  		afford to purchase private nursing home care from their income alone, they  		could receive Medicaid assistance for the difference between their available  		income and the private cost of care. They would <b>not</b> have to supplement  		their income by spending down assets. This provision is intended to provide  		asset protection for short nursing home stays, but differs from a public  		insurance program in its requirement that recipients contribute most of their  		income to the cost of care. After six months, Medicaid resource criteria would  		be applied, and recipients with excess resources would become ineligible, and  		have to begin drawing down their assets. Because most persons who are  		discharged to the community have short nursing home stays, this provision would  		provide asset protection only for those persons who are most likely to return  		home. It is estimated that this Medicaid reform would cost about $700 million  		annually in total Federal/State spending in 1993 (<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table4">Table  		4</a>).</p>
<p><b>Raise the Federal personal needs allowance from $30 to $100 per  		month</b>. This provision would allow Medicaid recipients to retain a higher  		amount of discretionary income for expenses such as haircuts, personal items,  		gifts, and room furnishings. This proposal would cost about $1.2 billion in  		1993, some of which would be reflected in higher SSI costs, since SSI pays for  		the personal needs allowance for Medicaid nursing home recipients with no  		income.</p>
<p><b>Require all States to provide medically needy coverage of nursing  		home care</b>. This proposal would affect the 19 so-called "income cap" States  		which limit Medicaid eligibility to persons with incomes below 300 percent of  		the Federal SSI benefit level ($1,422 per month in 1992). In these States,  		persons with incomes above the Medicaid eligibility level but below the private  		cost of nursing home care (which now averages about $2,500 per month) are  		caught in-between, even if they have depleted all of their assets. This reform  		would increase Medicaid costs in these 19 States by some $500 million  		annually.</p>
<p><b>Improve spousal impoverishment protections</b>. Although the Medicare  		Catastrophic Coverage Act substantially increased financial protections for the  		community spouses of Medicaid recipients in nursing homes, some believe these  		financial protections should be enhanced even further. In July 1992, protected  		income levels for community spouses rose to 150 percent of the poverty level.  		Raising protected income levels to 200 percent of poverty would cost about $1.2  		billion in new Federal/State Medicaid spending in 1993.</p>

</tr></table><p>While some proposals would broaden Medicaid coverage of nursing home  		care, others propose to <b>tighten</b> eligibility criteria for certain  		recipients. These proposals would reduce net Medicaid spending, which could be  		used to finance expansions for other groups. One proposal is to require that  		all States include home equity as a countable resource for Medicaid eligibility  		under certain circumstances. For example, home equity might no longer be  		excluded after a non-married recipient had been in a nursing home for six  		months, and is unlikely to be discharged home.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note33">33</a></font> At this point, the recipient's home would become a  		countable asset, and the recipient would be forced to sell the home, and  		deplete home equity assets before reapplying for Medicaid assistance.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note34">34</a></font> As shown in <a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table4">Table 4</a>, this  		policy change would yield an estimated $1.9 billion in Medicaid program savings  		in 1993. Alternatively, Medicaid recipients' private residences could remain an  		"exempt" resource, but States could be <b>required</b> to place liens on  		residential property and to recover Medicaid costs after the death of a  		recipient through estate recovery programs (this is presently an option).</p>
<p>Another savings option is to tighten eligibility "loopholes" that are  		used by some elderly persons, their children, and their attorneys to shelter or  		divest assets that would otherwise disqualify these persons from Medicaid  		coverage.<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note35"><font>35</font></a> These loopholes  		include the use of trusts and other financial Instruments that render income  		and/or assets of a nursing home recipient "unavailable" and therefore, not  		countable, in determining eligibility for Medicaid. While little empirical data  		exist on how much "Medicaid estate planning" is going on, and what effect it  		has on Medicaid long-term care spending, many state Medicaid officials view it  		as a growing problem with a large potential impact on future Medicaid  		costs.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note36">36</a></font></p>
<h4>Reforms to Medicaid Coverage of Home Care</h4>
<p>Access to home care services varies markedly across State Medicaid  		programs. For example, a few States (New York, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas)  		support broad in-home service programs for the elderly under the Medicaid  		personal care services option. Other states have expanded home and  		community-based services under the Section 2176 Medicaid waiver program.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note37">37</a></font> A few States (e.g. Massachusetts and  		California) also support means-tested home care programs outside the rubric of  		the Medicaid program. However, access to home care services by poor elderly  		persons with functional impairments is highly uneven across States, and Federal  		law still restricts Medicaid coverage of non-skilled home care. Targeted  		expansions could include:</p>
<p><b>Allow States to cover a broad range of home and community-based  		services under Medicaid, without restriction</b>. This reform would lift the  		restrictions currently placed on States regarding whom they may serve (only  		persons who meet nursing home criteria) and how many (a complicated formula)  		under their Section 2176 waiver programs. The "optional" Medicaid benefit  		package would be expanded to include a broader range of non-medical  		community-based services such as case management, homemaker, home health aide,  		adult day care, assistive technology, non-medical transportation, and in-home  		meals that help to maintain functionally dependent elderly persons in  		non-institutional settings. Cost estimates of this reform are confounded by not  		knowing how many States would elect this option and increase funding beyond  		their current programs. Net increased expenditures would probably not exceed  		$100-$300 million over the short term, but could increase significantly over  		the longer term with improved State fiscal capacity.</p>
<p><b>Raise Medicaid financial criteria for home care services</b>. Only  		about six percent of the elderly living in the community are enrolled in the  		Medicaid program at any one time.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note38">38</a></font> Broadening the Medicaid benefit package will  		therefore do little to assist functionally disabled elderly persons who are  		poor, but not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. An expansion of means-tested  		home care benefits could be enacted by raising Medicaid eligibility criteria  		for persons with functional disabilities.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note39">39</a></font> For example, a program which covered home care  		services for persons with three or more ADL impairments (and/or equivalent  		cognitive impairments), incomes below the poverty level, and assets of less  		than $5,000 is estimated to cost about $2 billion in 1993 dollars (over and  		above current Medicaid spending and assuming all States participated in such a  		program). Raising financial eligibility criteria to 200 percent of poverty,  		with no asset test, would increase costs to about $7 billion annually.</p>
<p>As discussed above, any expansion in means-tested coverage of long-term  		care services enacted under the existing structure of Medicaid would have to  		address whether States have the fiscal capacity to support such expansions.  		States already claim that recent Federal mandates to expand Medicaid have  		exceeded the ability of States to generate the revenues needed to finance new  		Medicaid spending. Thus, long-term care reform options which intend to expand  		coverage through means-tested program may have to consider financing strategies  		other than those which presently apply under Medicaid. For example, the Federal  		government could finance a higher percentage of new long-term care expansions  		than in the mainstream Medicaid program, or even fund the entire cost of new  		benefits.</p>
<h3><a name="partIIC" id="partIIC">New Federal-State Programs</a></h3>
<p>An alternative to Medicaid reforms is to replace Medicaid with an  		entirely new Federal-State arrangement for financing long-term care. This is  		not as remote a possibility as many might think. For example, should there be a  		dramatic restructuring of the Medicaid program as part of a broad- sweeping  		national health care reform initiative, or the replacement of Medicaid with a  		broader public insurance program for acute care, the question will remain about  		what to do with the residual "long-term care component" of Medicaid. The  		opportunity would arise to create a new program, or institute a major revamping  		of the current program, specifically designed to meet the needs of persons with  		chronic disabilities.</p>
<p>A new Federal-State partnership for financing long-term care is likely  		to possess a number of features that would not be present in a comprehensive  		public insurance program:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The program would remain jointly financed by States and the Federal  			 government, although formulas for determining the Federal share of total  			 program costs could be totally revised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like Medicaid, the program would probably be financed through  			 current operating revenues, not through earmarked taxes or a Trust Fund  			 reserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike a national public insurance program, a Federal-State program  			 is likely to accord greater authority to States over program design and  			 resource allocation decisions, although, as in Medicaid, the Federal government  			 is likely to establish minimal criteria for Federal financial  			 participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A joint Federal-State program would probably permit experimentation  			 with a range of long-term care financing and delivery systems that could evolve  			 along different paths, in contrast to the "single model" approach that would be  			 enacted under a uniform Federal program. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Although the types of program models that could be conceptualized in an  		entirely new Federal-State program are almost limitless, we will discuss a few  		possibilities:</p>
<h4>Secure Choice: A Restructured Medicaid Program with a  		Public-Private Partnership</h4>
<p>One suggested approach is to divorce the long-term care component of  		Medicaid from the current program, and create an entirely new Federal/State  		program for the financing of long-term care. An example of this approach is  		"Secure Choice" (S. 1668), a bill introduced by Senator Packwood of Oregon, in  		August of 1991. "Secure Choice" would add a new Title to the Social Security  		Act, specifically to finance long-term care services for low-income  		elderly.</p>
<p>Secure Choice has two parts. Part I provides public coverage for nursing  		home and home care services for elderly persons over the age of 55 with incomes  		up to 100% of the poverty level, although States would have the option of  		extending coverage to persons up to 240% of the poverty level. Eligibility for  		nursing home services would be limited to persons with less than $2,000 in  		countable assets (as in the current Medicaid program) but persons receiving  		home and community-based care could retain up to $5,000 in countable  		assets.</p>
<p>Secure Choice also establishes minimal functional criteria for benefit  		eligibility. Criteria for home and community based services coverage are less  		restrictive than for nursing home coverage. States would have the option of  		establishing copayment requirements for both nursing home and home care  		services, within Federal guidelines.</p>
<p>The second part of Secure Choice establishes a public-private  		partnership program for the coverage of long-term care services for the elderly  		middle class, although participation in this component of the program would be  		optional to States. Long-term care insurance benefit subsidies would be made  		available to elderly persons with incomes between 240% of poverty and 400% of  		poverty. Individuals in this income category would be offered the opportunity  		to purchase a private, but subsidized, long-term care insurance policy that  		would cover the same benefits covered under the first part of the program.  		Benefits would be subsidized according to a sliding income scale. For example,  		for persons at or below 240% of the poverty level, the public program would pay  		for 75% of covered benefits, and the private insurer would pay 25%. The share  		paid by the private insurer would increase gradually in accordance with the  		income level of the covered beneficiary.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note40">40</a></font> Since the public program would pay a greater share  		of covered benefits for beneficiaries with lower incomes, the premium costs of  		policies sold to lower income persons would be concomitantly lower as well,  		Premium costs would be lowered further by establishing a maximum lifetime  		benefit for these subsidized policies, after which all costs would be paid by  		the public program. "Secure Choice" establishes minimum standards for insurance  		policies sold under the public/private partnership program as well as for  		policies sold in the unsubsidized private market.</p>
<p>"Secure Choice" has not been the subject of much discussion in the  		policy arena to date. Although it is likely to be criticized for its  		administrative complexity,<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note41">41</a></font> the  		unique feature of this bill is its consolidation of a publicly-financed  		long-term care program for the elderly poor, with a public/private partnership  		program designed to lower the costs of private long-term care insurance  		policies for the elderly middle class.</p>
<h4>The Canadian Model</h4>
<p>An even more radical reform of Federal/State long-term care policy would  		be to eliminate Medicaid coverage of long-term care services altogether, and  		provide Federal financial support for long-term care to the States through a  		Long-Term Care Block Grant. Two primary objectives of a long-term care block  		grant would be: (1) to provide States with increased flexibility and authority  		over the allocation of public resources; and (2) to consolidate a fragmented  		long-term care financing system into a unified financing system.</p>
<p>A fundamental precept of the block grant approach is that long-term care  		policy and resource allocation decisions should be <b>decentralized</b>. Since  		the needs of persons with functional impairments are so diverse, some argue  		that long-term care financing mechanisms should be almost infinitely flexible  		in providing long-term care supports. States should be free to serve who they  		believe is most deserving of public assistance. This includes the ability to  		integrate formal services with the availability and willingness of informal  		caregivers to provide care. States should also be free to do or buy "whatever  		is necessary" to assist individuals with long-term care needs, be it housing  		assistance, direct care, supporting informal caregivers, or purchasing  		assistive devices.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note42">42</a></font></p>

</tr></table><p>A financing mechanism that allows for total flexibility in the use of  		Federal resources would encourage experimentation with new service delivery  		models, innovation in the use of assistive devices as a substitute for human  		assistance, and the testing of new methods for contracting with long-term care  		providers. In brief, a block grant endorses a "no strings attached" approach to  		the use of Federal long-term care resources. Moreover, consolidation of  		multiple funding streams under Medicaid, Title XX, the Older Americans Act, and  		other Federal programs into a single long-term care financing stream would help  		to reduce administrative inefficiencies in the current delivery of  		publicly-financed services.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Canada <i>does not</i> have a "national  		long-term care insurance program."<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note43">43</a></font> Since 1977, the Federal Canadian government has  		provided a per capita long-term care block grant to the ten Canadian provinces.  		These grants are annually indexed for inflation and, within very broad  		guidelines, provinces are free to use these funds at their own discretion,  		adding in local sources of revenue to support both facility-based and  		home-based services. Most of the provinces <b>do</b> provide nursing home  		coverage to their citizens without means-testing (i.e. there are no "asset  		criteria") although copayments <b>are</b> required to cover room and board  		costs. The provinces have similar discretion in regard to their support of home  		care programs, and there is considerable variation from province to province in  		the manner in which they have decided to finance and administer home care  		programs.</p>
<p>A United States variation of the Canadian approach could conceivably  		<b>consolidate</b> the 80 or more current Federal funding sources for long-term  		care into a single capitated block grant to the individual States, allocated  		according to State elderly population, with possible adjustments for State per  		capita income. States could be given considerable latitude in regard to  		disability criteria, financial eligibility criteria, benefit packages, quality  		assurance systems, and reimbursement methods.</p>
<p>One feature of the Canadian system that could be incorporated into a  		long-term care block grant in the United States is the separation of "room and  		board" costs in nursing homes from "service" costs. The public system could be  		responsible for service-related costs, while individuals could retain  		responsibility for room and board costs.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note44">44</a></font> Thus, persons with the financial means to do so  		could purchase more and better amenities through higher "hotel" costs, while  		ensuring that all persons in the system were treated equitably in regard to  		direct care services.</p>
<p>No legislative proposals have been submitted in Congress which endorse  		the block grant approach, and this approach would have many critics.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note45">45</a></font> Perhaps the largest fear among States  		and advocacy organizations is that a block grant provides little protection  		against future growth in the demand for long-term care services. Even if  		Federal allocations are indexed annually, the rise in public long- term care  		costs may increase at an even greater rate than the indexing factor, leaving  		States with an ever-increasing share of the long-term care financing burden.  		Fiscal pressures on the Federal government could lead to reductions in the  		index to meet budgetary constraints. Without mandated matching of Federal  		allocations, many people fear that State contributions to long-term care  		financing would decline as well, leading to overall reductions in long-term  		care funding. In brief, without the entitlement features of Medicaid financing,  		public funding of long-term care services might become a more vulnerable target  		to annual budgetary contingencies. Consequently, the long- term care provider  		industry is also likely to be opposed to a block grant approach. In any case,  		unless some type of assurances could be built into a long-term care block grant  		program that Federal and State funding of long-term care services would  		increase in accordance with the demand for care, this approach would probably  		generate little political support for enactment.</p>
<h4>A Capitated Long-Term Care Program</h4>
<p>In response to the problematic financing structures of a block grant  		program, an alternative would be to design a program which combined features of  		a block grant model (local discretion over resource allocation) with some of  		the entitlement features of Medicaid (open-ended Federal financing). Instead of  		a formula grant program to the states, the Federal government could make  		capitation payments to States based upon <b>actual program enrollment</b>.  		Program features could include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The Federal government would establish a mandatory eligible  			 population based on income and disability level (e.g. all persons with 2+ ADLs  			 with incomes below the poverty level).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Federal government would pay States a capitation amount for each  			 eligible disabled individual enrolled in the long-term care system and  			 receiving services. Capitation payments would be made for each month of service  			 receipt for each enrollee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who met basic disability and financial criteria would be  			 entitled to a minimum benefit package, including residential services and home  			 care. The Federal government would monitor States to ensure that services were  			 not being denied to the "entitled" group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Federal capitation payment amount would not necessarily equal  			 the total average cost of serving the mandatory population; States would be  			 expected to pay a percentage of total costs, as under Medicaid. Like Medicaid,  			 Federal capitation payments could also be adjusted according to State per  			 capita income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There would be no limit on the total Federal contribution.  			 Capitation payments to States would be open-ended, as under Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States, at their option, could elect to serve less disabled  			 populations and/or higher income groups, but the Federal contribution for these  			 "optional" groups would be at a lower percentage of average costs.  			 Alternatively, a Federal cap could be placed on spending for optional  			 groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Federal government could specify minimal criteria for State  			 quality assurance systems, conduct quality of care reviews for enrolled  			 clients, and levy financial penalties on States for noncompliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importantly, there would be no restrictions on the program benefit  			 package. States could use Federal capitation payments in any manner they chose  			 to, as long as they met the quality assurance criteria established under  			 Federal law.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>While a capitated benefit program would still provide States with broad  		flexibility in meeting the diverse needs of disabled elders, it would establish  		a stronger Federal role in ensuring access to services, and quality assurance.  		An "open-ended" financing structure would also provide guarantees that Federal  		and State contributions to the service system rose in proportion to the demand  		for care. This approach would also provide incentives for States to serve the  		most disabled and most needy, although they could elect to serve the less  		disabled and less financially needy if they chose to, albeit at a lower Federal  		matching rate.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that instead of making capitation payments took,  		capitation payments to <b>States</b>, could also be made available to  		<b>individuals</b> as a disability allowance. This approach embodies the  		objective of maximizing individual choice in deciding how public resources are  		used to purchase long-term care services. For example, instead of purchasing  		care from formal long-term care providers, individuals could elect instead to  		pay family members to provide care. (They may also elect <b>not</b> to use  		their allowance to buy long-term care services, but to buy something else  		altogether). Although there would be many risks associated with this "voucher"  		approach to financing long-term care services (e.g. increased potential for  		elder abuse by family members), its attractiveness lies in the increased  		control it places in the hands of the <b>consumers</b> of publicly-financed  		services. Critics are likely to have reservations about whether very old and  		disabled people, often with cognitive impairments, could effectively negotiate  		for services in a private market. The potential for fraud and abuse might be  		high.</p>
<h3><a name="partIID" id="partIID">Voluntary Insurance</a></h3>
<p>Regardless of whether people support expanded public benefits or an  		expanded private insurance market, one deficit of the existing system that most  		people agree on is the lack of opportunity for people to insure themselves  		against catastrophic long-term care costs.</p>
<p>Even those who believe that long-term care should primarily be a private  		responsibility acknowledge the drawbacks of a system in which a family's entire  		life savings can be wiped out simply because one family member needs extended  		care. Our societal values may reflect a belief that families have the primary  		responsibility for caring for their aged kin, but most people also believe that  		families should not be forced to suffer the financial and emotional  		consequences of becoming totally impoverished by long-term care costs.</p>
<p>Financial structures need to be created which allow families to share  		these risks. Whether we share these risks by creating voluntary risk pools  		(private insurance) or mandatory risk pools (public insurance) is a matter of  		debate, but most everyone agrees that more mechanisms are needed for spreading  		the risks of catastrophic long-term care among large groups. The failure of our  		society to spread the financial risk of long-term care distinguishes it  		markedly from the way in which we finance acute care, where one person's risk  		of incurring a catastrophic event is spread across both users and non-users of  		services through various types of health insurance arrangements.</p>
<p>Why, in spite of consensus that we need more long-term care risk pools,  		haven't they developed, even among those who can well afford to buy risk  		protection? Analysts have identified a number of, obstacles that have impeded  		the development of a viable private long-term care insurance market:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A successful market requires educated consumers. Many elderly  			 persons are poorly informed about the risk of needing long-term care or still  			 mistakenly believe that it is covered by Medicare and Medigap insurance. Others  			 wait too long to plan for their long-term care needs and find themselves priced  			 out of the market or disqualified because they are too disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even for people who are knowledgeable, it is hard to know whether a  			 particular long-term care insurance product is a good value. The lack of  			 standard terminology, ambiguous terms governing eligibility for benefits,  			 uncertainty about the impact of inflation over a long period on the value of  			 benefits, and rapid changes in product lines, all make it difficult for  			 consumers to compare products or to know whether a particular product is worth  			 the premium cost.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note46">46</a></font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many believe that opportunities for the elderly to shelter or divest  			 their assets and still quality for Medicaid--thereby allowing them to receive  			 public coverage without true impoverishment--serves to reduce the demand for  			 private insurance. Why buy insurance if one can preserve assets and still  			 receive public coverage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inadequate enforcement of insurance regulations has contributed to a  			 lack of consumer confidence in the integrity of insurers and their products.  			 Congressional hearings and investigations by consumer organizations have  			 highlighted cases of fraudulent and misleading marketing practices, post-claims  			 underwriting, and a failure to pay legitimate claims. While most insurers  			 recognize the need for an adequate regulatory structure to protect consumers  			 and build confidence in the marketplace, consumer protections in many States  			 remain inadequate due to poor enforcement of regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is little actuarial data on which to project future long-term  			 care claims, and therefore to price products accurately. If insurers are forced  			 to raise premiums to meet future costs (i.e. if financial reserves are  			 insufficient to cover claims) many policyholders may be forced to lapse their  			 policies, leaving them with no coverage and nothing to show for their "savings"  			 (cumulative premium payments). Temporary reductions in income (e.g. after the  			 death of the spouse) may also force people to lapse policies, leaving them with  			 no coverage, and little possibility for buying another policy in the future (if  			 they are too old to afford the increased premium cost).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial solvency of the insurance industry in general is also  			 cause for concern. If private insurers become insolvent, some policyholders may  			 lose their protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is considerable debate about the proportion of the elderly who  			 can afford private insurance. A typical premium for a four-year nursing home  			 policy costs about $1,400 a year at age 65, and increases substantially as the  			 age at purchase increases. Estimates of the number of people who can afford to  			 purchase private insurance vary substantially. One estimate by Lewin-ICF  			 projects that about 37% of single persons and 59% of families could afford  			 these premium costs at age 65 if they were willing to forego all other types of  			 savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax status of private long-term care insurance premiums and  			 benefits remains uncertain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike health care, long-term care insurance lacks a significant  			 group market that would reduce premium costs and increase the affordability of  			 products, although there are indications that a small number of firms are  			 adding long-term care insurance (for both employees and their parents) as an  			 optional benefit.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note47">47</a></font> Until  			 companies are assured that contributions to long-term care premiums are a  			 deductible business expense, however, most are unlikely to contribute to  			 premium costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current regulatory requirements, which differ from State to State,  			 force insurers to tailor products to meet different regulatory perceptions of  			 what constitutes adequate consumer protection.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Should the Federal Government Help the Private Insurance  		Market?</h4>
<p>Given these obstacles to the development of a private long-term care  		insurance market, some policy analysts believe that government needs to take a  		more activist approach to stabilize and encourage this market. The 102nd  		Congress saw the introduction of numerous legislative proposals to change  		public policy in the private long-term care insurance market. These proposals  		generally fell into two categories: (1) legislation designed to stimulate the  		private long-term care insurance market; and (2) legislation that would  		establish a Federal role in the regulation of private long-term care insurance.  		For example, in August 1991, Senator Bentsen (D-TX) introduced the Private  		Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1991 (S. 1693), which propose to change Federal  		policy to both stimulate the private insurance market and regulate it more  		forcefully. The following sections discuss a variety of strategies that have  		been proposed to encourage the development of private risk pools for long-term  		care, and to ensure that sellers of private insurance policies adhere to  		certain public standards in how they conduct their business.</p>
<h4>Clarify Tax Treatment of Long-Term Care Insurance  		Premiums and Benefits</h4>
<p>At present, the Internal Revenue Code does not clearly specify whether  		premiums paid for private long-term care insurance, or benefits received, are  		subject to the same tax treatment as health and accident insurance. In other  		words, the tax code does not clarify whether individuals and employers can  		deduct long-term care insurance premiums from taxable income in the same manner  		in which they are allowed to deduct health insurance premiums, nor does it  		clarity whether benefits received, including indemnity payments, are exempt  		from taxable income.</p>
<p>Insurers and employers have been reluctant to offer long term care  		insurance in group markets, largely because of the uncertainty of the tax laws  		concerning long term care insurance reserves and the deductibility of premiums.  		The insurance industry believes that if long term care insurance was treated in  		the same manner as other accident and health insurance products, it would  		encourage employers to make long term care benefits more available to their  		employees as part of their compensation packages. The annual loss in tax  		expenditures which would result from these clarifications in the tax code are  		estimated at between $200 and $500 million annually (<a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#table6">Table  		6</a>).</p>
<h4>Incentives to Purchase Long-Term Care Insurance</h4>
<p>The Federal government could increase the affordability of private  		long-term care insurance by providing a tax credit to persons who purchased  		Federally-qualified policies. Such a tax credit could be structured to provide  		higher subsidies to elderly persons of low income and lower subsidies to  		persons with higher incomes. Supporters of public subsidies of private  		insurance feel that these strategies are more cost-effective than proposals to  		simply expand public coverage, since tax subsidies would leverage additional  		private dollars into the market. Also, they believe that limited public  		resources should be targeted towards helping individuals plan and protect  		against their future long-term care needs rather than simply providing public  		assistance after they have been impoverished by long-term care costs. Finally,  		they argue that the private insurance market will develop much more rapidly if  		public policies are enacted to help stimulate the market, particularly if they  		are accompanied by a Federal role in the improved regulation of the  		marketplace. For example, the enactment of a Federal tax credit would greatly  		increase awareness among the elderly about the need to plan for their future  		long-term care needs.</p>
<p>A principal argument against tax subsidies for private insurance is that  		they will divert public resources away from the truly poor elderly to more  		wealthy elderly persons. Why should public subsidies be provided to elderly  		persons who can well afford private insurance without subsidies? Tax subsidies  		will only be cost-effective if they truly stimulate the market beyond what  		would occur in the absence of subsidies (i.e., the number of people who would  		buy a policy with the subsidy who would otherwise not have bought policy).  		Further, they argue that there is little likelihood that these strategies will  		reduce Medicaid a expenditures either over the short or long term, because the  		vast majority of Medicaid costs are attributable to people who will never  		participate in the private market, with or without subsidies. If so, public  		resources will just end up being used to reduce the private costs of long-term  		care to elderly persons who would otherwise never receive public  		assistance.</p>

</tr></table><h4>Support Public-Private Partnerships for Long-Term  		Care</h4>
<p>Another strategy for encouraging private long-term care insurance is to  		support public-private partnerships for long-term care. This approach was  		initially developed under a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation demonstration  		program and is now being implemented in four States: California, Connecticut,  		Indiana and New York.</p>
<p>In December 1991, Connecticut was the first State to announce the  		implementation of such a program--The Connecticut Partnership for Long Term  		Care. Under the program, Connecticut is encouraging individuals to buy private  		insurance products by offering guaranteed asset protection under the State  		Medicaid program. For example, if someone buys a $50,000 private policy, and  		then later receives the full $50,000 in benefits, the State will also raise the  		Medicaid asset level by $50,000. Instead of having to "spend-down" to the usual  		Medicaid eligibility asset level of $1,600, the individual would become  		eligible for Medicaid once their assets reached $51,600.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note48">48</a></font> Without guaranteed asset protection,  		private insurance purchasers could still be impoverished by long-term care  		costs incurred after their insurance benefits ran out.</p>
<p>Since Connecticut only extends this protection to individuals who buy  		qualified products, the program has also allowed the state to have more than  		the usual regulatory input on the types of insurance products being sold in the  		marketplace, as well as marketing and sales practices. By encouraging the  		elderly to purchase long-term care insurance in this manner, the Connecticut  		Partnership for Long Term Care hopes to reduce the number of elderly persons  		who spend down to Medicaid. However, there is debate regarding whether the  		guaranteed asset protection that Connecticut is offering to insurance  		purchasers will end up costing or saving money over the long term.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, California, Indiana, and New York are  		planning to implement similar public-private partnerships. New York's program  		has an important variation of the guaranteed asset protection provision--in New  		York, if purchasers buy a policy that covers up to three years of nursing home  		care or six years of home care, the State will waive <b>all</b> asset  		requirements for Medicaid coverage once a policyholder has utilized their  		maximum benefit amount.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these public-private partnerships for  		long-term care require no change in Federal policy, since States can presently  		implement these types of programs under current Medicaid statute. However,  		neither the Federal government nor Congress has taken a position on this policy  		approach, to either encourage or discourage similar partnerships in other  		States. If it desired, Congress could certainly enact guaranteed asset  		protection provisions for private long-term care insurance purchasers into  		Federal law, requiring <b>all</b> States to adopt this approach, or it can keep  		a "hands off" approach and let States decides for themselves whether they would  		like to encourage the private long-term care insurance market in this  		manner.</p>
<h4>Federal Regulation of Private Long-Term Care  		Insurance</h4>
<p>The regulation of private long-term care insurance, like most insurance  		products, is presently the responsibility of State governments, through their  		50 State insurance commissions. State governments decide on minimum standards  		for insurance products, approve or disapprove specific products for sale in the  		marketplace, regulate premium increases, and monitor and enforce State laws and  		regulation regarding fraudulent or abusive marketing practices.</p>
<p>Many feel that the current system for regulating private long-term care  		insurance is inadequate, that too many purchasers of private products are being  		victimized by unscrupulous marketing and sales practices, and that many of the  		products being sold are of dubious value. These persons believe the Federal  		government should take a more forceful role in regulating this market, similar  		to the manner in which the Federal government regulates Medicare supplemental  		Insurance (Medi-gap).<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note49">49</a></font> A number  		of bills were introduced in the 102nd Congress which had the intent of  		protecting consumers through one or more of the following provisions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Require standardized use of terminology in policies approved for  			 sale;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish minimum Federal standards for <b>all</b> long-term care  			 insurance products or providing a seal of approval for only those products  			 which met Federal standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibit certain marketing, sales and underwriting practices,  			 limiting agent commissions, and setting minimum penalties for noncompliance  			 with these provisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify rights of purchasers to cancel policies, appeal claim  			 denials, and report abusive sales practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit annual or-aggregate premium increases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish solvency standards for the financial reserves of insurers,  			 specifying minimum loss ratios, and requiring insurers to submit periodic  			 financial reports on their long-term care insurance lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish minimum standards for State enforcement of long-term care  			 insurance regulations and/or providing technical assistance resources to States  			 to improve enforcement capacities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>While there is general agreement that there needs to be effective  		regulation of the private long-term care insurance market, there is  		disagreement on the degree of control which States and/or the Federal  		government should have. Proponents argue that strong government regulation is  		absolutely necessary to maintain consumer confidence in the market and to  		ensure that the products sold will provide real protection from future  		long-term care costs. Critics argue that government regulation will unduly  		stifle the market; lead to less flexibility, competition, and innovation; and  		result in pricing many middle-class elderly persons out of the market entirely  		by allowing only "Cadillac" policies to be sold.</p>
<h4>Implement Educational Campaigns</h4>
<p>The Federal government could also support educational programs to help  		elderly persons make more informed judgements about their purchases of private  		long-term care insurance. If consumers are more informed about what to look for  		in a long-term care insurance product, the private market will become more  		competitive in both quality and price. Given the intricacies involved in  		evaluating various features of insurance products, such as inflation protection  		and benefit criteria, many feel that a major educational campaign is absolutely  		essential in preventing fraudulent and abusive marketing practices in the  		industry.</p>
<p>Many also feel that the Federal government still needs to make it more  		explicit that Medicare <b>does not</b> cover custodial long-term care.  		Increased awareness among consumers about their future risk of needing  		long-term care would encourage them to prepare for that possibility. Further,  		many elderly may not be buying insurance because they are under the impression  		that even though the government doesn't provide coverage of long-term care now,  		that a national public insurance program will soon be enacted. Thus, although  		there is considerable disagreement in the policy arena about whether there  		<b>should</b> be a public insurance program for long-term care, a clearer  		articulation of <b>current</b> policy might help individuals decide whether  		buying an insurance product is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<h4>Other Private Market Strategies</h4>
<p>Insurance is not the only means used in the private market to protect  		individuals from the costs of long term care. A number of other options are  		also available. Other ways in which the Federal government could encourage the  		use of private resources include:</p>
<p><b>Home Equity Conversion (HEC) Plans</b>. Home equity conversion plans  		enable elderly homeowners to use their home equity assets without principal or  		interest payments until the house is sold or until they die. There are two  		distinct types of reverse mortgages: (1) fixed-term loans which generally make  		payments from 5 to 15 years; and (2) open-ended loans which make payments until  		death, institutionalization, or the resident moves out of the home. The  		government could expand current efforts to stimulate the market for HECs by  		guaranteeing an increased number of loans from banks or by sponsoring such  		programs directly.</p>
<p><b>Use of Pension Assets</b>. Almost 60 percent of workers over age 45  		have vested pensions and many of these workers have significant levels of  		vested funds available. Current law limits the use of these funds by workers.  		Allowing persons to use qualified retirement plans for the purchase of long  		term care insurance, both before and after retirement, in exchange for lower  		pension benefits in retirement may be a wise method for encouraging Americans  		to prepare for potential long term care needs in retirement. Workers would not  		have to sacrifice current consumption and they would gain the advantage of  		lower premium prices by purchasing insurance at earlier ages.</p>
<p><b>Tax Free Savings Vehicles</b>. Tax free savings vehicles similar to  		Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) could be permitted to accumulate funds to  		either pay directly for long term care services in retirement or to purchase  		long term care insurance.</p>
<p><b>Tax Free Accelerated Death Benefits</b>. Some insurers permit  		policyholders to convert existing universal or whole life insurance policies  		into long term care coverage through a lump sum payment of accelerated death  		benefits in the event of terminal illness, a specific disease, or confinement  		to a nursing home. Under current IRS regulations, these accelerated payments  		are potentially taxable, whereas if they were paid out upon death, amounts up  		to $600,000 would not be subject to tax. Congress or the IRS could specify that  		payments through such vehicles be treated the same as life insurance payments  		for tax purposes.</p>
<h4>Voluntary Public Insurance</h4>
<p>A long-term care financing strategy that has not received much attention  		in the policy arena is the idea of voluntary <b>public</b> insurance. Under  		this option, new Medicare enrollees would be offered the opportunity to  		purchase long-term care coverage from the Medicare program. In essence,  		Medicare would get into the long-term care insurance business, but only on a  		voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Under a voluntary public insurance program new Medicare beneficiaries,  		at the point they originally enroll in Medicare at age 65, would be offered the  		opportunity to purchase a relatively low-cost policy that would cover one year  		of nursing home care. Although this policy would not provide complete  		protection against the risk of long-term care, it would reduce the risk of a  		catastrophic loss, since it is estimated that less than one in four persons  		turning age 65 in 1990 will use more than one year of nursing home care during  		their remaining lifetimes.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note50">50</a></font></p>
<p>The public costs of a voluntary public insurance program would depend on  		the extent of coverage being "sold" in the program.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note51">51</a></font> If the policy objective was to sell risk  		protection to individuals who could not afford to buy protection in the private  		market, then a relatively low-cost package would be developed. For example, if  		persons bought $30,000 worth of coverage for long term care services (indexed  		to inflation) at age 65 and did not become eligible to receive benefits until  		they reached age 75, the initial monthly premium would be in the range of $60  		per month.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note52">52</a></font> Premium costs would  		be indexed to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, and there would be a  		$2,000 deductible, and a 20 percent copayment for all covered services. A  		beneficiary who exhausted his or her $30,000 in covered benefits would also be  		credited a $10,000 increase in the amount of protected assets for Medicaid  		eligibility (e.g., a single individual would qualify for Medicaid coverage when  		their countable assets reached $12,000 instead of $2,000).</p>
<p>If the private long-term care insurance market is unable to fulfill the  		needs of elderly persons with moderate incomes, a voluntary Medicare insurance  		program may be a worthy complement to the private market. Persons would not be  		provided complete protection, because the program would not pay for extended  		nursing home stays over one year, but the program would protect the financial  		well-being of a large segment of the elderly population who could not afford to  		buy private insurance. Premium subsidies could also be offered to lower income  		participants at a relatively low public cost. A voluntary public insurance  		program could also potentially include persons who could not otherwise buy  		insurance in the private market, such as persons who already had functional  		limitations at age 65, although this easing of underwriting criteria would  		raise premiums for non-disabled purchasers.<font><a href="analysis-long-term-care-reform-proposals.html#note53">53</a></font></p>
<p>Proponents of a voluntary public insurance program argue that the  		government would not be competing with the private market, only selling to  		individuals who could not participate in the private market. Persons with  		relatively small estates would be given the opportunity to reduce the risk that  		their entire estate would be wiped out by even a short nursing home stay.  		Linking the program with Medicare would also increase consumer confidence,  		minimize administrative costs, and ensure the long-run stability of the risk  		pool.</p>
<p>Detractors of a voluntary public insurance program, who are likely to  		include the private insurance industry, may claim that allowing the Federal  		government to sell long-term care insurance would introduce unfair competition  		into the market place. Private companies could not compete with the marketing  		advantages inherent in selling insurance as an additional Medicare benefit.</p>
<p>There may also be skepticism about whether the Federal government could  		operate a long-term care insurance benefit that was truly self-financed. Like  		Social Security and Medicare, would the Federal government truly put premium  		payments into "reserves" or would the program simply increase claims against  		future tax receipts? Second, critics may argue that political realities would  		create pressures on the government to hold down premium costs while raising  		benefit levels, such that the program would eventually become actuarily out of  		balance. Third, those who are opposed to public insurance for long-term care  		might be concerned that a "limited" and "voluntary" public insurance program  		would, over time, eventually be transformed into a comprehensive, mandatory  		insurance program.</p>
<h2><a name="partIII" id="partIII">PART III</a>. DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>Within the not too distant future, Americans are likely to make some  		important decisions about how we finance long-term care services for disabled  		elders. Dissatisfaction with current policy seems to be widespread and  		growing.</p>
<p>These will not be easy decisions to make. One fundamental decision is  		whether we should enact a public insurance program for long-term care. This  		will lead to a significant increase in public spending for health care services  		at a time when we are already dealing with exorbitant increases in public  		health care expenditures under Medicare and Medicaid. The enactment of a public  		insurance program for long-term care will require a substantial increase in tax  		revenue to finance the program, and many people are skeptical of the Federal  		government's ability to hold the lid on program outlays in order to keep the  		program in actuarial balance.</p>
<p>If we elect not to enact a comprehensive public insurance program, we  		will still face the issue of how to finance care for those elderly who cannot  		afford to purchase their own care, or buy risk protection in the private  		market. What level of public assistance do we consider fair public policy?  		Should the Federal government make this decision or should we let States decide  		what level of public assistance is appropriate and how resources should be  		allocated? And finally, should the public sector take a "hands off" approach to  		the development of the private long-term care insurance market, or should it  		take a more activist role in encouraging and regulating this market, including  		the support of public/private partnerships for long-term care financing?</p>
<p>The intention of this paper has been to identify a range of long-term  		care reform strategies that have surfaced in the policy debate, to sort them  		into a logical typology, and to present the major arguments that have been  		advanced in support and in opposition to each approach. Hopefully, this paper  		will make a contribution to the policy debate by more clearly articulating the  		choices that the American public, and its representatives in Congress, could  		make. The more informed we can make the debate, the better chance we have of  		ending up where we want to be, and not somewhere else.</p>

<p><a name="note12" id="note12">The</a> U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive  			 Health Care, more commonly known as The Pepper Commission, was mandated by  			 Congress in 1988 to recommend legislation that would ensure all Americans  			 coverage for health care and long-term care.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">Although</a> we fully recognize the private costs  			 of informally provided care, this discussion is limited to the cost burden of  			 formal (paid) services.</p>

<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">Medicare</a> Part A is financed as a social  			 insurance program. Medicare Part B, which covers physician and ancillary  			 services, is financed through premiums paid by beneficiaries and general  			 Federal tax revenues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">Of</a> course, individuals who never used public  			 long-term care would "lose" under this proposal because they would still have  			 to share in the cost of the program without receiving benefits (although they  			 would have the benefit of being insured). This would be the "insurance" feature  			 of a publicly-financed program. There would also be a wealth redistribution  			 effect, since individuals with estates of less than $200,000 would receive  			 benefits but not pay increased taxes.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">It</a> is reasonable to expect that even in a  			 public insurance program that there would still be individuals willing and able  			 to pay more than the public rate for better services and that providers would  			 seek out such patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note19" id="note19">It</a> is estimated that approximately 43 percent  			 of persons turning age 65 in 1990 will enter a nursing home at least once  			 before they die. This estimate, however, does not assume the enactment of a  			 social insurance program for nursing home coverage. Source: Kemper, P. and  			 Murtaugh, C.M.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note20" id="note20">This</a> argument is probably best articulated by  			 Gordon Trapnell:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The reality of public programs is that the contributions  				collected from current workers are used to pay for current beneficiaries. Any  				surplus of earmarked taxes (over benefits required) is simply used to reduce  				the general deficit of the federal government--in other words, to support other  				federal outlays. So there is no real investment of any given individual's  				contributions to pay for that person's retirement. Instead, each generation  				pays for the benefits of those already retired, gambling that future  				generations of workers will be equally generous to them when it comes their  				turn to retire. ... Therefore, the only realistic means of providing for the  				accumulation of the capital-based savings necessary for funding social  				insurance needs would appear to be private savings." Source: Trapnell, G. "Can  				We Afford Public Funding for Long-Term Care?" <i><b>Contingencies</b></i>,  				July/August 1990, pp. 39-46.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note21" id="note21">In</a> counterpoint of this argument, others point  			 out that if the public investments of excess contributions are invested  			 "wisely" (e.g. in education, research and development, infrastructure) that the  			 returns to the economy (and thus the ability to finance future benefits) could  			 be equal to those of private investment of long-term care savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note22" id="note22">In</a> counterpoint to this argument, some analysts  			 have proposed that public insurance benefits be paid in the form of an  			 indemnity benefit (voucher) tied to an individual's disability level.  			 Individual purchase decisions by long-term care consumers would then determine  			 the nature of the long-term care marketplace, rather than the decisions of  			 government policymakers.

<p><a name="note24" id="note24">"Revolving</a> door" coverage pertains to the  			 frequent discharge and readmission of nursing home patients by providers in  			 order to extend coverage of benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note25" id="note25">Any</a> significant expansion in public long-term  			 care benefits will increase the affordability of private insurance for  			 uncovered benefits by reducing the risk (cost) of uninsured events, unless  			 "moral hazard" effects increase total utilization by more than amount of care  			 covered under public expansions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note34" id="note34">To</a> avoid forcing recipients into "fire sales"  			 of their homes, States could allow recipients to retain Medicaid coverage while  			 making bona fide efforts to sell their homes at a fair market value.

<p><a name="note40" id="note40">Operationally,</a> the insurer would pay a provider  			 the full cost of an approved claim, and then bill the public program for the  			 subsidized share of the benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note41" id="note41">For</a> example, since public subsidies of covered  			 benefits would change in accordance with the income level of beneficiaries,  			 tracking systems would have to be put into place to track beneficiary income  			 levels on a periodic basis and make adjustments in subsidized benefits in  			 accordance with income fluctuations.</p>
