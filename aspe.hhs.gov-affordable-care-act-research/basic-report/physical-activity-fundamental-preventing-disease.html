<h2>Physical Activity Fundamental To Preventing Disease</h2>
<h4>June 20, 2002</h4>
<p>(<a href="../system/files/pdf/72836/physicalactivity.pdf">PDF Version</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>Regular physical activity, fitness, and exercise are critically  		important for the health and well being of people of all ages. Research has  		demonstrated that virtually all individuals can benefit from regular physical  		activity, whether they participate in vigorous exercise or some type of  		moderate health-enhancing physical activity. Even among frail and very old  		adults, mobility and functioning can be improved through physical  		activity.<sup>1</sup> Therefore, physical fitness should be a priority for  		Americans of all ages. </p>
<p>Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce the morbidity and  		mortality from many chronic diseases. Millions of Americans suffer from chronic  		illnesses that can be prevented or improved through regular physical activity:  		</p>
<ul><li>12.6 million people have coronary heart disease<sup>2</sup>;</li>
<li>1.1 million people suffer from a heart attack in a given  		  year<sup>2</sup>; </li>
<li>17 million people have diabetes; about 90% to 95% of cases are type 2  		  diabetes, which is associated with obesity and physical inactivity<sup>3</sup>;  		  approximately 16 million people have pre diabetes;</li>
<li>107,000 people are newly diagnosed with colon cancer each  		  year<sup>4,5</sup>; </li>
<li>300,000 people suffer from hip fractures each year<sup>6</sup>; </li>
<li>50 million people have high blood pressure<sup>2</sup>; and </li>
<li>Nearly 50 million adults (between the ages of 20 and 74), or 27% of  		  the adult population, are obese; overall more than 108 million adults, or 61%  		  of the adult population are either obese or overweight.<sup>7,8</sup></li>
</ul><p>In a 1993 study, 14 percent of all deaths in the United States were  		attributed to activity patterns and diet.<sup>9</sup> Another study linked  		sedentary lifestyles to 23 percent of deaths from major chronic  		diseases.<sup>10</sup> For example, physical activity has been shown to reduce  		the risk of developing or dying from heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, and  		high blood pressure. On average, people who are physically active outlive those  		who are inactive.<sup>11-16</sup></p>
<p>Despite the well-known benefits of physical activity, most adults and  		many children lead a relatively sedentary lifestyle and are not active enough  		to achieve these health benefits. A sedentary lifestyle is defined as engaging  		in no leisure-time physical activity (exercises, sports, physically active  		hobbies) in a two-week period. Data from the National Health Interview Survey  		shows that in 1997-98 nearly four in 10 (38.3 percent) adults reported no  		participation in leisure- time physical activity.<sup>17</sup></p>

Fifty-four percent of men and 66 percent of women age 75 and older engage in no  		leisure-time physical activity.<sup>17 </sup>In general, African American older  		adults are less active than white older adults. In the mid 1990's, 37 percent  		of white men age 75 and older reported no leisure-time physical activity,  		compared to 59 percent of African American men age 75 and older; 47 percent of  		white women age 75 and older reported no leisure-time physical activity,  		compared to 60 percent of African American women age 75 and older.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>More than one-third of young people in grades 9-12 do not regularly  		engage in vigorous physical activity. Furthermore, 43 percent of students in  		grades 9-12 watch television more than two hours per day.<sup>19 </sup>Physical  		activity declines dramatically over the course of adolescence, and girls are  		significantly less likely than boys to participate regularly in vigorous  		physical activity. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>Economic Consequences of Inactivity</b> </p>
<p>Physical inactivity and its associated health problems have substantial  		economic consequences for the U.S. health care system. In the long run,  		physical inactivity threatens to reverse the decades-long progress that has  		been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with many chronic  		conditions such as cardiovascular disease. A physically inactive population is  		at both medical and financial risk for many chronic diseases and conditions  		including heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, and  		osteoporosis. </p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of chronic medical conditions and diseases  		related to physical inactivity are associated with two types of costs. First,  		there are health care costs for preventative, diagnostic, and treatment  		services related to these chronic conditions. These costs may include  		expenditures for physician visits, pharmaceuticals, ambulance services,  		rehabilitation services and hospital and nursing home care. In addition, there  		are other costs associated with the value of lost wages by people unable to  		work because of illness and disability, as well as the value of future earnings  		lost by premature death. In 2000, the total cost of overweight and obesity was  		estimated to be $117 billion.<sup>7</sup> In addition, the total estimated cost  		from chronic diseases is substantial. </p>

<p>Individuals suffering from chronic diseases bear a substantial portion  		of these medical costs. A recent study demonstrated that obese individuals  		spend approximately 36 percent more than the general population on health  		services and 77 percent more on medications.<sup>20</sup> Furthermore, the  		study found that the effects of obesity on health spending were significantly  		larger than effects of current or past smoking. </p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid programs currently spend $84 billion annually  		on five major chronic conditions that could be significantly improved by  		increased physical activity, specifically diabetes, heart disease, depression,  		cancer, and arthritis. Medicare spent $10.4 billion on diabetes treatment and  		services in 2000 and is estimated to spend $12.7 billion in 2004. </p>

</tr></table><p>Since regular physical activity helps prevent disease and promote  		health, it may actually decrease health care costs. A study performed by  		researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that  		physically active people had, on average, lower annual direct medical costs  		than did inactive people. The same study estimated that increasing regular  		moderate physical activity among the more than 88 million inactive Americans  		over the age of 15 years might reduce the annual national direct medical costs  		by as much as $76.6 billion in 2000 dollars.<sup>21</sup> Further, it found  		that physically active people had fewer hospital stays and physician visits and  		used less medication than physically inactive people. The cost savings were  		consistent for men and women, for those with and without physical limitations,  		and even for smokers and nonsmokers. In this study, the biggest difference in  		direct medical costs was among women 55 and older, supporting the belief that  		the potential gain associated with physical activity is especially high for  		older women. The researchers concluded that adoption of a population-wide  		physical activity strategy might produce health care cost savings among most  		adult age groups. </p>
<p>Employers can benefit too. Workplace physical activity programs can  		reduce short-term sick leave by six to 32 percent, reduce health care costs by  		20 to 55 percent, and increase productivity by 2 to 52 percent. <sup>22</sup>  		In 1998, 93 percent of employers had programs that fostered employee health, up  		from 76 percent in 1992, according to Hewitt Associates. Such  		wellness programs typically offer help in smoking cessation,  		managing stress, prenatal care, nutrition, and fitness.<sup>23 </sup></p>
<p><b>Physical Activity and Good Physical Health </b></p>
<p>Participation in regular physical activity at least 30 minutes of  		moderate activity on at least five days per week, or 20 minutes of vigorous  		physical activity at least three times per weekis critical to sustaining  		good health. Youth should strive for at least one hour of exercise a day.  		Regular physical activity has beneficial effects on most (if not all) organ  		systems, and consequently it helps to prevent a broad range of health problems  		and diseases. People of all ages, both male and female, derive substantial  		health benefits from physical activity. </p>
<p>Regular physical activity reduces the risk of developing or dying from  		some of the leading causes of illness in the United States. Regular physical  		activity improves health in the following ways<sup>22</sup>: </p>
<ul><li>Reduces the risk of dying prematurely from heart disease and other  		  conditions;</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of developing diabetes; </li>
<li>Reduces the risk of developing high blood pressure; </li>
<li>Reduces blood pressure in people who already have high blood  		  pressure;</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of developing colon and breast  		  cancer<sup>5</sup>;</li>
<li>Helps to maintain a healthy weight;</li>
<li>Helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints; </li>
<li>Helps older adults to become stronger and better able to move about  		  without falling; </li>
<li>Reduces feelings of depression and anxiety; and </li>
<li>Promotes psychological well-being. </li>
</ul><p>Regular physical activity is associated with lower mortality rates for  		both older and younger adults.<sup>22</sup> Even those who are moderately  		active on a regular basis have lower mortality rates than those who are least  		active. Regular physical activity leads to cardiovascular fitness, which  		decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in general and coronary  		artery disease mortality in particular. High blood pressure is a major  		underlying cause of cardiovascular complications and mortality. Regular  		physical activity can prevent or delay the development of high blood pressure,  		and reduces blood pressure in persons with hypertension. </p>
<p>Regular physical activity is also important for maintaining muscle  		strength, joint structure, joint functioning, and bone health.<sup>22</sup>  		Weight-bearing physical activity is essential for normal skeletal development  		during childhood and adolescence and for achieving and maintaining peak bone  		mass in young adults. Among post-menopausal women, exercise, especially muscle  		strengthening (resistance) activity, may protect against the rapid decline in  		bone mass. However, data on the effects of exercise on post-menopausal bone  		loss are not clear-cut and the timing of the intervention (e.g., stage of  		menopausal transition) can influence the response. Regardless, physical  		activity including muscle-strengthening exercise appears to protect against  		falling and fractures among the elderly, probably by increasing muscle strength  		and balance.<sup>22 </sup>In addition, physical activity may be beneficial for  		many people with arthritis. </p>
<p>Regular physical activity can help improve the lives of young people  		beyond its effects on physical health. Although research has not been conducted  		to conclusively demonstrate a direct link between physical activity and  		improved academic performance, such a link might be expected. Studies have  		found participation in physical activity increases adolescents  		self-esteem and reduces anxiety and stress.<sup>22</sup> Through its effects on  		mental health, physical activity may help increase students capacity for  		learning. One study found that spending more time in physical education did not  		have harmful effects on the standardized academic achievement test scores of  		elementary school students; in fact, there was some evidence that participation  		in a two-year health-related physical education program had several significant  		favorable effects on academic achievement.<sup>24 </sup></p>
<p>Participation in physical activity and sports can promote social  		well-being, as well as good physical and mental health, among young people.  		Research has shown that students who participate in interscholastic sports are  		less likely to be regular and heavy smokers or use drugs<sup>25</sup>, and are  		more likely to stay in school and have good conduct and high academic  		achievement.<sup>26</sup> Sports and physical activity programs can introduce  		young people to skills such as teamwork, self-discipline, sportsmanship,  		leadership, and socialization. Lack of recreational activity, on the other  		hand, may contribute to making young people more vulnerable to gangs, drugs, or  		violence. </p>
<p><b>Physical Activity and Good Mental Health </b></p>
<p>Regular physical activity reduces morbidity and mortality from mental  		health disorders.<sup>27</sup> Mental health disorders pose a significant  		public health burden in the United States and they are a major cause of  		hospitalization and disability. Mental health disorders cost approximately $148  		billion per year.<sup>22</sup> Potentially, increasing physical activity levels  		in Americans could substantially reduce medical expenditures for mental health  		conditions. </p>
<p>In adults with affective disorders, physical activity has a beneficial  		effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety.<sup>27 </sup>Animal research  		suggests that exercise may stimulate the growth of new brain cells that enhance  		memory and learningtwo functions hampered by depression. Clinical studies  		have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of exercise as a treatment for  		depression in older men and women. Currently, National Institute of Mental  		Health (NIMH) investigators are conducting research comparing the effectiveness  		of home-based and supervised aerobic exercise to the use of antidepressants in  		relieving depression in these groups, and reducing relapse rates. Other NIMH  		researchers are studying whether greater exercise levels result in more symptom  		improvement. Regular physical activity also appears to enhance well-being. </p>
<p>The preventive effects of physical activity on mental disorders are less  		well studied. Some studies suggest physical activity prevents depressive  		illness. Future research will clarify the extent to which physical activity may  		actually protect against the development of depression. </p>
<p>Regular physical activity may also reduce risk of cognitive decline in  		older adults, though more research is needed to clarify the mechanism of this  		possible effect. Among people who suffer from mental illness, physical activity  		appears to improve the ability to perform activities of daily  		living.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p><b>Physical Activity (Along with a Nutritious Diet) is Key to  		Maintaining Energy Balance and a Healthy Weight </b></p>
<p>Regular physical activity along with a nutritious diet is key to  		maintaining a healthy weight. In order to maintain a healthy weight, there must  		be a balance between calories consumed and calories expended through metabolic  		and physical activity. Although overweight and obesity are caused by many  		factors, in most individuals, weight gain results from a combination of excess  		calorie consumption and inadequate physical activity. </p>
<p>Even though a large portion of a persons total caloric requirement  		is used for basal metabolism and processing food, an individuals various  		physical activities may account for as much as 15 to 40 percent of the calories  		he or she burns each day. While vigorous exercise uses calories at a higher  		rate, any physical activity will burn calories. For example, a 140-pound person  		can burn 175 calories in 30 minutes of moderate bicycling, and 322 calories in  		30 minutes of moderate jogging. The same person can also burn 105 calories by  		vacuuming or raking leaves for the same amount of time. </p>
<p><b>The Epidemic of Overweight and Obesity </b></p>
<p>As a result of lifestyle and dietary changes, overweight and obesity  		have reached epidemic proportions in the United States. The Body Mass Index  		(BMI) is the most commonly used measure to define overweight and obesity. BMI  		is a measure of weight in relation to height. BMI is calculated as weight in  		pounds divided by the square of the height in inches, multiplied by 703. </p>
<p>According to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Guidelines,  		overweight in adults is defined as a BMI between 25 lbs/in<sup>2</sup> to 29.9  		lbs/in<sup>2</sup>; and obesity in adults is identified by a BMI of 30  		lbs/in<sup>2</sup> or greater.<sup>28</sup> These definitions are based on  		evidence that suggests that health risks are greater at or above a BMI of 25  		lbs/in<sup>2</sup> compared to those at a BMI below that level. The risk of  		premature death increases with an increasing BMI. This increase in mortality  		tends to be modest until a BMI of 30 lbs/in<sup>2</sup> is reached. </p>

In 1999, an estimated 61 percent of adults in the U.S. were  		overweight or obese; this contrasts with the late 1970s, when an estimated 47  		percent of adults were overweight or obese.<sup>7</sup> Figure 9 demonstrates  		the increasing prevalence of obesity among adults throughout the United States.  		</p>

For non-Hispanic men, the prevalence of overweight and  		obesity among whites is slightly greater than among blacks. </p>

Men are about equally likely to be obese whether they are in a low  		or high socioeconomic group. </p>
<p>The overweight and obesity epidemic is not limited to adults. What is  		particularly alarming is that the percentage of young people who are overweight  		has almost doubled in the last 20 years for children aged 6-11 and almost  		tripled for adolescents aged 12-19. In children and adolescents, overweight has  		been defined as a sex- and age- specific BMI at or above the 95<sup>th</sup>  		percentile for a reference population, based on Centers for Disease Control and  		Prevention (CDC) growth charts </p>

<p>Epidemiological studies show an increase in mortality associated with  		overweight and obesity. Approximately 300,000 deaths a year in this country are  		currently associated with overweight and obesity.<sup>29</sup> Morbidity from  		obesity may be as great as from poverty, smoking, or problem  		drinking.<sup>20</sup> Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased  		risk for developing various medical conditions including cardiovascular  		disease, certain cancers (endometrial, colon, postmenopausal breast, kidney,  		and esophageal)<sup>5</sup>, high blood pressure, arthritis-related  		disabilities and type 2 diabetes.<sup>7</sup></p>

</tr></table><p>It is also important for individuals who are currently at a healthy  		weight to strive to maintain it since both modest and large weight gains are  		associated with significantly increased risk of disease. For example, a weight  		gain of 11 to 18 pounds increases a persons risk for developing type 2  		diabetes to twice that of individuals who have not gained weight, while those  		who gain 44 pounds or more have four times the risk of type 2  		diabetes.<sup>30</sup></p>
<p>Recent research studies have shown that a gain of 10 to 20 pounds  		resulted in an increased risk of coronary heart disease (which can result in  		nonfatal heart attacks and death) of 1.25 times in women<sup>31</sup> and 1.6  		times in men.<sup>32 </sup>In these studies, weight increases of 22 pounds in  		men and 44 pounds in women resulted in a increased coronary heart disease risk  		of 1.75 and 2.65, respectively. In one study among women with a BMI of 34 or  		greater, the risk of developing endometrial cancer was increased by more than 6  		times.<sup>33</sup> Overweight and obesity are also known to exacerbate many  		chronic conditions such as hypertension and elevated cholesterol. Overweight  		and obese individuals also may suffer from social stigmatization,  		discrimination, and poor body image. </p>
<p>Although obesity-associated morbidities occur most frequently in adults,  		important consequences of excess weight as well as antecedents of adult disease  		occur in overweight children and adolescents. Overweight children and  		adolescents are more likely to become overweight or obese adults. As the  		prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in children and adolescents,  		type 2 diabetes, high blood lipids, and hypertension as well as early  		maturation and orthopedic problems are occurring with increased frequency. A  		common consequence of childhood overweight is psychosocialspecifically  		discrimination.<sup>34</sup></p>
<p><b>Call to Action </b></p>
<p>Because physical inactivity is a risk factor for many diseases and  		conditions, making physical activity an integral part of daily life is crucial.  		Physical activity need not be strenuous to be beneficial. People of all ages  		benefit from moderate physical activity, such as 30 minutes of walking five or  		more times a week. In addition, physical activity does not need to be sustained  		for long periods of time in order to provide health benefits. Repeated shorter  		bursts of moderate-intensity activity also yield health benefits. In other  		words, walking in two 15-minute segments or three 10-minute segments is  		beneficial. </p>
<p>This report makes clear the pressing need to encourage a more active  		lifestyle among the American people. Clearly, the goal of a more active  		population will be a challenge, requiring a commitment to change on the part of  		individuals, families, work places, and communities. Both the public and  		private sectors will need to band together to promote more healthy habits for  		those of all ages.<sup>7</sup> Encouraging more activity can be as simple as  		establishing walking programs at schools, worksites and in the community. Some  		communities have an existing infrastructure that supports physical activity,  		such as sidewalks and bicycle trails, and work sites, schools, and shopping  		areas in close proximity to residential areas. In many other areas, such  		community amenities need to be developed to foster walking, cycling, and other  		types of exercise as a regular part of daily activity. Schools provide many  		opportunities to engage children in physical activity as well as healthy  		eating. For adults, worksites provide opportunities to reinforce the adoption  		and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Perhaps the most important  		change, however, is at the individual and family level. Each person must  		understand the value of physical activity for his or her health and well-being  		and commit to a lifestyle that is truly active. </p>
