</dl><h2><a name="sectionI" id="sectionI">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In 1992, The Academy published "Building Assisted Living For The Elderly  		Into Public Policy: A Guide For States" to help state policy makers examine an  		emerging concept for providing residential, home-like settings for elders. The  		Guide examined the confusion surrounding the use of the term "assisted living"  		and the principles that are associated with assisted living as distinct from  		board and care, residential care, personal care homes and other terms. The  		Guide also described policy initiatives in five states: <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NY">New  		York</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a>, and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a> and the  		financing sources for housing construction and operation and services. Since  		1992, a number of states have issued regulations, are presently developing  		regulations or have initiated a study process to consider assisted living as a  		separate category. As the trend continues, the use of the term assisted living  		still brings confusion and variations in definition and meaning among states.  		</p>
<p>This report is intended to update information provided in the original  		guide and to describe policies in all states that can be identified as  		licensing or providing assisted living. In addition, it seeks to differentiate  		assisted living from board and care and similar types of care. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionI1" id="sectionI1">State Surveys</a></h3>
<p>In July 1994, the Academy conducted two brief surveys to identify state  		activity in assisted living. The first survey focused on licensing and service  		delivery while the second dealt with housing financing. The regulation/services  		survey was designed to identify states that have promulgated or are developing  		or considering assisted living policies or regulations. The survey was sent to  		the Health, Aging and Medicaid Agencies in each state. States were asked to  		submit copies of their most recent statutes, regulations, or draft  		regulations/policies. The survey was intended to gather initial information and  		to identify states that would receive follow up calls to learn more about the  		specifics of their program. </p>
<p>The survey did not offer a definition of assisted living. Instead, the  		survey sought to identify states that indicated, using their own frame of  		reference, that they have an assisted living program or licensure category.  		Eighty six respondents from 48 states answered the survey: Aging, 32; Medicaid,  		32; Health, 22. Responses to the question "does your state have an assisted  		living model, program or category" sometimes brought conflicting answers from  		respondents in the same state. The conflict resulted from varying perceptions  		about the question and possibly a lack of knowledge about programs outside  		their own agency. The question was intentionally worded to gather information  		about how state agency staff thought assisted living is defined. Follow up  		calls were made to states that responded positively to the question. Many  		people view the term assisted living generically and considered residential  		care, personal care homes and other variations as assisted living. Others  		indicated that they needed a definition before they could answer. </p>
<p>Based on follow up interviews and analysis of regulations and  		legislation, 19 states either have legislation authorizing assisted living, a  		licensure category, or an assisted living service program. Reports and  		recommendations have been issued in three states (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ID">Idaho</a>,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#IN">Indiana</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NC">North Carolina</a></b>).  		Legislation that would repeal or modify existing program authority is pending  		in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a> (modify), <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NY">New York</a> (repeal)  		and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a> (repeal and substitute a service program for a  		licensure category)</b>, while legislation to establish assisted living  		authority is pending in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#HI">Hawaii</a>, Montana and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WI">Wisconsin</a></b>. Finally, interagency work groups or task forces  		are operating in five states to develop policy <b>(Illinois, Louisiana,  		Michigan, Oklahoma and Vermont)</b>. As this report was finished, two states,  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#UT">Utah</a></b>, were finalizing  		their regulations. </p>
<p>Because of the overlap between assisted living and other forms of  		supportive housing, we asked respondents if the state's assisted living program  		or category differed from board and care or equivalent programs (personal care  		homes, rest homes, residential care facilities, etc.).<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> An analysis of state policies found that  		assisted living and board and care models were the same in five states (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AL">Alabama</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#RI">Rhode Island</a>, South Dakota,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WY">Wyoming</a></b>). </p>
<p>The second survey was mailed to Housing Finance Agencies and asked if  		the state HFA had financed assisted living projects in the last five years or,  		if not, whether the HFA had plans to do so in the future. The response rate was  		much lower -- only 15 states. Nine states indicated that they provided  		financing for assisted living or planned to do so and 6 state HFAs said they  		did not. Confusion about the definition may be present here as well since  		several of the state answering affirmatively do not have an assisted living  		category or program. However, HFAs provide financing for private sector  		facilities that either are not required to be licensed or use the term  		"assisted living" rather than the term specified as a licensure category. The  		survey also asked HFAs to identify the sources of financing (tax exempt bonds,  		tax credits, HUD loans). Analysis of the HFA survey is continuing. </p>
<h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. FINDINGS</a></h2>
<p>In order to bridge the gap between states which explicitly use the term  		"assisted living" and states that do not, we have developed a working framework  		which delineates several components found in state policy that may be used to  		differentiate assisted living from board and care models. We are developing a  		matrix that identifies the components in each state. As a result, some states  		that use the term assisted living may not in fact meet the framework (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AL">Alabama</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#RI">Rhode Island</a>, South Dakota,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WY">Wyoming</a></b>) and others that do not use the term may be  		included (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b>). <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a> uses the  		term adult congregate living facility and extended congregate care although  		legislation is pending that would change the term to assisted living. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionII1" id="sectionII1">Defining Assisted Living</a></h3>
<p>In developing our approach to assisted living, we struggled with a  		starting point. No one in the long term care field enters a discussion about  		assisted living without a frame of reference. For many, it's the nursing home  		and for others a housing setting. We pictured three buildings standing side by  		side, a single family home, an apartment building and an assisted living site  		(we prefer to avoid using the term "facility" but have been unable to avoid  		it). Within each building, an individual with chronic but stable health  		conditions and dependencies in activities of daily living lives. The person  		living in their own home can receive skilled nursing care, personal care and a  		host of other services. Relatives can perform tasks that only a licensed  		professional can perform if the caregiver were not related. Except in relation  		to local building codes, government agencies do not consider the condition of  		the structure. Subject to a rental agreement, a similar person living in an  		elderly housing project can receive a full range of ADL and nursing services  		from certified home health agencies and other community providers. If the  		housing entity provides or arranges for services, and the cost of the service  		is included in the rent, a license would be needed in most states. For reasons  		related to the preferences of the housing owner or management company, rental  		agreements may not allow someone who is incontinent, forgetful or exhibits  		aggressive behaviors to reside in the project. However, these conditions are  		not a function of the government's regulation of the building. </p>
<p>When the person moves from their single family home or apartment to a  		building in which all the residents receive services, a totally different  		government perspective and regulatory requirements take over. Until the advent  		of assisted living, policy makers and regulators tended to focus not only on  		the organization providing the actual service and the credentials of the direct  		care staff, but on the building itself apart from the application of local and  		state building and fire codes. While a person may live at home with skilled  		nursing needs, extensive ADL needs and unstable medical conditions, regulations  		often will not allow the same person to receive care in other settings. In  		apartments, assisted living and other settings, government regulation focuses  		on both the person's conditions and service needs, the source of care and the  		source of payment. Licensed facilities may be prevented from providing skilled  		nursing services but the resident may receive the very same care from an  		outside agency! These incongruities highlight the contradictions of many  		regulatory policies and provide a sound basis for re-examining how states  		license, regulate and finance long term care for their citizens. </p>
<p>This perspective leads to consideration of assisted living as a service,  		rather than service in a particular setting, but, if so, how then would it  		differ from home care or in-home services? The value of the assisted living  		trend is its emphasis on two factors: residential settings, which raises a  		debate over whether multiple occupancy bedrooms and shared baths should be  		considered residential, and autonomy, dignity, privacy, independence and  		choice. </p>
<p>We have approached assisted living as a home setting in which services  		are provided. Boundaries can be drawn around the conditions and needs that can  		be met -- how much skilled nursing can be provided, what types of health  		conditions can be treated -- the types of living environments or structures  		which define the setting, and the philosophy or goals that differentiate  		assisted living from other models of care. We have not developed a definition,  		per se, but instead have identified factors which we believe constitute  		assisted living in state models. </p>
<p>Developing a definition that would be accepted nationally is unlikely.  		States have historically retained the authority to license service providers  		and, despite similarities, each state has developed definitions and  		requirements to meet their own circumstances. Unlike its approach to nursing  		homes, the federal government has not developed a strict definition of assisted  		living since it is only reimbursed as a Medicaid waiver service. </p>
<p>A range of definitions have been developed by national associations,  		states and the US Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA). The definitions  		have different sources and purposes. Definitions can be found in state law,  		regulations, Medicaid waiver programs and even provider contracts. They can be  		used to set licensure standards and requirements and to describe purchasing  		expectations. A few states use their definition to set purchasing standards  		(<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b>) for the services  		that will be reimbursed and they also set requirements for the housing in which  		people who receive such services can reside. This approach does not affect the  		state's licensure categories and instead sets parameters that differentiate  		among providers in a licensure category. </p>
<p>Policy makers, providers and consumers would benefit from a commonly  		understood meaning for the term "assisted living." Regulations is five states  		(<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AL">Alabama</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#RI">Rhode Island</a>, South Dakota,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WY">Wyoming</a></b>) use the term for  		their licensure category but it used to describe a board and care model. Some  		states use the board and care regulations as the basis of their assisted living  		program and require higher standards for the living unit or allow a higher  		level of services to be provided to residents who need some skilled services.  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b> does not use the term but differentiates  		Extended Congregate Care from the basic level of service in adult care homes.  		Assisted living providers in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a></b> must have a  		boarding home license but must offer apartment style units to participate in  		the state's program. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a>'s</b> draft regulations use the  		term assisted living but define it as a service which essentially renames  		existing programs. </p>
<p>Definitions from the Assisted Living Facilities Association of America  		and the American Seniors Housing Association (ASHA) emphasize the service focus  		and the resident's prominent role. Definitions or frameworks developed by  		associations usually do not deal with or define the nature of the housing  		component. The ASHA definition makes reference to residential surroundings but  		does not describe what constitutes residential surroundings. The National  		Association of Residential Care Facilities considers that the definition of  		assisted living is interchangeable with residential care, foster homes, board  		and care homes, sheltered care homes and other terms. They believe that board  		and care carries a negative meaning and assisted living has emerged as a market  		and public relations oriented strategy. </p>
<p>The Health Care Financing Administration's definition serves a narrower  		purpose than a state licensing requirement. It was developed to help states  		define the services which are reimbursed through the Medicaid waiver program.  		</p>
<h4>A potential paradigm ...</h4>
<p>After examining definitions and models from these sources, we have offer  		a path for arriving at a standard understanding of assisted living. Consumers,  		advocates and policy makers feel the term "facility" conveys an institutional  		environment that is contrary to the goals of their program. They consider  		assisted living as someone's home with all the meaning "home" implies (bedroom,  		living room, bathroom, kitchen, control, belongings). Yet referring to assisted  		living as "home" is also confusing. The recently passed statute in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a></b> uses the term "assisted living residence."  		Perhaps we need to create a term that has no other meaning. We would give it  		meaning for at least a segment of the assisted living market or in states that  		have defined assisted living as a purpose-built building with apartments.  		Otherwise tenants in conventional elderly housing buildings would refer to the  		building differently depending upon whether they were independent and did not  		receive any service or if they participated in the state's assisted living  		program. </p>
<p>As the field evolves, it is likely that we may need several terms that  		differentiate the settings in which assisted living is found. We may need one  		term for apartment style buildings in which all residents receive services and  		have sought tenancy in the building because of their service needs. We may need  		another term to describe services provided to some but not all residents in  		elderly housing buildings. This housing with supportive services model meets  		the needs of people as they age in place. Still another term is needed to  		describe modifications to the existing or historical board and care licensure  		category of facilities as they serve residents with higher needs for personal  		care and routine nursing services. Models that identify assisted living as a  		service that can be provided in a range of residential/institutional settings  		create a further conflict. Assisted living, as it first emerged in state  		policy, conveyed a combination of a service package (emphasizing personal care  		and nursing services) provided in a home-like setting. Many of the settings  		were covered by the state's board and care license but offered an environment  		that exceeded minimum standards and emphasized privacy. Yet the emphasis on  		apartment style units conflicts with emerging concepts concerning models to  		serve people with Alzheimers' Disease assisted living. Studies have found that  		29% to 42% of the residents in assisted living settings have cognitive  		impairments.<font><sup><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#note2">2</a></sup></font> Hyde  		contends that "best practices" in dementia care show that shared rather than  		private units are more successful serving people with dementia. </p>
<p>An examination and analysis of licensure categories alone is not  		sufficient to develop a clearer understanding of assisted living since several  		states have defined assisted living through their service systems, most notably  		the Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver program. These efforts in  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b> have led to  		adoption of apartment criteria for participants to qualify to receive assisted  		living services under a waiver and for providers to participate in the program.  		Recipients in conventional elderly housing projects can receive similar  		services in their apartment and many waivers allow personal care, home health  		aide and skilled services to be delivered to residents in licensed board and  		care facilities. </p>
<p>Based on the patterns of state policy, it may be possible to  		differentiate services from the setting in which services are received. The  		service component can be called "in-home" services which recognizes that  		wherever a person lives is their home although some might not consider their  		setting their "home" but rather a place they have to live. If services are  		defined by a separate term, then assisted living can refer to a building with  		apartment-like settings, in which all residents live in order to take advantage  		of the services which are provided. This approach allows settings which are  		licensed as board and care but do not provide single occupancy units to retain  		a separate and distinct meaning. Buildings currently licensed as board and care  		which do offer single occupancy units would be licensed or certified under the  		new category of assisted living. Apartments in elderly housing projects would  		not be called assisted living. </p>
<p>While this approach may appeal to those who are not involved in a  		state's program or who do not operate assisted living or board and care  		facilities, it is unlikely that any state would modify their program after many  		months, often several years, of work, negotiation and compromise to develop  		their definition or program. As such, this section is perhaps an academic  		exercise that may have relevance to states that are now defining their program  		and it may help people in states with an existing assisted living definition or  		program place their policy in the broader context of assisted living and  		identify similarities and differences with other models. </p>
<p>State flexibility means variation in approach. People who prefer a  		standard definition will be satisfied if the final definition is consistent  		with <i>their</i> approach. The other alternative is to develop a definition  		that is broad, flexible and encompasses a range of models such as the ALFAA  		definition. The quest to develop a standard definition becomes a circular  		exercise guaranteed to end in frustration! For policy makers who seek a  		standard, acceptable definition, readily understood by all, the need will pass  		once your state has arrived at its own definition. Unfortunately, based on the  		experience of states that have persevered through the process, it is time  		consuming, labor intensive, requires skills in listening, negotiation and  		compromise. A matrix which summarizes the components we have identified in  		state programs and policies will be included in the next report. </p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. COMPARING STATE MODELS</a></h2>
<p>States have defined assisted living as a program approach in a new model  		of housing and services (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AZ">Arizona</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a>,  		and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a></b>), a service in an apartment setting (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ND">North  		Dakota</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WI">Wisconsin</a> (draft)</b>), and a service model in  		multiple settings (<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AK">Alaska</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a>,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MD">Maryland</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New  		Jersey</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#UT">Utah</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b>). In <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New Jersey</a></b>, assisted  		living services can be provided to residents in personal care homes, free  		standing assisted living facilities or conventional elderly housing  		developments. Extended congregate care can be provided in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b> to residents in a wide range of settings: any  		building or buildings, section of a building, or distinct part of a building,  		residence, private home, boarding home, home for the aged, or other place... "  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a></b> licenses assisted living as a service but  		limits its provision to managed residential communities which can be  		purpose-built facilities or conventional elderly housing. The pending  		definition in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a></b> proposes a definition of "assisted  		living services provider" which means a provider of assisted living services  		licensed either as a residential care facility, certified as congregate housing  		services or licensed as a home health agency. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a>'s</b>  		statute (Chapter 661 of the Acts of 1994) requires that the definition include  		a range of services from in-home assistance to facility based care which varies  		the levels of regulation depending upon the level of care provided. </p>
<p>State definitions use a number of common terms to define their program  		although many key program requirements are found elsewhere in regulations or  		statute. For example, the definition of the housing unit is not contained in  		the definition of assisted living in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a>,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a> or <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a></b> while it is  		included in the definition used by <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New Jersey</a></b> and  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a></b>. </p>
<p>A few states have separated licensing of the housing from service  		provision. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a>,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ND">North Dakota</a></b> have  		created requirements for the provision of services and do not add new licensing  		requirements as part of the assisted living designation. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WI">Wisconsin</a> (draft)</b>  		provide for certification rather than licensing of assisted living facilities.  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a></b> defines assisted living as a service through  		their Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs and  		requires that units must consist of individual apartments. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b>, which has also created assisted living through a  		Medicaid HCBS waiver, allows assisted living to be provided in apartments and  		non-apartment settings. </p>
<p>A proposal in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NC">North Carolina</a></b> takes a variation  		of the same approach. This proposal addresses the residences in which services  		are provided. It would define assisted living residences as "any group housing  		and service program for two or more unrelated adults, <i>by whatever name it is  		called</i>, which makes available, at a minimum, one meal a day and  		housekeeping services and provides personal care services directly or through a  		formal written agreement with one or more licensed home care agencies." The  		draft policy does not affect the unit requirements and instead allows personal  		care and nursing services "to the extent allowed under Medicare home health  		regulations" to be delivered in two settings multi-unit independent housing and  		adult care homes. Multi-unit independent housing sites can arrange for the  		delivery of services by a licensed home care agency. Residents would have a  		choice of provider and housing managers must register with a state agency. This  		supportive housing model provides in-home services to frail tenants in  		conventional elderly housing. Services are provided by management in the second  		category, adult care homes or adult family care homes which are subject to  		state licensure. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a>'s</b> regulations define assisted living  		as "a level of <i>service</i> provided by an adult care residence for adults  		who may have physical or mental impairments and require at least a moderate (2  		or more ADL impairments) level of assistance with activities of daily living."  		Facilities must describe the characteristics of the people served and program  		components and services that will be provided. </p>
<p>The confusion around the use of the term is further complicated when  		comparing similar programs by states that do not use the term assisted living  		but, when asked on the survey if they have assisted living, respond  		affirmatively. <b>Missouri</b> is a good example. The state licenses  		residential care facilities and reimburses for personal care and advanced  		personal care through Medicaid. Prior to Medicaid payment, facilities also  		provided personal care. SSI covered room and board and state payments covered  		the service component. Though the term "assisted living" is not used, the  		program resembles the program in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a></b>, which has  		issued draft regulations using the term "assisted living." Personal care is  		provided by a home health agency, an in-home services provider or residential  		care facility. Personal care is available to recipients who need an  		institutional level of care who have chronic, stable conditions that can be  		safely maintained at home. Services include bathing, dressing, hair care, oral  		hygiene, nail care, assistance with toileting, walking, transfers, meal  		preparation, light housework and other tasks. Advanced personal care covers  		assistance for persons with altered body functions who have a catheter, or  		ostomy, require bowel and bladder routines, range of motion exercises, skin  		care and other tasks. The RCF licensure regulations allow up to four beds per  		room and require 1 tub/shower per 20 residents and 1 toilet/lavatory for every  		6 residents. These requirements are typical of many board and care type  		regulations. </p>
<p>While confusion about the definition of assisted living continues to  		frustrate policy makers, providers, developers and consumers, we have assumed  		that it differs from board and care, and it is possible to identify  		characteristics that differentiate assisted living from board and care models.  		An examination of state policies suggests that several variables can be used to  		compare assisted living models. The variables include: the characteristics of  		the living unit, range of services provided or arranged by the facility, the  		health, functional and cognitive status of the residents and the philosophy  		used to guide the model. Assisted living can be identified by one or more of  		the following components of the above categories: </p>
<p><b>The living unit</b> </p>
<ul><li>Individual apartments with kitchenettes or cooking capacity or  		  individual rooms in a homelike setting, shared by consent. </li>
<li>Attached bathrooms. </li>
<li>Lockable doors. </li>
<li>Resident controlled heat. </li>
</ul><p><b>Services provided or arranged</b> </p>
<ul><li>Service package that includes some nursing services. </li>
<li>Service capacity is available to meet unscheduled needs. </li>
<li>Flexible staffing requirements. </li>
</ul><p><b>Health, functional and cognitive status </b></p>
<ul><li>Admission criteria that allow people with nursing needs to be served.  		  </li>
</ul><p><b>Philosophy </b></p>
<ul><li>A philosophy that emphasizes resident independence, dignity, privacy  		  and participation in developing the plan of care and service delivery. </li>
</ul><p>State policy makers begin their efforts to define assisted living for  		specific programmatic reasons. As residents in board and care settings become  		frailer and exhibit increased needs for health services, regulations have been  		amended to allow a higher level of service to be provided and  		admission/retention guidelines are relaxed to prevent further pressure to  		increase the supply of nursing home beds (<b>South Dakota, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a></b>). </p>
<p>Aging-in-place also affects residents in conventional elderly housing  		buildings. A number of states have adopted assisted living policies to provide  		services to allow elders living in public housing to remain. Policy makers are  		also concerned about people who need a more structured and supervised setting,  		but do not require extensive 24 hour nursing care. This group must move from  		their single family home or apartment because of the lack of 24 hour staffing  		to respond to needs that arise during the evening when caregivers or service  		provider staff are not available. Until recently, the only choice was a nursing  		home. Several states have developed assisted living as a residential model  		which allows a person who must move an alternative to a nursing home. These  		programs set standards that are more residential and home-like than board and  		care facilities. Finally, states have seen similarities in the service needs of  		residents in multiple settings and have focused on the service-rich nature of  		assisted living rather than the setting in which services are provided. </p>
<p>As a result, state models can be grouped into three general categories:  		</p>
<ul><li>board and care/institutional, </li>
<li>a new housing and services model</li>
<li>a service model. </li>
</ul><p>Service models can be subdivided into models that allow assisted living  		services to be delivered in multiple settings and those in which services are  		delivered only in apartment settings. <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#table1">Table 1</a> presents  		state assisted living policies by the type of model. State models were  		developed to meet defined needs in different settings. A state's policy may  		address needs in more than one setting. The upgraded board and care approach  		recognizes that residents are aging-in-place and need more care to prevent a  		move to a nursing home. State policies have allowed these facilities to admit  		and retain people who need ADL assistance and some nursing services. Mutually  		exclusive level of care criteria can blur and people who would qualify for  		admission to a nursing home might be retained. The model retains the minimum  		requirements for the building and units (usually bedrooms with shared bathrooms  		and tub/shower areas). </p>
<p>The "services in multiple settings" model also addresses aging-in-place  		in both board and care and larger elderly housing projects. Residents in both  		settings are aging-in-place. A higher level of service may be available in  		settings which were previously licensed as board and care. In addition, similar  		services are provided in a supportive housing program to residents in  		conventional elderly housing. In these settings, some tenants may be totally  		independent and do not receive assisted living services while others require  		assistance with IADLs, ADLs and health care needs. This model includes settings  		which may be licensed and others which are not. States representing this  		approach include <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AK">Alaska</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a>,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MD">Maryland</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NY">New  		York</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NC">North Carolina</a> (proposed), <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#UT">Utah</a>  		and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b>. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MD">Maryland</a></b> provides assisted living services  		through its Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver. The waiver was developed  		to support elderly (62 or older) residents in 150 small group homes and  		conventional apartment buildings, called Senior Assisted Housing, throughout  		the state. Projects are primarily federally subsidized. The program is  		administered by the Office on Aging through contracts with housing management  		companies or other community organizations to deliver services. </p>
<p>The service delivery model licenses or contracts with the agency  		providing assisted living services that may be provided in housing settings.  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New Jersey</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ND">North Dakota</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WI">Wisconsin</a> (draft)</b> are examples of this approach although the  		basis of the program differs. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a>'s</b> program is  		contained in an assisted living regulation while <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a>'s and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ND">North Dakota</a>'s</b> programs  		are defined through a Medicaid HCBS waiver program. Regardless of the basis,  		local and state building codes or existing licensure rules sometimes govern the  		physical structure and new regulations focus on the services provided. </p>
<p>States which separate the housing and service components provide greater  		flexibility, encourage aging-in-place and recognize important realities in the  		fragmentation of funding sources and the existing supply of "housing" types.  		However, these approaches do not address the institutional character of board  		and care programs, nor are they intended to do so. Yet, approaches that focus  		on services do address one of the limitations in board and care models that  		specifically exclude residents who require the level of care provided in a  		nursing home. It recognizes that residents in board and care facilities  		throughout the country may require more care than is allowed through original  		licensure guidelines. Though many states allow services to be delivered by  		community organizations, the "assisted living as a service" model can respond  		to the important dynamics in the resident characteristics of board and care  		facilities. In other settings (non-board and care), it is also a useful way to  		minimize state licensing, focus on meeting service needs and allow residential  		building codes to address the housing structure. </p>

Unlike most  		rules that allow for multiple occupancy, <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New Jersey</a></b>  		requires that each unit include a bathroom with sink, toilet, bathtub and/or  		shower, a kitchenette that includes a refrigerator, cabinet for food storage,  		sink, and outlets for small electrical appliances (eg., microwave, two burner  		cook top, toaster oven). This policy would provide assisted living services in  		facilities licensed as board and care but which meet a higher standard for  		living units. Residents or family members may request that cooking appliances  		may be removed if it is unsafe. In addition, residents may elect to bring their  		own appliances if they meet code requirements. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a>'s</b> draft rules also required single  		occupancy units, unless shared by choice, with private cooking, bathing,  		washing and toilet facilities, lockable doors, temperature controls and  		sprinkler equipment.

<p>The opportunity to prepare a meal or snack is an important variable in  		determining whether a unit is home-like. While many residents may be too  		impaired to prepare their own meal, operators reports that family members and  		friends often fix meals for residents when they visit and the presence of a  		kitchenette adds to the residential ambiance even for people who do not prepare  		their own meals from time to time. All residences must provide a kitchenette or  		access to cooking capacity (kitchen, microwave) in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AZ">Arizona</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a>,  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WI">Wisconsin</a></b>. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AK">Alaska</a>'s</b> policy does not specify requirements  		for units although shared rooms are allowed and the policy is flexible to  		accommodate small group homes facilities which are likely in such a rural  		state. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b> requires private rooms, apartments, or  		semi-private rooms. If shared rooms are offered, there must be no less than one  		bathroom for every four persons. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a></b> allows  		single and double occupancy units with lockable doors. New construction must  		include private baths for each unit. Existing buildings may provide private  		half baths and one bathing facility for every three units. </p>
<p>Two types of units are allowed in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NY">New York</a></b>.  		Enriched housing models (conventional housing) must provide single occupancy  		apartment units, unless shared by agreement, with full bathroom, living and  		dining space and equipment for preparing and storing food. Adult care homes  		offer single or double occupancy bedrooms and must have 1 toilet for every six  		residents and 1 tub/shower for every ten residents. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b> also allows several occupancy types including assisted  		living apartments with 220 square feet or 160 square if the building is being  		remodeled to participate in the assisted living program; residential care  		apartments (double occupancy, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom with 350 square  		feet); and residential care non-apartments (double occupancy, 16 or fewer  		units). </p>
<p>The institutional model is predominantly a shared model. Residents share  		bedrooms, although many states limit occupancy to two persons per room,  		bathrooms and tub/shower rooms. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AL">Alabama</a></b> requires  		bedrooms with 80 square feet for single occupancy and 130 square feet for  		double units. If sitting areas are included, the square footage requirements  		are 160 for single rooms and 200 square feet for double rooms. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a>'s</b> existing adult care residence rules allow single  		rooms (100 square feet) and multiple occupancy (80 square feet per occupant)  		with toilet and wash basins for every seven residents and a bath tub for every  		ten residents. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII2" id="sectionIII2">Tenant Policy</a></h3>
<p>Two distinctions are drawn concerning tenant policy. State licensure  		rules often set parameters on who may be served in an assisted living  		residence, however, state reimbursement policies may set different criteria for  		residents that will be reimbursed in assisted living. In fact, most states,  		except <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a></b>, limit their reimbursement to  		tenants that meet the level of care criteria for placement in a nursing home.  		</p>
<p>While many states have defined the characteristics of tenants who may be  		served, a draft report from an advisory group in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WI">Wisconsin</a></b> has recommended that services be limited to 28  		hours a week as a means of assuring that tenants would not be discharged  		prematurely. The limit exceeds the average hours of service provided to  		participants in the state's home care program. </p>
<p>A few states have modeled tenant policies on the definition of Medicare  		skilled services. Anyone needing services beyond the Medicare definition for a  		period that exceeds the definition are not consider appropriate for assisted  		living. The definition has been equated with a judgement about safety and the  		level of care that can safely be provided in a homelike setting. However,  		Medicare definitions have been developed for reimbursement purposes and do not  		define the line between care that can be delivered at home and care that should  		be provided in a nursing home. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b> developed precise rules for admission  		and continued residency. New residents must be able to perform ADLs with  		supervision or assistance; do not require 24 hour nursing supervision; are  		capable of taking their own medication or may require administration of  		medication and the residence has licensed staff to provide the service; do not  		have bed sores or stage 2, 3, or 4 pressure ulcers, are able to participate in  		social activities; capable of self-preservation; is not bedridden; nonviolent;  		and does not require 24 hour mental health care. </p>
<p>The criteria for continued residency do not allow residents to be  		retained if they develop a need for 24 hour supervision; become bedridden for  		more than 14 days, become totally dependent in 4 or more ADLs (exceptions for  		quadraplegics, paraplegics and victims of muscular dystrophy, multiple  		sclerosis and other neuro-muscular diseases if the resident is able to  		communicate their needs and do not require assistance with complex medical  		problems). Residents may stay if they develop stage 2 pressure sores but must  		be relocated for stage 3 and 4 pressure sores. Residents who are medically  		unstable, become a danger to self or others or experience cognitive decline to  		prevent simple decision making may not be retained. </p>
<p>This lengthy list of resident conditions which may and may not be  		treated may be replaced by using the Medicare skilled nursing definition to  		establish the admission and retention policy. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NJ">New Jersey</a></b> has developed the broadest tenant  		policy by allowing, but not requiring, care for people who require 24 hour,  		seven day a week nursing supervision, are bedridden longer than 14 days,  		consistently and totally dependent in four or more ADLs, have cognitive decline  		that interferes with simple decisions, require treatment of stage three or four  		pressure sores or multiple stage two sores, are a danger to self or others or  		has a medically unstable condition and/or special health problems. The  		admission agreement has to specify if the residence will retain residents with  		one or more of these characteristics and the additional costs which may be  		charged. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AL">Alabama</a></b>, which has a board and care model, does  		not allow residents to be served in assisted living who require the level of  		care provided in a nursing home. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#RI">Rhode Island</a></b>, another  		board and care model, allows people who need nursing assistance to be served,  		but does not allow people needing skilled care to be served. </p>
<p>The <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#VA">Virginia</a></b> requirements offer flexibility for  		adult care residences to develop a service program that reflects their market  		segment and the service needs of the market.

<h3><a name="sectionIII3" id="sectionIII3">Services</a></h3>
<p>The extent of service provision has been a key component of assisted  		living policy. Mutually exclusive resident policies, which prohibit anyone  		needing a nursing home level of services from being served in board and care,  		are being revised. State policy makers are focusing on the level of care that  		can be provided in a person's single family home or apartment and allowing the  		delivery of similar services in assisted living settings. Drawing the line has  		been controversial. Some nursing home operators see assisted living as  		competition for their "patients" and oppose rules which allow skilled nursing  		services to be delivered outside the home or nursing home setting. </p>
<p>Most states require an assessment and the development of a plan of care  		that determines what services will be provided, by whom and when. Residents  		often have a prominent role in determining what they will receive from the  		residence and what tasks they will do for themselves. </p>
<p>The key factor in assisted living policies is the extent of skilled  		nursing services. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#CT">Connecticut</a></b> allows client teaching,  		wellness counseling, health promotion and disease prevention, medication  		administration and skilled services to clients with chronic but stable  		conditions. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b> developed specific regulations in  		response to complaints from the nursing home industry that listed the services  		that may be provided and those that could not be provided. Facilities may  		provide limited nursing services (eg., medication administration and  		supervision of self-administration, applying heat, passive range of motion  		exercises, ice caps, urine tests, routine dressings that do not require packing  		or irrigation and others), intermittent nursing services (eg., change of  		colostomy bag and related care, catheter care, administration of oxygen,  		routine care of an amputation or fracture, prophylactic and palliative skin  		care). </p>
<p>Facilities in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#FL">Florida</a></b> <i>may not</i> provide  		oral or nasopharyngeal auctioning, assistance with tube feeding, monitoring of  		blood gasses, intermittent positive pressure breathing therapy, intensive  		rehabilitation services for a stroke or fracture or treatment of surgical  		incisions which are not clean and free from infection and any treatment  		requiring 24 hour nursing supervision. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a></b> has  		developed a list of skilled services that may and may not be delivered by  		licensed nurses and unlicensed staff. Nursing services are differentiated by  		licensure category. RNs or LPNs may provide insertion of catheters, nursing  		assessments, and glucometer readings. Unlicensed staff may provide the  		following under supervision of an RN or LPN: stage one skin care, routine  		ostomy care, enema, catheter care, and wound care. Changes in the nurse  		practice are pending in the legislature which would greater delegation. </p>
<p><b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a>'s</b> policy allow a wide range of  		delegation under which nurses must train unlicensed staff for each resident  		receiving delegated services. </p>
<p>Legislation in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a></b>, as in other  		states, does not allow twenty four hour nursing services. However, skilled  		services may only be provided by a certified home health agency on a part time  		or intermittent basis not to exceed 90 days in a one year period. Medical  		conditions requiring services on a periodic, scheduled basis are also allowed.  		In addition, residents may "engage or contract with any licensed health care  		professional and providers to obtain necessary health care services ... to the  		same extent available to persons residing in private homes." The <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a></b> statute only allows skilled nursing services  		to be provided by a certified home health agency. As a result, although  		regulations have not been issued, registered nurses, if hired by an assisted  		living facility, presumably, would not be allowed to deliver skilled care.  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a>'s</b> pending policy will limit skilled services to  		120 days with exceptions for diets, dressing changes and medication  		administration. </p>
<p>The <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a></b> statute specifies a minimum  		level of personal care services that must be provided (bathing, dressing,  		ambulation) and requires that tenant agreements include the services which will  		be provided and those which will not be provided. Facilities certified under  		the law may offer a broader range of personal care services. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AK">Alaska</a>'s</b> regulations also require that tenant contracts  		spell out the services and accommodations that will be provided which reflects  		the diversity of providers and varied availability of service providers in the  		state. Intermittent nursing services are allowed to residents who do not  		require 24 hour nursing care and supervision and tasks approved by the Board of  		Nursing may be delegated to unlicensed staff. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AZ">Arizona</a></b>  		also allows intermittent home health (nursing, home health aide, supplies,  		equipment and therapies) in its demonstration program. </p>
<p>Because of its funding source, <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#NY">New York</a></b> allows  		for skilled nursing, home health aide and therapies. Regular Medicaid state  		plan services have been included in a capitated rate to include the full range  		of Medicaid long term care services that can be delivered in the home. </p>
<p>A concept paper in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ID">Idaho</a></b> would require personal  		care (eating, bathing, dressing, toileting and walking), three meals a day in a  		common dinning room, housekeeping, transportation, medication management,  		social and recreational activities and laundry services. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MD">Maryland</a>'s</b> policy includes a similar list but adds 24 hour  		on-site supervision in group homes but not in the Senior Assisted Housing  		setting. Skilled nursing is not included in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ID">Idaho</a> and  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MD">Maryland</a></b>. In <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#UT">Utah</a></b>, which has a  		similar list of services, facilities must arrange for necessary medical and  		dental care although medication administration of prescription drugs is  		allowed. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ME">Maine</a>'s</b> pending policy only specifies skilled  		services when they are provided by a licensed home health agency. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII4" id="sectionIII4">Financing and  		Reimbursement</a></h3>
<p>States have developed a number of methodologies to set rates for  		subsidized residents. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a></b> uses a five tiered  		methodology for reimbursing providers based on the type and degree of  		impairments (See <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#table2">table</a>). <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#AZ">Arizona</a> has  		developed three rate classes based on the needs of the resident. <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a></b> is also planning to use a rate structure with five  		tiers ranging from $200 to $1400 a month that vary based on the number and type  		of ADL impairments, skilled nursing needs and behavior needs. The room and  		board payment is likely to be $700 a month. The service rate was developed  		after consultation by the Department of Aging with assisted living providers.  		<b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ND">North Dakota</a></b> uses a rate classification system that is  		derived from a point system that measures a person's level of service need.  		</p>
<p>Flat rates are used in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a></b>. <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA"><b>Massachusetts</b></a> uses two sources of financing to pay for  		assisted living. Medicaid state plan services are available to reimburse for  		Medicaid recipients and a special program (Managed Care in Housing) funded with  		general revenues is available for elders who are not eligible for Medicaid is  		administered by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs. The service payment is  		$33.70 per day for Medicaid recipients and the Managed Care in Housing program  		rate is $817 a month. The financing sources were developed prior to passage of  		the assisted living legislation and the program represents an approach that  		combines two approaches: services in elderly housing and purpose built assisted  		living sites. <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MA"><b>Massachusetts</b></a>, with its higher  		development costs, is the only states that has set a separate SSI payment for  		assisted living of $920 a month which is considerably higher than the Community  		standard (the payment for an aged person living alone in the community) and the  		board and care standard. The increased rate reflects the higher real estate and  		development costs in the state and provides access for Medicaid recipients to  		market rate and mixed income developments. However, legislation creating an  		assisted living certification program also Suspended use of the higher rate  		until the Medical Assistance Division completes a report showing the projected  		demand and costs to the state. The report was Submitted to the legislature on  		March 1, 1995 and concluded that a higher payment standard would save $2389 per  		participant for a total savings of $239,800 in FY 95 rising to savings of $4.8  		million in FY 99 as the supply of assisted living residences for low income  		residents increases. </p>

<p>Nearly all states allow assistance with self-administration of  		medications or administration of medications by licensed nurses. The  		predominant provisions for staffing require that facilities provide an adequate  		number and type of staff necessary to fulfill the service needs of residents as  		required by plans of care. A few states require ratios of awake or on-site  		staff but the clear trend substitutes flexible staffing plans and schedules for  		specific staffing ratios. </p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII6" id="sectionIII6">States Developing Policy  		Options</a></h3>
<p>The trend among states to develop assisted living continues. As  		frequently as states move from study, analysis and recommendations to passing  		legislation and issuing regulations, other states have begun their own  		initiatives. Assisted living has attracted interest in a number of states that  		have created a process to examine options and make recommendations. In <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a></b>, a task force was created to re-examine legislation  		passed in 1993 and draft regulations developed to implement the legislation.  		Language was added to the state budget bill in 1994 that halted implementation.  		As the process for developing the regulations proceeded, segments of the  		assisted living and nursing home industries expressed concerns about the model  		and the direction of the regulations. A special committee consisting of 6  		legislators, 4 state agencies, 4 provider groups (3 nursing home and 1 assisted  		living), the Area Agency on Aging Association, the Ombudsman Association, AARP  		and a taxpayer group was created to review the program. </p>
<p>The task force was created to address opposition to Chapter 3726 and the  		proposed regulations dealing with the unit requirements, the level of services  		provided in assisted living and the medical conditions of tenants. While a  		formal consensus report was not submitted, the governor's budget included  		several proposals contained in the draft report. The budget bill would repeal  		the assisted living statute and create a new category of residential care  		facility to replace the current rest home classification. Residential care  		facilities would be able to provide up to 120 days of skilled nursing services  		with exceptions for special diets, medication administration and dressing  		changes. In addition, the <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OH">Ohio</a></b> Department on Aging  		would be authorized to create an assisted living program, funded through a  		Medicaid HCBS waiver, that is likely to use the rules developed for the  		licensure category. </p>
<p>A task force consisting of state agencies, consumers, nursing home  		associations, and assisted living providers has been meeting in <b>Delaware</b>  		to recommend a policy. Requirements for self-preservation has been a contested  		issue. The task force has considered private apartments, elderly housing and  		residential care as settings for the provision of assisted living.  		<b>Louisiana</b> state officials have begun drafting an assisted living policy  		statement. A meeting with Aging, Health and Medicaid staff was held to initiate  		discussion of the primary elements of the policy statement. Monthly meetings  		between staff of the Governor's Office on Aging, the Department of Health and  		Hospitals (Medicaid) and the Department of Social Services (regulations) have  		been held. It is anticipated that the Department of Health and Hospitals will  		submit a Medicaid Home and Community Based Services waiver to fund two pilot  		assisted living projects. Licensing rules are being drafted with a projected  		effective date of July 1, 1995. </p>
<p>In <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#HI">Hawaii</a></b> the 1994 legislative session assed  		House Concurrent resolution 377 which directed the formation of a task force to  		study and make recommendations on assisted living. A 7 member legislative task  		force that includes three state agencies and provider groups has been meeting  		weekly. The task force is chaired the Gerontology Administrator of the Child  		and Family Services agency which is a large social services agency. The group  		organized a conference on assisted living in the fall of 1994 and presented a  		report to the legislature which has resulted in several bills being filed.  		Members made site visits to facilities in <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a> and  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a>. The report recommended adoption of a common  		definition of assisted living to mean "a special combination of housing,  		personalized supportive services and health care designed to respond to  		individual needs. Assisted living promotes choice, responsibility,  		independence, privacy, dignity and individuality and encourages the involvement  		of a resident's family and friends. The setting within an assisted living  		facility is usually a private studio apartment and bath." </p>
<p>The state faces constraints due to high land costs and must examine the  		use of existing housing capacity rather than new construction to implement a  		new model. The report recommends that counties be encouraged to modify their  		land use policies to support assisted living and that state loans and bonds be  		made available a favorable interest rates to stimulate development. </p>
<p>Legislation authorizing development of assisted living regulations and  		authorizing funding through a Medicaid waiver is pending before the state  		legislature which meets until the end of April. The legislature is expected to  		pass a bill directing the development of assisted living regulations modeled  		after the <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#OR">Oregon</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#WA">Washington</a> programs  		and another bill providing for nurse delegation in a range of settings (nursing  		home, hospitals, assisted living and others). Another bill is expected to pass  		that provides mortgage insurance through the state housing finance agency for  		non-profit agencies which develop assisted living programs. </p>
<p>A resolution directing the Department of Human Resources to study and  		report to the legislature on the feasibility of developing a Medicaid Home and  		Community Based Services waiver for assisted living. In addition, <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#HI">Hawaii</a></b> is implementing an 1115 demonstration waiver, called  		Health QUEST, that provides health care for Medicaid recipients and uninsured  		residents with incomes below 300% of the poverty level through managed care  		plans. Planning has begun to expand the waiver to SSI recipients and to include  		long term care in the service package. The work group is interested in  		including assisted living as part of the benefit package. Implementation is not  		expected until 1999 to allow ample time for implementation of the current  		waiver. </p>
<p>A seven member Residential Care Council examined assisted living options  		for 18 months in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#ID">Idaho</a></b>. A change in administrations  		and lack of funding limited the scope of the work. A concept paper was issued  		which may serve as the basis for legislation that was expected to be filed by  		the Assisted Living and Residential Care Associations. A legislative task force  		was created in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#IN">Indiana</a></b> to make recommendations on  		assisted living. After a series of hearings, a report was issued but no action  		has been taken to develop a formal proposal. </p>
<p>In <b>Michigan</b>, the Long Term Care Working Group, appointed by  		Governor Engler, is developing administrative rules for assisted living.  		Officials from the Office of Services to the Aging, Public Health, Mental  		Health, the Department of Social Services (Medicaid) and the State Housing  		Authority are members of the Working Group. Draft rules are being developed for  		review by the Working Group at their January, 1995 meeting. </p>
<p>Legislation consolidating the licensing of personal care homes,  		retirement homes, adult foster care and adult day care under a broader  		residential care category will be filed with the <b>Montana</b> legislature for  		consideration during the 1995 session. Another proposal will provide funding  		for 50 slots for Medicaid waiver participants in residential care homes that  		are comparable to assisted living. </p>
<p>The <b>Oklahoma</b> Aging Services Division organized a task force to  		study assisted living in the spring of 1994 which included representatives of  		both aging and people with disabilities, providers and others. The task force  		developed a broad definition that considered assisted living as a service  		available in multiple settings 24 hours a day for unscheduled needs. The group  		also identified a philosophy to guide their work that emphasized privacy,  		dignity, and resident involvement in the assessment and care planning process.  		Committees were formed to focus on the housing environment, services to be  		provided, clients to be served and funding sources. Legislation was drafted and  		circulated for comment that would have replaced the current residential care  		licensure category with a new assisted living category. The task force is  		refining the legislative proposal based on reactions from affected groups. The  		task force is addressing issues dealing the level of care that can be provided  		outside a nursing home, the role for residential care facilities, financing for  		low income residents, and the appropriate models for serving people with  		dementia versus people with disabilities who prefer an independent living  		model. </p>
<p>State agencies in <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a></b> have formed a task  		force to build on their Medicaid waiver program and develop a more formalized  		licensure policy on assisted living. </p>
<p>The <b>Vermont</b> Department of Aging and Disabilities convened a  		working group to consider options for developing assisted living models. The  		group recommended conducting pilot projects to gain experience with several  		approaches, including the supportive or congregate housing services model in  		which frail residents in conventional elderly housing buildings receive  		services. This approach would be comparable to <b><a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MD">Maryland</a>'s</b> model. The <b>Vermont</b> Department of Aging and  		Disability has subsequently created an advisory group to assist with the  		development of the state's Medicaid home and Community Based Services Waiver  		renewal. A subcommittee has been formed to deal with assisted living and the  		renewal application may contain a proposal to add assisted living as a service  		as <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#MN">Minnesota</a> and <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#TX">Texas</a> have done. The  		governor's proposed 1996 budget included funds to implement an assisted living  		demonstration program through a Medicaid HCBS waiver. </p>
<p>The policy development process need not begin with public officials. In  		<b>Illinois</b>, The Center for Eldercare Choices (a Foundation formed by the  		Illinois Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, the Life Services  		Network of Illinois) initiated a statewide, two day summit on assisted living  		in October 1994. Thirty three policy leaders (legislators, state agency  		officials, housing and service providers) were invited to examine issues around  		residential alternatives to develop a framework for working on an assisted  		living proposal for the state. The session reviewed background information on  		assisted living and created a coalition to guide policy development. </p>
<p>The group identified seven elements of assisted living: risk, services,  		choice, cost, home, internal community and external community and phrases which  		describe each area (see appendix). A matrix presenting the strengths and  		weaknesses, opportunities and threats posed by assisted living was devised as  		well as a plan with 6 options for action. Three options were considered a  		priority, and task forces were established. The three priorities identified  		were: to develop a definition of assisted living, to create strategies for  		identifying and educating stakeholders, and to study and recommend provisions  		for legislative and regulatory oversight. One year timetables were established  		for each task force. </p>
<p>Interest in the work of the task forces has attracted the attention of  		other interest groups around the state. Subsequently, membership of the task  		forces was extended well beyond the original summit participants. </p>

Supportive service are available 24 hours a day, to meet  		  scheduled and unscheduled needs, in a way that promotes maximum dignity and  		  independence for each resident and involves the resident's family, neighbors  		  and friends. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging</b> </p>
<blockquote><p>Assisted living is a philosophy/program which combines and coordinates  		  housing, personal and health-related services needed to help an individual  		  maintain maximum independence and choice. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>American Seniors Housing Association</b> </p>
<blockquote><p>A coordinated array of personal care, health services and other  		  supportive services available 24 hours per day, to residents who have been  		  assessed to need these services. Assisted living promotes resident  		  self-direction and participation in decisions that emphasize independence,  		  individuality, privacy, dignity and residential surroundings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>National Association of Residential Care Facilities</b> </p>
<blockquote><p>Residential care facility means a home or facility of any size,  		  operated for profit or not for profit, which undertakes through its owner/s or  		  management to provide food, housing and support with activities of daily living  		  and/or protective care for two or more adult residents not related to the owner  		  or administrator. Residential care homes are also know as assisted living  		  facilities, foster homes, board and care homes, sheltered care homes, etc.  		  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>National Association of State Units on Aging </b></p>
<blockquote><p>NASUA subscribes to a definition of assisted living which acknowledges  		  the deep desire of America's elders to reside in their own homes or in a  		  homelike environment. Accordingly, the Association views assisted living as  		  referring to a homelike congregate residence providing individual living units  		  where appropriate supportive services are provided through individualized  		  service plans. Assisted living is first and foremost a home in which residents'  		  independence and individuality are supported and in which their privacy and  		  right to self-expression are respected. Contributing to its appeal is an  		  emphasis placed upon maximum autonomy, costs which appear to be lower than  		  those for nursing home and a track record of a high degree of consumer  		  satisfaction. </p>
<p>The position paper discusses several principles which include homelike  		  environment, foster resident capabilities, honor the right of resident's to age  		  in place, provide individualized supportive services which are developed with  		  the full participation of informed residents, offer resident full disclosure  		  and ensure that resident's rights are protected. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Federal Agencies</h4>
<p><b>US Health Care Financing Administration</b> (for Medicaid Home and  		Community Based Services Waivers). HCFA developed a definition of assisted  		living for states to use in their Home and Community Based Services Waiver  		programs (2176 waivers). The definition states: </p>
<blockquote><p>Assisted Living. Personal care and services, homemaker, chore,  		  attendant care, companion services, medication oversight (to the extent  		  permitted under state law), therapeutic social and recreational programming,  		  provided in a licensed community care facility, in connection with residing in  		  the facility. This service includes 24 hours on site response staff to meet  		  scheduled or unpredictable needs and to provide supervision of safety and  		  security. Other individuals or agencies may also furnish care directly, or  		  under arrangement with the community care facility, but the care provided by  		  these other entities supplements that provided by the community care facility  		  and does not supplant it. </p>
<p>Care is furnished to individuals who reside in their own living units  		  (which may include dually occupied units when both occupants consent to the  		  arrangement) which may or may not include kitchenette and/or living rooms as  		  well as bedrooms. Living units may be locked at the discretion of the client  		  except when a physician or mental health professional has certified in writing  		  that the client is sufficiently cognitively impaired as to be a danger to self  		  or others if given the opportunity to lock the door. (This requirement does not  		  apply where it conflicts with the fire code). Each living unit is separate and  		  distinct from each other. The facility must have a central dining room, living  		  room or parlor, and common activity center(s) (which may also serve as living  		  rooms or dining rooms). Routines of care provision and service delivery must be  		  client-driven to the maximum extent possible. </p>
<p>Assisted living services may also include (check all that apply): </p>
<ul><li>Home health care </li>
<li>Physical therapy </li>
<li>Occupational therapy </li>
<li>Speech therapy </li>
<li>Medication administration </li>
<li>Intermittent skilled nursing services </li>
<li>Transportation specified in the plan of care </li>
<li>Other (specify) </li>
</ul><p>However, nursing and skilled therapy services are incidental, rather  		  than integral to the provision of assisted living services. Payment will not be  		  made for 24 hour skilled nursing care or supervision. FFP is not available in  		  the cost of room and board furnished in conjunction with residing in an  		  assisted living facility. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>HUD</b> (232 Program) </p>
<blockquote><p>Assisted living facility means a public facility, proprietary  		  facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation that is used for the  		  care of the frail elderly, and that: </p>
<ol><li>Is licensed and regulated by the state or if there is no state law  			 providing for such licensing and regulation by the state, by the municipality  			 or other political subdivision in which the facility is located; </li>
<li>Makes available to residents supportive services to assist the  			 residents in carrying out activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing,  			 eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the  			 toilet, doing laundry, preparing meals, shopping for personal items, obtaining  			 and taking medications, managing money, using the telephone, or performing  			 light or heavy housework, and which may make available to residents home health  			 care services such as nursing and therapy.; </li>
<li>Provide separate dwelling units for residents, each of which may  			 contain a full kitchen or bathroom, and includes common rooms and other  			 facilities appropriate for the provision of supportive services to residents of  			 the facility. </li>

<h4>General Policy Approach</h4>
<p>The state has a licensure category for assisted living but does not  		differentiate assisted living from board and care. In 1994, the state  		Commission on Aging organized a series of forums on long term care, held a  		statewide summit on long term care and formed a Policy Development Council to  		make recommendations for the reform of the state's long term care system.  		During the forums and the statewide summit, several nursing home  		administrators, consumers and others testified to the need for an assisted  		living program that expanded the range of services that could be provided in  		assisted living and changes the admission policy to allow people who meet the  		nursing home level of care criteria to be served in assisted living. However, a  		new administration and the announcement of a substantial Medicaid deficit are  		likely to effect the policy process and the environment for expanding services.  		</p>
<p>The regulations license three categories of facilities. Congregate  		assisted living facilities serve 17 or more adults, group assisted living  		facilities serve 4-16 adults and family assisted living facilities serve 2-3  		adults. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The regulations do not require separate living and sleeping quarters.  		Private bedrooms without sitting areas must provide 80 square feet and double  		rooms 130 square feet. If sitting areas are included, private rooms must be 160  		square feet and double rooms 200 square feet. Bath tubs or showers must be  		available for every 8 beds, and lavatories and toilers for every six beds.  		Lockable doors are permitted. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>The regulations provide that assisted living facilities may serve  		persons "who are not in need of hospital or nursing home care." Facilities may  		not serve anyone with chronic health conditions requiring extensive nursing  		care and/or daily medication supervision, persons requiring daily professional  		observation or the exercise of professional judgement by staff. People who need  		assistance from more than one person to evacuate a building, show severe  		symptoms of senility, require restraint or treatment for addiction of alcohol  		or drugs may not be admitted or retained. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Assisted living facilities must provide personal care for bathing, oral  		hygiene, hair care and nail care. Facilities may provide for general  		observation and may arrange or assist residents to obtain medical attention or  		nursing services when needed. Home health may be provided by a certified agency  		as long as residents receiving home health services do not require hospital or  		nursing home care. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>Other than SSI, no public financing is available for assisted living.  		</p>
<h4>Medication</h4>
<p>Assistance is limited to reminders, reading container labels to the  		resident, checking the dosage, opening containers. Registered nurses are  		allowed to administer medications for residents who do not require acute,  		continuous or extensive medical or nursing care. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>The regulations require at least 1 staff member per 6 residents 24 hours  		a day and personal care staff to meet the needs of residents. </p>

<h3><a name="AK" id="AK">Alaska</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Policy Approach</h4>
<p>In 1994 the Alaska legislature passed a law to encourage the development  		of assisted living homes to provide a homelike environment for older and  		persons with a mental or physical disability needing assistance with activities  		of daily living. The law promotes resident participation in the community,  		recognizes the resident's right and responsibility to evaluate and make choices  		concerning the services to be provided. The law provides for licensing assisted  		living homes for elders, people with dementia, and people with physical, mental  		or developmental disabilities. The Department of Health and Social Services  		will license homes for people with mental or developmental disabilities and the  		Department of Administration will license homes for older people, people with  		dementia and people with physical disabilities. The agencies are allowed to  		issue regulations setting additional requirements or standards. </p>
<p>The law is effective January 1, 1995. Draft regulations have been  		prepared and were issued for comment in February. The regulations set minimal  		requirements which will be defined in more detail in policies and procedures  		which will be developed and issued during the first year of the program as  		experience during the transition is gained. State officials expect that most  		providers will be small and personal care, RN assessment and oversight will be  		arranged or contracted from other organizations. </p>
<p>Fees are charged for a license. A base fee of $100 is charged for  		facilities of 3-5 residents and $250 for 6 and larger. In addition, applicants  		must pay $50 per resident for each resident over 2. Holders of residential care  		facility and adult foster care licenses may convert to an assisted living  		license. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>The law creates "Chapter 33. Assisted Living Homes" to emphasize that  		assisted living serves as the resident's home. The statute applies to  		residential facilities serving three or more adults who are not related to the  		owner of the residence by blood or marriage that provide housing, food service,  		and provide, obtain or offer to provide assistance with activities of daily  		living, personal assistance (help with IADLs, obtaining supportive services  		[recreational, leisure, transportation, social, legal, et.al.], being aware of  		the resident's whereabouts when traveling in the community, and monitoring  		activities) or a combination of ADL assistance and personal assistance. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>No requirements are specified for the type of unit. Shared rooms are  		allowed. Facilities must meet life safety code requirements applicable for  		buildings its size. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>The home and each resident must sign a residential service contract that  		describes the services and accommodations to be provided, rates, the rights,  		duties and obligations of the resident, and the policies and procedures for  		terminating the contract. Residents who have exceeded the 45 consecutive day  		limit for receiving 24 hour skilled nursing (see below) may continue to live at  		the home if the home and the resident or resident's representative have  		consulted with the resident's physician, discussed the consequences and risks  		and a revised plan without 24 hour nursing has been reviewed by a registered  		nurse. Terminally ill residents may continue to reside in the residence if a  		physician certifies that the person's needs are being met. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Each resident must have a plan of care developed within 30 days of  		move-in that identifies strengths and weaknesses performing ADLs, physical  		disabilities and impairments, preferences for roommates, living environment,  		food, recreation, religious affiliation and other factors. The plan also  		identifies the ADLs with which the resident needs help, how help will be  		provided by the home or other agencies, and health needs and how they will be  		addressed. The plan must also identify the resident's reasonable wants and how  		those will be addressed. If health related services are provided or arranged,  		the evaluation must be done quarterly. If no health services are provided, an  		annual evaluation is required. Assisted living homes may provide intermittent  		nursing services to residents who do not require 24 hour care and supervision.  		Intermittent nursing tasks may be delegated to staff who are not licensed as a  		nurse for tasks designated by the board of nursing. 24 hour skilled care may be  		provided for not more than 45 consecutive days. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>When the regulations are finalized, rates will be adjusted to reflect  		the level of care and regional variations across the state. Rates will be  		comparable to current rates for residential care I and II which in the  		Anchorage area are 38.44 a day for Level I and $48.44 for Level II. The level  		II rate in the Northwest region is $80.64 a day. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>"Home staff persons" may provide medication reminders, reading labels,  		observing a resident while taking medication, checking self-administered dosage  		against the label, reassuring the resident that the dosage is correct, and  		directing/guiding the hand of a resident at the resident's request. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Homes must have the type and number of staff needed to operate the home  		and must develop a staffing plan that is appropriate to provide services  		required by resident care plans. </p>

<h3><a name="AZ" id="AZ">Arizona</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Policy Approach</h4>
<p>Chapter 163 (1993) authorized the Director of Health Services to certify  		centers for the delivery of home and community based services. The law views  		supportive residential living services as in-home services. Participation is  		capped at 100 "members" at any point in time until September 30, 1995. An  		additional 100 members may be served after October 1, 1995. The pilot  		supportive residential living (assisted living) project operates in Maricopa  		County. Although the statute and regulations do not use the term assisted  		living, the pilot operates according to the principles of assisted living.  		Providers submit a statement that demonstrates their knowledge and commitment  		to the philosophy of supportive residential living. </p>
<p>Three facilities have been certified with 18, 28 and 54 units. </p>
<p>Data concerning resident satisfaction, number of residents, length of  		stay, level of care, emergency room utilization, urgent care visits, days of  		hospitalization, average days and cost, average daily cost of supportive  		residential living, service levels, demographic information, functional  		information, and medical information must be reported by sites. A one year  		report on resident satisfaction will be issued in March 1995. An evaluation  		will be submitted to the Governor's Long Term Care Committee by December 1995  		and a full report is due to the legislature in 1996 when a decision will be  		made to expand the program statewide or terminate the demonstration. </p>
<p>The residence must meet local building and fire codes based on  		construction and occupancy. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>Each unit must be constructed as a private apartment with living and  		sleeping space, kitchen area, bathroom and storage areas with a minimum of 220  		square feet, excluding the bathroom. Units must have individually keyed locks  		and resident temperature controls. Kitchen areas must have a sink,  		refrigerator, cooking appliance that can be disconnected or removed, space for  		food preparation and storage space for utensils and supplies. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Projects cannot serve anyone who needs continuous nursing services,  		cannot direct care, needs continuous therapeutic intervention to sustain life  		and is violent toward self or others. In addition, non-Medicaid (ALTCS)  		residents cannot require more than one person to assist with ambulation,  		transfer from bed, chair or toilet or other ADLs, is unable to self-propel a  		wheelchair or cannot get out of bed more than three hours a day. </p>
<p>Resident agreements include the terms of occupancy, a statement of the  		services provided, services that are available for an additional cost, monthly  		fees and expenses, deposit and refund policies, termination procedures, copies  		of the rules and resident rights. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Prior to move in, an interdisciplinary team conducts an assessment and  		develops a plan with the resident or their representative that identifies the  		services needed, the person responsible for providing the service, method and  		frequency of services, measurable resident goals and the person responsible for  		assisting the resident in an emergency. </p>
<p>The statute allows intermittent home health (nursing, aide, medical  		supplies, equipment or appliances and therapies), homemaker, personal care,  		medically necessary transportation and meals. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>Rates have been negotiated with each project within guidelines specified  		in the waiver. Program administrators used rates set for adult foster care,  		nursing facilities, the Oregon assisted living program and the Arizona HCBS  		program as guidelines in working with centers. Administrators also consider the  		package of services provided and ask each residence to propose a unit rate.  		Three classes of rates are negotiated based on the level of care: intermediate,  		low skill and high skilled. The SSI payment rate is $446 a month of which  		$391.10 is paid to the residence to cover room and board charges and $66.90 is  		retained by the resident. </p>

<p>Facilities must have policies and procedures governing the procurement,  		administration, storing and disposal of medications. Staff may supervise  		self-administration by opening bottle caps, reading labels, checking the dosage  		and observing the resident taking the medication. Medications which cannot be  		self-administered must be administered by an RN or "as otherwise permitted."  		The phrase as otherwise permitted was included to accommodate any future  		statutory changes in the state's nurse practice act. Medication organizers can  		be prepared a month in advance by an RN or family members. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>The center manager may employ or contract with staff for supportive  		services, supervision, food service, housekeeping and maintenance, social and  		activity programs and general supervision. At least one staff must be awake and  		on-duty. An RN must be available to provide nursing service specified in each  		plan of care. No staff ratios are included in the regulations and centers are  		required to have sufficient personnel available to provide services identified  		in resident care plans. </p>
<p>Managers must receive 20 hours of continuing education credit each year.  		Staff are required to receive an orientation from the center and complete a 16  		hour training program, approved by the county within 60 days of their  		employment as well as 20 hours of in-service training a year. </p>

<h3><a name="CT" id="CT">Connecticut</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Policy Approach</h4>
<p>Assisted living regulations were issued by the Health Department and  		approved by the Legislative Review Committee in December, 1994. The regulations  		take a unique approach by allowing "managed residential communities" (MRCs) to  		offer assisted living services through assisted living services agencies  		(ALSAs). MRCs may obtain a license to also serve as an ALSA. </p>
<p>The regulations focus on the licensing of agencies to provide services  		rather than the building and services as an entity. MRCs have to notify the  		health department of their intention to provide assisted living services. The  		ALSA, either the MRC or another agency, must be licensed by the Department of  		Public Health and Addiction Services to provide services. The MRC is not  		licensed by the Department of Public Health and Addiction services. MRCs must  		show evidence of compliance with local zoning ordinances and building codes.  		</p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted living services: nursing services and assistance with ADLs  		provided to clients living within a managed group living environment having  		supportive services that encourage clients primarily age 55 or older to  		maintain a maximum level of independence. Routine household services may be  		provided as assisted living services or by the managed residential community.  		These services provide an alternative for elderly persons who require some help  		or aid with ADLs and/or nursing services. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>To qualify as a managed residential community and a setting in which  		assisted living services may be provided, units are defined as a living  		environment belonging to a tenant(s) that includes a full bathroom within the  		unit including water closet, lavatory, tub or shower bathing unit and access to  		facilities and equipment for the preparation and storage of food. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Each agency will develop its own admission criteria but the regulations  		do not allow the agencies to impose unreasonable restrictions and screen out  		people whose needs may be met by the agency. Assisted living services may be  		provided to residents with chronic and stable health, mental health and  		cognitive conditions as determined by a physician or health care practitioner.  		</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Services may only be provided by organizations licensed as an assisted  		living services agency. Nursing services are listed in the regulations and  		include client teaching, wellness counseling, health promotion and disease  		prevention, medication administration and delegation of supervision of  		self-administered medications and provision of care and services to clients  		whose conditions are chronic and stable. </p>
<p>Registered nurses may also perform quarterly assessments, coordination,  		orientation, training and supervision of aides. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The Health and Education Facilities Authority provides loans for the  		development of assisted living settings. As yet, no specific program has been  		developed to subsidize services for low income residents of assisted living.  		</p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>The regulations allow for administration of medications by licensed  		staff. Assisted living aides may supervise the self-administration of  		medications which includes reminding, verifying, and opening the package. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>ALSAs must have at least 1 RN and an on-site supervisor 20 hours a week  		for every 10 or fewer RNs and aides and a full time supervisor for every 20 RNs  		and aides. A sufficient number of aides must be available to meet residents'  		needs. All aides must be certified Nurses Aides or Home Health Aides and  		complete 10 hours of orientation and one hour of in-service training every 2  		months. </p>
<p>Twenty four awake staff are not required since the needs will vary among  		managed residential communities. However, 24 hour staffing could be required if  		indicated by resident plans of care. An RN must be available on-call 24 hours a  		day. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3><a name="FL" id="FL">Florida</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>Legislation was passed in 1991 that authorized the delivery of Extended  		Congregate Care (ECC) in Adult Congregate Living Facilities (ACLFs) to promote  		the availability of appropriate services for elderly and disabled persons in  		the least restrictive and most homelike environment to encourage the  		development of facilities which promote dignity, individuality, privacy and  		decision-making ability. The law specifies that regulations governing these  		facilities shall be sufficiently flexible to allow facilities to adopt policies  		which enable residents to age in place when resources are available to meet  		their needs and accommodate their preferences. ACLFs may provide extended  		congregate care to residents. </p>
<p>Providers must receive ACLF and ECC licenses. The ECC license sets  		higher requirements for units and services than the ACLF license alone. </p>
<p>Both the authorizing statute and the regulations include a philosophy  		that emphasizes resident autonomy. Facilities with both licenses must provide  		opportunities for residents to make personal decisions and choices, and to  		participate in developing a care plan. The residence must also develop policies  		which allow residents to age-in-place, maximize independence, dignity, choice  		and decision-making. </p>
<p>Legislation changing the name of the ACLF program to assisted living is  		pending before the state legislature. A number of other legislative proposals  		are pending that would extend the range of allowable services, require a test  		for administrators, set requirements for specialized Alzheimers' programs, and  		increase fire safety requirements (require sprinklers). Amendments to the  		regulations, which were initially promulgated in 1992, were published January  		31, 1995. The revised regulations are expected to be effective by May 1995.  		</p>
<p>Approximately 1800 facilities are licensed as ACLFs of which 120 have an  		ECC or limited nursing service license and are eligible to participate in the  		state's assisted living Medicaid waiver program. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>"Adult congregate care facility means any building or buildings, section  		of a building or distinct part of a building, residence, private home, boarding  		home, home for the aged or other place, whether operated for profit or not,  		which undertakes to provide through its ownership or management, for a period  		exceeding 24 hours, housing, food service, and one or more personal services  		for four or more adults, not related to the owner or administrator by blood or  		marriage, who require such services; or to provide extended congregate care,  		limited nursing services, or limited mental health services." </p>
<p>"Extended congregate care license: a specialized license which is issued  		to facilities which have met the basic licensure provisions of (ACLFs). </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>ACLFs providing extended congregate care must provide private rooms or  		apartments, or semi-private room or apartment shared with a roommate of choice,  		with a lockable entry door. Facilities that provide shared bathrooms must have  		one bathroom shared by no more than four residents. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p><b>Admission</b> The regulations for "admissions" are very detailed. New  		residents must be able to perform ADLs with supervision or assistance; do not  		require 24 hour nursing supervision; are capable of taking their own medication  		or may require administration of medication and the facility has licensed staff  		to provide the service; do not have bed sores or stage 2, 3, or 4 pressure  		ulcers, are able to participate in social activities; capable of  		self-preservation; is not bedridden; non-violent; and does not require 24 hour  		mental health care. </p>
<p><b>Continued residency</b> Additional criteria affect continued  		residency. Residents may not be retained if they develop a need for 24 hour  		supervision; become bedridden for more than 14 days, become totally dependent  		in 4 or more ADLs (exceptions for quadraplegics, paraplegics and victims of  		muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and other neuro-muscular diseases if the  		resident is able to communicate their needs and do not require assistance with  		complex medical problems). Residents may stay if they develop stage 2 pressure  		sores but must be relocated for stage 3 and 4 pressure sores. Residents who are  		medically unstable, become a danger to self or others or experience cognitive  		decline to prevent simple decision making may not be retained. </p>
<p>This lengthy list of resident conditions which may and may not be  		treated may be replaced by using the Medicare skilled nursing definition to  		establish the admission and retention policy. </p>
<p>The original law emphasized aging-in-place and the regulations included  		a requirement that residents must reside in the facility 90 days prior to the  		need for ECC services. This prevented people from moving in to an ACLF who  		needed the services upon move in. Modifications to the requirement are pending  		in the legislature. </p>
<p>To receive services under the Medicaid waiver, tenants must be 60 years  		of ago or older and meet one of the following criteria: </p>
<ul><li>Require assistance with 4 or more ADLs or three ADLs plus supervision  		  or administration of medications; </li>
<li>Require total help with 1 or more ADLs; </li>
<li>Have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease or another type of dementia  		  and require assistance with 2 or more ADLs; </li>
<li>Have a diagnosed degenerative or chronic medical condition requiring  		  nursing services that cannot be provided in a standard ACLF; </li>
<li>Are Medicaid eligible, awaiting discharge from a nursing home but  		  cannot return to a private residence because of a need for supervision,  		  personal care, periodic nursing services or a combination of the three. </li>
</ul><h4>Services</h4>
<p>The facility must describe the personal, supportive and nursing services  		to be made available. Facilities may provide limited nursing services (eg.,  		medication administration and supervision of self-administration, applying  		heat, passive range of motion exercises, ice caps, urine tests, routine  		dressings that do not require packing or irrigation and others), intermittent  		nursing services (eg., change of colostomy bag and related care, catheter care,  		administration of oxygen, routine care of an amputation or fracture,  		prophylactic and palliative skin care); counseling emotional support,  		networking, assistance securing social and leisure services, shopping, escort,  		companionship, family support, information and referral, transportation  		assistance developing and implementing self-directed activities. In addition,  		facilities are to provide ongoing medical and social evaluation, dietary  		management, and medication administration. </p>
<p>Facilities <b>may not</b> provide oral or nasopharyngeal auctioning,  		assistance with tube feeding, monitoring of blood gasses, intermittent positive  		pressure breathing therapy, intensive rehabilitation services for a stroke or  		fracture or treatment of surgical incisions which are not clean and free from  		infection and any treatment requiring 24 hour nursing supervision. </p>
<p>The Medicaid waiver includes the following services for recipients in  		ECC settings: personal care, homemaker, attendant and companion, medication  		administration and oversight, therapeutic social and recreational programming,  		physical, occupational and speech therapy, intermittent nursing services,  		specialized medical supplies, specialized approaches for behavior management  		for people with dementia, emergency call systems and case management. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>A total of $2.3 million was approved in 1994 for 220 Medicaid Home and  		Community Based Services Waiver slots as a pilot program. The SSI benefit is  		$586 a month. The program reimburses providers $750 a month for services for a  		total payment of $1336 less the personal needs allowance. An evaluation of the  		program will be done to examine levels of need and developed a tiered rating  		system as appropriate. </p>
<p>To be eligible for the program, recipients must be an SSI recipient,  		have income under 300% of the federal SSI benefit or, for aged and disabled  		applicants, have income under 90% of the federal poverty level. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Medications may be administered by staff within the scope of their  		license. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Facilities are allowed to establish their own staffing plan based on the  		amount and type of services needed by residents and reflected in resident plans  		of care. Certified nursing assistants and certified home health aides must  		receive training in the concepts and requirements of extended congregate care.  		</p>

<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>A multi-member task force was created by House Concurrent Resolution 377  		to make recommendations and assisted living and to explore the use of Medicaid  		waivers to support low income residents in assisted living. The report was  		issued in December 1994 and legislation implementing some of the  		recommendations was filed for consideration by the legislature in 1995. Members  		of the task force made site visits to facilities in Oregon and Washington. The  		report recommended that the Department of Health be authorized to develop  		regulations to establish an assisted living program. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>The report recommended that assisted living be defined as a special  		combination of housing, personalized supportive services, and health care  		designed to respond to individual needs. Assisted living promotes choice,  		responsibility, independence, privacy, dignity and individuality and encourages  		the involvement of a resident's family and friends. The setting within an  		assisted living facility is usually a private studio apartment and bath. </p>
<h4>Unit</h4>
<p>The definition emphasizes but would not require that units be configured  		as apartments. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Not described.</p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The report suggested that land policies should be reviewed and  		modification of zoning requirements made to allow existing housing stock to be  		used. State loans and bonds would be made available to at favorable interest  		rates to stimulate development. The report recommended consideration of  		providing a higher level of service in residential care facilities as a means  		of maximizing existing buildings to meet new needs. </p>
<h4>Medication</h4>

<h3><a name="ID" id="ID">Idaho</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>A concept paper has been prepared by the Idaho Residential Care Council  		that outlines a policy for assisted living. The draft paper states that  		assisted living serves people who need assistance with ADLs but not skilled  		nursing care. Assisted living promotes independence and dignity for each  		resident in a home like atmosphere rather than a medical atmosphere. </p>
<p>The paper envisions assisted living as providing care that is less  		intensive than nursing home care and more services than are available in  		independent housing. Licensing would be done in a manner that does not remove  		independence and choice from the resident. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>

<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>The state legislature called for a study of assisted living during the  		summer of 1994. The Interim Study Committee on Health Care and Licensure Issues  		held five meetings and received public testimony. The Committee report, issued  		November 1994, included a proposed definition for assisted living. A motion to  		file le islation authorizing creation of a program based on Oregon and draft  		regulations in Ohio received a 5-4 vote but required 7 affirmative votes to be  		adopted as a recommendation of the Committee. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Proposed: a program approach, within a physical structure, which  		provides or coordinates a range of social and health care services for five or  		more individuals, available on a 24 hour basis, for support of resident  		independence in a residential setting. Assisted living promotes resident  		self-direction and participation in decisions that emphasize choice, dignity,  		privacy, individuality, independence and home-like surroundings.

<p>Chapter 661 of the Acts 1994 directed that state agencies develop a  		definition of assisted living that includes a range of services from in-home  		assistance to facility based care but that excludes supported living program  		operated by the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation; recognizes  		different levels of care with appropriate levels of regulation and provides  		necessary protection for consumers without unduly restricting choice. The  		Bureau of Elder and Adult Services (BEAS) has published a proposed policy with  		an effective date of April 1, 1995. The service based approach will license  		providers of service and limits which organizations may be licensed to provide  		assisted living services. Any organization offering assisted living services  		must be licensed under one of three categories identified in the regulations.  		The new policy does not make changes in current programs or licensure  		categories and simply alter the terms that can be applied to current programs  		as well as introduce a set of principles. </p>
<p>The five principles described in the regulations are: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Assisted living services are personalized and based on the needs and  			 values of the consumer. This means the consumer is involved in decision-making,  			 is informed of risks and has the right to fail. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living services foster independence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living services recognize and respect the dignity and  			 rights of the consumer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living services offer the consumer a choice of services and  			 lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisted living services respect the privacy of the consumer.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Further regulations are to be developed by the Department of Human  		Services to implement consumer protection standards related to provider  		fitness, service contracts and leases, promotion of consumer rights and a  		grievance process, scope of practice and minimum safeguards for life safety,  		food service and sanitation and the minimum standards for accommodations and  		the environment. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted Living Services: personalized supportive services provided to  		functionally and/or mentally impaired adults that assist them in living in the  		residential environment of their choice and take into consideration their  		formal and informal support network. </p>
<p>Assisted living services provider: a provider of assisted living  		services certified by the Department as a Congregate Housing Services Program,  		a residential care facility or as a home health agency. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>Not specified. May be the subject of further regulations.</p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Not specified.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The regulations do not revise the scope of services provided by  		residential care facilities, congregate housing services programs and home  		health agencies. Each provider category provides a different set of services.  		</p>
<p>Congregate housing services: care management services, housekeeping  		services, personal care assistance, transportation and at least one meal a day  		available to consumers in a multiunit residential building. </p>
<p>Residential care services: personal supervision, protection from  		environmental hazards, assistance with activities of daily living,  		administration of medications, diversional or motivational activities, diet  		care and nursing services. </p>
<p>Home health services: in-home provision of professional nursing  		services, physical and/or occupational therapy speech pathology, medical social  		work, nutritionist services and the supervised services of licensed practical  		nurses, home health aides and/or certified nurse assistants providing treatment  		and rehabilitation for illness or disability, aimed at restoring or maintaining  		independent functioning. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>Assisted living would be financed through existing program. No new  		sources of funding are provided. </p>

<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>There are several housing with supportive services programs that operate  		in the state. In 1976, the Office on Aging began the Sheltered Housing program,  		a support services program for frail elderly residents in HUD subsidized senior  		apartment buildings. In 1986, Sheltered Housing (now known as Senior Assisted  		Housing) was expanded to group homes for the elderly which provides services to  		4-15 residents in a group setting. In 1993, the Office on Aging was approved  		for Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver to serve resident in  		Group Senior Assisted Housing (GSAH) facilities. </p>
<p>The Department of Health and Hygiene regulates large facilities serving  		16 or more residents in non-apartment settings. While this category is  		regulated as domiciliary care, some facilities advertize themselves as assisted  		living. Some private market apartment models that offer support services  		operate without state regulation. State agencies are currently reviewing the  		array of models to determine how assisted living should be defined and  		regulated. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Senior Assisted Housing is a residential program that combines housing  		and support services for seniors, who are at least 62 years old, who need daily  		help with activities of daily living in order to remain in the community. </p>
<h4>Units</h4>
<p>The multi-family SAH program operates in 43 senior apartment buildings  		throughout the state, serving over 900 people. There are over 1400 residents  		living in 175 certified GSAH facilities. Group facilities offer private or  		semi-private bedrooms and residents share common areas of the home. Many group  		home residents (about half) have some form of dementia. Although some group  		facilities have been developed in former convents, school buildings or newly  		constructed buildings, most facilities are developed using existing housing  		stock. The conditions of participation require that buildings meet all state  		and local laws governing the physical plant, including fire accessibility and  		safety standards. To offer assisted living services, providers must be  		certified annually by the Maryland Office on Aging. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Required services include daily meals, housekeeping, laundry and  		assistance with personal care. The group home model also requires 24-hour on  		site supervision. Optional services include assistance with medication  		administration, recreational and social activities of a non-therapeutic nature,  		assisting with transportation arrangements, and helping participants access  		medical care. Under the Medicaid waiver, services in group homes have been  		augmented to include environmental modifications, assistive equipment and  		behavior consultation services, and Senior Center Plus, a social day care  		program. </p>
<p>The Medicaid waiver component of the program is unique in that it  		provides support for environmental modifications. The program will pay two  		thirds of the modification costs and the assisted living provider pays the  		remaining third. Reimbursement for assistive equipment must be pre-authorized  		by the Area Agency on Aging case manager and approved by the state Office on  		Aging. Reimbursement for assistive equipment is limited to $1000 per  		participant during a 12 month period and reimbursement for environmental  		modifications is limited to $3000 per participant over a lifetime. Assistive  		equipment and environmental modifications reimbursements are divided among the  		participants affected. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>In both models, eligible low income residents may be subsidized through  		state general funds. Subsidies are provided on a sliding scale based on income.  		In the group home program, services for nursing home eligible residents may  		also be covered under the Office on Aging's Medicaid waiver. </p>
<p>Service providers determine the cost of care in both models. In the  		multi-family model, the average monthly fee for services is $474, with an  		average monthly subsidy of $151 per resident. Rates for group homes range from  		$1000 to $2500 a month. The state subsidy is capped at $550 a month in  		non-waiver group homes. Participants pay the difference between the state  		subsidy and the monthly fee. The monthly fee is capped at $1200 for residents  		determined eligible under the GSAH Medicaid waiver. Waiver eligible residents  		pay 20% of the monthly fee for room and board. </p>
<h4>Medication assistance</h4>
<p>The Medicaid waiver allows approved providers, under the supervision of  		a registered nurse, to administer medications to waiver clients. Only persons  		who have successfully completed medication management training provided by the  		Office on Aging may administer medications. A registered nurse, under contract  		with the Area Agency on Aging, is required to monitor Medicaid approved homes  		at least every 45 days to assure that medications are administered properly.  		</p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>In both SAH models staff must be adequate to provide the required  		services. Under the Medicaid waiver at least 1 staff person must be on duty at  		all times for every 8 residents. Providers may be a physician, nurse or persons  		with three years of applicable experience. </p>

</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>Chapter 354 (Acts of 1994) was signed into law in early January 1995 and  		creates a process for the <b>certification</b> of assisted living facilities by  		the Executive Office of Elder Affairs. The law provides that the regulations  		"shall be sufficiently flexible to allow assisted living residences to adopt  		policies and methods of operation which enable residents to age-in-place." To  		be certified, residences must submit information such as the number of units  		and number of residents per unit, location of units, common spaces and egress  		by floor; base fees to be charged; services to be offered and arrangement for  		delivering care; number of staff to be employed and other information required  		by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs. The process does not require  		licensing or review of the building which must comply with state and local  		building codes. The buildings are considered residential use for applying  		codes. </p>
<p>Throughout the state, 42 assisted living residences (1636 units) are  		operating, 24 residences (1321 units) are under development. All 66 residences  		expect to become certified under the new legislation. The Massachusetts Housing  		Finance Agency (MHFA) and the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency (MIFA)  		provide loans for assisted living. The MHFA "Elder CHOICE program is designed  		to support development of appropriate housing and ADL assistance for frail  		elders. The agency's RFP says that assisted living offers a supportive  		residential environments which maximizes the ability of elders to live  		independently and reduces the need for costly institutionalization. The  		Medicaid Group Adult Foster Care program has certified 7 programs and 8 more  		applications are expected to be approved. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted living residence, any entity, however organized, whether  		conducted for profit or not for profit, which meets all of the following  		criteria: </p>
<blockquote><p>Provides room and board; provides, directly by employees of the entity  		  or through arrangements with another organization which the entity may or may  		  not control or own, assistance with activities of daily living for three or  		  more adults residents who are not related by consanguinity of affinity to their  		  care provider and; collects payments or third party reimbursements from or on  		  behalf of residents to pay for the provision of assistance with the activities  		  of daily living. </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>Units must be single or double occupancy with lockable doors. New  		construction must provide for private baths. Existing buildings may qualify if  		they provide private half baths and one bathing facility for every three units.  		All residences must provide a kitchenette in each unit or access to cooking  		capacity. The Secretary of Elder Affairs is authorized to waive the  		requirements for bathrooms and bathing facilities when determined to meet  		public necessity and to prevent undue economic hardship as long as the  		residence provides a homelike environment and promotes privacy, dignity,  		choice, individuality and independence. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>The statute does not allow people needing 24 hour skilled nursing  		supervision to be admitted or retained in an assisted living residence. To  		qualify for reimbursement under the Medicaid Group Adult Foster Care program,  		tenants must require daily assistance with at least one ADL and assistance with  		managing medications as documented by a physician and a nursing assessment; be  		at risk of requiring nursing home placement; have been discharged from a  		nursing home; be chronically disabled; and require 24 hour supervision. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Chapter 354 requires that residences all provide or arrange for  		opportunities for socialization and access to community resources; assistance  		with ADLs identified in a plan of care (at a minimum residences must offer  		support for bathing, dressing and ambulation); up to three meals daily;  		housekeeping; self-administered medication management; laundry; and the ability  		to respond to urgent or emergency needs. </p>
<p>Twenty four hour nursing services are not allowed. Skilled services may  		only be provided by a certified home health agency on a part time or  		intermittent basis not to exceed 90 days in a one year period. Medical  		conditions requiring services on a periodic, scheduled basis are also allowed.  		In addition, residents may "engage or contract with any licensed health care  		professional and providers to obtain necessary health care services ... to the  		same extent available to persons residing in private homes." </p>
<p>The MHFA Elder CHOICE program requires, at a minimum, personal care  		(assistance with bathing, dressing, continence, ambulation, toileting, eating  		and transfers); housekeeping and maintenance, laundry, medical monitoring and  		transportation, up to 3 meals a day, 24 emergency response and service  		coordination and case management. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency and the Massachusetts  		Industrial Finance Agency provide loans for the construction of assisted living  		projects. </p>
<p>Services for low income tenants are Subsidized through Medicaid and the  		Executive Office of Elder Affairs. The Medicaid Group Adult Foster Care  		provides an average of $33.70 per day for services and administrative costs.  		The Elder Affairs program provides $817 a month. </p>
<p>Chapter 354 suspends approval of further SSI applications for the higher  		payment standard for assisted living residents pending a study of the economic  		affect of the program. The study has been completed and submitted to the  		legislature for further consideration. The study concluded that Medicaid saves  		$2,398 (average savings weighted by income) a year per recipient through the  		GAFC program and the SSI assisted living payment compared to nursing home  		costs. Based on terminations in the GAFC program, the study estimated that  		nursing home admission would be delayed an average of 8 months for 29% of the  		participants, avoided entirely for 31% of the participants who would die and  		another 39% who may retum to another community option. </p>
<p>The state had received approval from the Social Security Administration  		for a separate payment standard of $920 a month for single individuals in  		assisted living. The regular community payment standard for an aged person  		living alone is approximately $550 a month. The higher standard was approved to  		provide a more realistic level of support for room and board which cannot be  		reimbursed by Medicaid for low income recipients. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Residence staff are allowed to remind residents to take medications,  		open containers, open prepackaged medications, reading the label, observe,  		check dosage against the label and reassure residents that the proper dosage  		has been taken. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>No staffing specific guidelines are included conceming the type and  		number of staff. However, the residence must maintain an ability to provide  		timely assistance to residents and to respond to urgent or emergency needs  		through on site staffing, personal emergency response or other means. Under  		draft regulations, all staff and contracted providers must receive a 6 hour  		orientation which includes the philosophy of independent living, resident bill  		of rights, abuse, safety and emergency measures, communicable diseases,  		communication skills, the aging process and resident health and related  		problerns. Staff providing personal must complete an additional 54 hour  		training Course that includes 20 hours of personal care and 34 hours of general  		training. The personal care component must be taught by an RN. Personal care  		staff will be reviewed twice a year by a qualified nurse. </p>

<h3><a name="MN" id="MN">Minnesota</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Policy Approach</h4>
<p>The Minnesota statute covers home care services which include nursing,  		personal care, therapies, nutritional services, home management and others  		which are delivered in a place of residence. The state has implemented an  		assisted living program through its state funded Alternative Care (AC) program  		and the Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver program. Licensing is  		provided through regulations governing home care providers. </p>
<p>The Alternative Care Program serves nursing home eligible residents  		whose income exceeds Medicaid eligibility levels but who would spend down to  		Medicaid levels within six months if admitted to a nursing home. The HCBS  		waiver covers aged and disabled Medicaid recipients who meet the nursing home  		criteria. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted living services are defined in the home care regulations as  		individualized home care aide tasks or home management tasks provided to  		clients of a residential center in their living units, and provided either by  		the management of the residential center or by providers under contract with  		the management. Individualized means chosen and designed specifically for each  		client's needs, rather than provided or offered to all clients regardless of  		their illness, disability or physical condition. Residential centers are  		defined as a building or complex of buildings in which clients rent or own  		distinct living units. Five classes of home care may be licensed including  		class E, assisted living license which covers the provision of "assisted living  		services to residents of a residential center." </p>
<p>The state's Medicaid waiver defines assisted living services as "up to  		24 hour oversight and supervision, supportive services, home care aide tasks  		and individualized home management tasks provided to residents of a residential  		center living in their own units/apartments with a full kitchen and bathroom. A  		full kitchen includes a conventional stove with an oven, refrigerator, food  		preparation counter space and a kitchen utensil storage compartment. Supportive  		services include socialization (when socialization is part of the plan of care,  		has specific goals and outcomes established and is not diversional or  		recreational in nature), assisting clients in setting up meetings and  		appointments, and providing transportation (when provided by the residential  		center only). Individuals receiving assisted living services will not receive  		both homemaking and personal care services and assisted living services.  		Individualized means that services are chosen and designed specifically for  		each resident's need, rather than provided or offered to all residents  		regardless of their illness, disabilities or physical conditions. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The assisted living policies under the waiver require full apartments  		with kitchens. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Participants for the AC and Medicaid waiver programs must be screened by  		the county preadmission screening team and must meet the nursing home level of  		care criteria. Most residents fall into case mix categories A through D (see  		<a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#tableMN">table</a>). </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The regulations allow the provision of assisted living services which  		include home care aide and home management tasks provided to clients of a  		residential center within living units and provided by management or by  		providers under contract with the center. Home care aide tasks are  		differentiated from home health aide and include assisting with dressing, oral  		hygiene, hair care, grooming and bathing, if the client is ambulatory and has  		no serious illness or infectious disease, preparing modified diets, medication  		reminders, household chores in the presence of technically sophisticated  		medical equipment or episodes of acute illness of infectious disease. </p>
<p>The Medicaid waiver defines services as "supportive services include  		socialization (when socialization is part of the plan of care, has specific  		goals and outcomes established and is not diversional or recreational in  		nature), assisting clients in setting up meetings and appointments, and  		providing transportation (when provided by the residential center only).  		Individuals receiving assisted living services will not receive both homemaking  		and personal care and assisted living services. Individualized means that  		services are chosen and designed specifically for each resident's needs, rather  		than provided or offered to all residents regardless of their illness,  		disabilities or physical conditions. </p>
<p>Under the AC and Waiver programs, residents may also receive home health  		and skilled nursing which are reimbursed separately from the payment for  		assisted living services. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>Rates are negotiated between the client and the provider with limits  		based on the client's case mix classification. Service rates under the AC  		program cannot exceed the state's share of the average monthly nursing home  		payment. The client pays for room and board (raw food costs only - meal  		preparation is covered as a service). The cost of services in addition to  		assisted living services may not exceed 75% of the average nursing home payment  		for the case mix classification. Under the HCBS waiver, rates for assisted  		living services are also capped at the state share of the average nursing home  		payment and the total costs, including skilled nursing and home health aide,  		cannot exceed 100% of the average cost for the client's case mix  		classification. </p>
<p>Statewide maximum FY 94 rates for elderly recipients ranged from $565 a  		month to $1330 a month depending upon the case mix classification. Rates in a  		particular county could be higher or lower than the averages. Rates for  		participants with physical disabilities ranged from $597 to $1361. These rates  		are in effect in 1995 (see <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#tableMN">table</a>). </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Assistance with self-administration is allowed. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>The Department of Health's standards for home care services licenses do  		not apply to the building itself. </p>

</div>
<h4>General Policy Approach</h4>
<p>Regulations took effect in December 1993 governing the provision of  		assisted living services in assisted living residences and comprehensive  		personal care homes. The regulations are intended to promote aging in place in  		homelike, apartment style settings for frail elders. The purpose section of the  		regulations describes the goals of assisted living to "maintain independence,  		individuality, privacy, dignity" in an environment that "promotes resident self  		direction and personal decision making while protecting health and safety."  		</p>
<p>State policy makers intended to allow the provision of assisted living  		in a range of settings, including conventional elderly housing projects.  		Because of conflicts between HUD policy and state licensure, the regulations do  		not apply to conventional housing. Any facility requiring a license is  		considered a medical facility under HUD rules and therefore ineligible for HUD  		subsidies. New Jersey has received a demonstration grant from the  		Administration on Aging to implement an assisted living service model from  		which appropriate standards can be developed. </p>
<p>As of February, 1995, 3 facilities have been licensed and 15 proposal  		were pending. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted living "means a coordinated array of supportive personal and  		health services, available 24 hours per day to residents who have been assessed  		to need these services, including residents who require formal long term care.  		Assisted living promotes resident self direction and participation in decisions  		that emphasize independence, individuality, privacy, dignity and homelike  		surroundings." </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The regulations define an assisted living residence as "a facility which  		is licensed by the Department of Health to provide apartment-style housing and  		congregate dining and to assure that assisted living services are available  		when needed, for four or more adult persons unrelated to the proprietor." Each  		unit must offer one unfurnished room (minimum 150 square feet of clear and  		useable floor area), private bathroom, a kitchenette and a lockable door on the  		unit entrance. The kitchenette must include a small refrigerator, cabinet for  		food storage, sink, and space with outlets suitable for cooking appliances such  		as a microwave, cook top or toaster oven." An additional 80 square feet of  		floor space must be provided in for each additional person occupying a unit.  		</p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Assisted living is not appropriate for people who are not capable of  		responding to their environment, expressing volition, interacting or  		demonstrating independent activity. Each resident receives an assessment and a  		care plan by a registered nurse. The residence may, but is not required to,  		care for people who require 24 hours, seven day a week nursing supervision, are  		bedridden longer than 14 days, consistently and totally dependent in four or  		more ADLs, have cognitive decline that interferes with simple decisions,  		require treatment of stage three or four pressure sores or multiple stage two  		sores, are a danger to self or others or has a medically unstable condition  		and/or special health problems. The admission agreement has to specify if the  		facility will retain residents with one or more of these characteristics and  		the additional costs which may be charged. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The residence must provide or coordinate services. The minimum service  		capacity must include personal care, nursing, pharmacy, dining, activities,  		recreation, and social work services to meet the individual needs of residents.  		</p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>State officials are examining options for financing assisted living for  		low income residents. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Residences are allowed to provide supervision of and assistance with  		self-administration of medications and administration by trained and supervised  		personnel. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>The regulations require at least one awake staff member and one  		additional staff at night and sufficient staffing to provide the services  		indicated by the assessments of resident needs. A registered nurse must be  		available on staff or on call 24 hours a day. Administrators must either be  		licensed as a nursing home administrator or complete an assisted living  		training course approved by the Department of Human Service or equivalent  		training approved by the Department of Health within one year of their  		employment as an administrator. In addition they must complete 10 hours of  		continuing education a year. Personal care assistants must complete a nurses  		aide training course, a homemaker-home health aide training program or  		equivalent training approved by the Department of Health. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3><a name="NY" id="NY">New York</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>In 1991, the state legislature created an assisted living program (ALP)  		and authorized contracting for 4200 units. Since the program substitutes for  		nursing home beds, the nursing home bed need formula was reduced by an  		equivalent amount. By 1994, 63 projects totalling 3500 units had been approved  		through a state contracting process. Fourteen sites are operational. An RFP  		process has been implemented for 700 units in New York City. The budget  		submitted by Governor Pataki would repeal the program as part of a proposed  		Medicaid savings plan. </p>
<p>The state approaches assisted living as a service option in existing  		housing. Assisted living programs must hold a licensed as an adult home or  		enriched housing program (which address housing) and a license as a licensed  		home care services agency or a certified home health agency or a long term home  		health care agency (which address service delivery). </p>
<p>Oversight is spread among a number of state agencies. The Department of  		Health reviews licenses for licensed home care agencies and the Department of  		Social Services licenses adult homes and enriched housing. </p>
<p>Adult homes and enriched housing programs are both licensed under the  		state's adult care facility regulations. Both models serve five or more people  		and provide long term residential care, room, board, housekeeping, personal  		care and supervision. Adult homes represent the state's board and care model  		while enriched housing programs operate in community integrated settings  		resembling independent housing units. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted Living Program (ALP): An entity which is approved to operate  		pursuant to section 485.6(n) of this Title, and which is established and  		operated for the purpose of providing long term residential care, room, board,  		housekeeping, personal care, supervision, and providing or arranging for home  		health services to five or more eligible adults unrelated to the operator. </p>
<h4>Unit</h4>
<p>Adult homes provide single or double occupancy bedrooms and have 1  		toilet and lavatory for every six residents and 1 tub/shower for every 10  		residents. </p>
<p>Enriched housing programs must provide single occupancy units, unless  		shared by agreement, and each unit must include a full bathroom, living and  		dining space, sleeping area and equipment for storing and preparing food.  		Shared units must provide for toilets, lavatory, shower or tub shared by not  		more than 3 residents. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>To receive state reimbursement, tenants must be assessed by a physician  		to need nursing home care. Participants must have stable medical conditions and  		are able to assure self-preservation in an emergency. Operators may not serve  		anyone requiring continual nursing or medical care; is chronically bedfast or  		chairfast and requires lifting equipment or two person assist for transfer; or  		is cognitively, physically or medically impaired to a degree which endangers  		the safety of the resident or other residents. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Adult homes and enriched housing programs can provide supervision,  		personal care, case management, activities and food service under their adult  		care facilities license. To operate as an assisted living program, additional  		services and licenses are needed. The facility may seek a license to provide  		nursing care and therapies or they may contract with a home health agency or a  		long term home health care program. </p>
<p>The capitation rate covers personal care, home health aide, personal  		emergency response, nursing services, physical therapy, occupational therapy,  		speech therapy, medical supplies that do not require prior authorization and  		adult day health care, if needed. </p>
<p>A care plan is jointly developed by the ALP and the CHAA/LTHHP which  		reflects physician's orders and the assessment process. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>Subsidies are available for Medicaid recipients. The service  		reimbursement is set at 50% of the resident's Resource Utilization Group (RUG)  		which would have been paid in a nursing home. The state has created RUG rates  		for 16 geographic areas of the state. There are two groups of RUGs, one for  		health related services and another for skilled services. Payments based on  		RUGs for ALP residents (50% of the amount paid in a nursing home) for the four  		health related categories range from $51.04 to $66.54 a day in New York City to  		$31.07 to $39.53 in northern rural areas of the state. The rate for skilled  		nursing RUGs range from$ 74.57 to $104.88 a day in New York City to $43.85 to  		$60.35 in northern rural areas. </p>
<p>The reimbursement category is determined through a joint assessment by  		the Assisted Living Program and the designated home health agency or long term  		home health care program. The assessment and the RUG category are reviewed by  		the Department of Social Services district office. The residential services  		(room, board and some personal care) is covered by SSI which also varies by  		region. In 1994, the SSI rates were $881 in New York City, Nassau, Suffolk and  		Westchester counties and $851 in the rest of the state. </p>
<h4>Medication</h4>
<p>Assistance with self-administration is allowed including prompting,  		identifying the medication for the resident, bringing the medication to the  		resident, opening containers, positioning the resident, disposing of used  		supplies and storing the medication. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Adult homes must have a case manager and staffing that is sufficient to  		provide the care needed by residents. Staff providing personal care must  		complete a home health aide training course or other examination approved by  		the Department of Health. Adult home staff must provide 3.5 hours of service  		staff time per resident per week for personal care, 1 hour per resident per  		week for housekeeping and 2 hours of food service time per resident per week.  		</p>
<p>Enriched housing programs must staff to provide a total of 6 hours per  		resident per week for housekeeping, personal care and food service which can be  		allocated based on aggregate resident needs. </p>

</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>A 31 member "Steering Team" has made recommendations to the Secretary of  		the Department of Human Resources that would establish assisted living as an  		umbrella concept that includes a variety of models in two basic categories --  		multi-unit independent housing and adult care homes, including family care  		homes. The Team included state and county agencies, advocacy groups, nursing  		home, housing and adult care home providers, legislators and others. The group  		met 9 times between August 1993 and January 1995 and five subcommittees were  		formed that met regularly between meetings. The Team established four goals for  		the model: </p>
<ul><li>assure that adults of all ages and adults with disabilities receive  		  high quality care and services; </li>
<li>protect individuals' safety and well-being; </li>
<li>reserve individual rights and dignity; and </li>
<li>allows diversity in service delivery models. </li>
</ul><p>Quality of care would be assured through the development of outcome  		measures rather than rules that rely on structure and process. The report  		supports passage of legislation creating an assisted living program in 1995 and  		the development of regulations to implement the legislation by 1996. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>The Team's recommendation would define assisted living "as any group  		housing and services program for two or more unrelated adults, by whatever name  		it is called, which makes available, at a minimum, one meal a day and  		housekeeping services and provides personal care services directly or through a  		formal written agreement with one or more licensed home care agencies. Nursing  		services provided to an individual in an assisted living resident may not  		exceed those allowed under Medicare home health regulations. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>Settings in which services are delivered may include selfcontained  		apartment unit or single or shared room units with private or area baths.  		Residential building codes would apply to adult care homes serving 6 or fewer  		residents and institutional codes to adult care homes service more than 6  		residents. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Multi-unit independent models serve residents that are independent  		enough to arrange for the provision of their personal care and will not require  		24 hour supervision. Adult care homes will service a population that is more  		mentally or physically dependent needing 24 hour supervision and assistance  		with personal needs. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>In multi-unit housing, one to three meals would be served and no  		resident monitoring or supervision would be provided by staff of the housing  		provider. In adult care homes, three meals would be provided in adult care  		homes. Personal care would be provided in both settings as well as nursing  		services that do not exceed the Medicare definition. </p>
<p>The mental health system would provide services to personal with  		developmental disabilities and mental health condition in adult care homes.  		</p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The report recommended that the Division of Medical Assistance  		investigate the use of funds to reimburse for personal care and that the  		personal needs allowance either be increased or that personal care supplies be  		included in the standard rate. </p>

</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>Assisted living is viewed as a service in an apartment setting. The  		state reimburses assisted living through its Medicaid Home and Community Based  		Services Waiver and state funded service programs. Licensing is not required  		however, the public welfare statute contains a definition of assisted living.  		While only one provider participates in the programs, state officials note that  		interest from other potential providers has increased. The current site is a  		mixed population site funded by HUD for people with mobility impairments. The  		state assisted living programs provides services to residents in fifteen of the  		twenty apartments. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>An environment where a person lives in an apartment like unit and  		receives services on a twenty four hour basis to accommodate the person's needs  		and abilities and maintain as much independence as possible. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>An apartment setting is required. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Participants in the service programs must have needs that can be met  		through the program. To qualify for services, residents must have impairments  		in 4 ADLs or impairments in 5 IADLs totalling 8 points (see below) or 6 points  		if the person lives alone. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The program provides environmental and personal services to  		participants. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The state has four sources of financing: an HCBS waiver for the aged,  		blind and disabled, an HCBS waiver for people with traumatic brain injuries,  		and two state funded programs - service payment for elderly and disabled and  		the exceptional service payment for the elderly and disabled. The programs pay  		providers a rate based on the care needs of the resident. The maximum rate is  		$50 a day. A point system is used to convert unmet service functional needs to  		a rate (see <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#tableND">table</a>). The total points are multiplied by a  		factor of 8 to obtain a monthly payment rate. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>The state's nurse practice act allows assistance with  		self-administration but not the direct administration except by licensed staff.  		No separate requirement outside the nurse practice act are included. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Must be able to deliver the necessary services required by plans of  		care. </p>

<h3><a name="OH" id="OH">Ohio</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>In July 1993, chapter 3726 was signed that created an assisted living  		program. In April 1994 the Department of Health issued draft regulations and a  		Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Waiver proposal was submitted to  		HCFA. Implementation of the program was planned for July 1, 1994. As the  		process for developing the regulations proceeded, segments of the assisted  		living and nursing home industries expressed concerns about the model and the  		direction of the regulations. An amendment was passed that delayed the  		effective date of regulations pending a review by a special committee  		consisting of 6 legislators, 4 state agencies 4 provider groups (3 nursing home  		and 1 assisted living), the Area Agency on Aging Association, the Ombudsman  		Association, AARP and a taxpayer group. </p>
<p>The task force was created to address opposition to Chapter 3726 and the  		proposed regulations dealing with the unit requirements, the level of services  		provided in assisted living and the medical conditions of tenants. While a  		formal consensus report was not submitted, the governor's budget included  		several proposals contained in the draft report. The budget bill would repeal  		the assisted living statute and create a new category of residential care  		facility to replace the current rest home classification. Residential care  		facilities would be able to provide up to 120 days of skilled nursing services  		with exceptions for special diets, medication administration and dressing  		changes. </p>
<p>The current statute describes a licensing role for the Department of  		Health to regulate the services provided, and general requirements for the  		living unit. The policy focuses on the services rather than the setting which  		must comply with local building codes. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Chapter 3726 defines an assisted living facility as "a multiple unit  		residential facility, other than ... that provides or arranges for skilled  		nursing care for one or more individuals who reside in the facility and are not  		related to the owner or operator of the facility or his spouse as a parent,  		grandparent, child, sibling, niece, nephew or child of an aunt or uncle." </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The current law specifies that the facility must consist of single  		occupancy units (unless shared by choice) containing private cooking, bathing,  		washing, and toilet facilities, has doors that can be locked and individual  		temperature controls, is equipped with automatic sprinkler equipment. The  		facility must be approved by the local building department rather than the  		Health Department. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Assisted living facilities may not admit anyone who requires skilled  		nursing care on a 24 hour a day basis or retain a resident for a period longer  		than is necessary to complete an appropriate transfer. Residents requiring 24  		hours of care for more than 30 days, or have medically complex needs requiring  		constant nursing supervision, assessment, planning or intervention or require  		direct supervision of licensed nursing personnel may not be served. </p>
<p>The statute allows facilities to serve residents requiring skilled care  		for up to 120 days. Exceptions to the 120 day limit allow residents receive  		dressing changes, special diets and medication administration. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The law provides that an assisted living facility must provide or  		arrange for services needed or requested be the resident such as skilled  		nursing care, supervision, personal care services including assistance with  		self-administration of medications, homemaker services, therapies and other  		services specified by the Director of the Department of Health. A home and  		community based services waiver application was submitted, and later withdrawn,  		to HCFA to finance services for Medicaid recipients. The governor's budget  		includes funding for waiver services. A new waiver will be submitted following  		adoption of the budget recommendation. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The budget proposal includes $4.4 million for the Department of Aging to  		develop an assisted living program through a Medicaid Home and Community Based  		Services waiver and to subsidize room and board payments. The Department of  		Aging has developed a five tiered system for determining the level of  		reimbursement (see <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#tableOH">table</a>). Rates will range from $200 to  		$1400 a month. A residential State Supplement of $700 a month will be paid to  		cover room and board costs. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Non-licensed staff may assist with self-administration. Activities  		include reminders, observing, handing medications to the resident, verifying  		the resident's name on the label, removing oral or topical medications from  		containers, applying medication upon request, placing containers with  		medication to the mouth of the resident. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>At least 1 staff member must be on-site at all times. In addition,  		sufficient staff time must be available to meeting a timely manner the  		residents' care, supervisory and emotional needs and reasonable requests for  		service, including ongoing supervision of residents with increased emotional  		needs or presenting behaviors that cause problems for the resident or other  		residents and to properly provide dietary, housekeeping, laundry and facility  		maintenance services and recreational activities. An RN, LPN or physician must  		be on duty when medications are being administered. Staff may be shared with  		other licensed facilities in the same building or in the same lot as long as  		staffing requirements for all facilities are met. </p>

<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>The state has adopted assisted living regulations and policies which  		encourage the use of the arrangement to substitute for nursing homes and to  		offer home-like environments which enhance dignity, independence,  		individuality, privacy, choice and decision making. Facilities are required to  		have written policies and procedures which describe how they will  		operationalize these principles. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>"Assisted living means a program approach, within a physical structure,  		which provides or coordinates a range of services, available on a 24 hour  		basis, for support of resident independence in a residential setting. Assisted  		living promotes resident self-direction and participation in decisions that  		emphasize choice, dignity, privacy, individuality, independence and home-like  		surroundings." </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>Each unit must provide 220 square feet of space, not including a private  		bathroom. Units in pre-existing structures may provide 180 square feet. Units  		must have kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, cooking appliance and space for  		food preparation and storage, individual heat controls, lockable doors and a  		phone jack. Buildings must meet applicable zoning and building codes. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>The regulations specify "move out" criteria that allow residents to  		choose to remain their living environment despite functional decline.  		Facilities may ask residents to leave if the resident's behavior poses an  		imminent danger to self or others, if the facility cannot meet the resident's  		needs or services are not available, non-payment or the resident has a  		documented pattern of non-compliance with agreements necessary for assisted  		living. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>An interdisciplinary team conducts an assessment with each resident and  		develop a plan that responds to their needs. Services include assistance with  		ADLs, nursing assessment, health monitoring, routine nursing tasks, medication  		assistance, housekeeping, three meals a day, laundry, and opportunities for  		socialization that utilizes community resources. </p>
<p>Each facility must also have the capability to provide or arrange for  		medical and social transportation, ancillary services for medically related  		care, barber/beauty services, social/recreational, hospice, home health and  		maintenance of a personal financial account for residents. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The state provides five levels of payment for Medicaid recipients  		residing in assisted living settings. Residents must meet the nursing home  		level of care criteria. The levels are assigned based on a service priority  		score determined through an assessment (see <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#tableOR">table</a>  		below). ADLs include eating/nutrition, dressing/grooming, bathing/personal  		hygiene, mobility, bowel and bladder control and behavior. </p>
<p>Service priority ratings are assigned based on the number and type of  		impairments in ADLs. Service priority A is assigned to people who are dependent  		in 3-6 ADLs; priority B dependent in 1-2 ADLs (see <a href="assisted-living-policy-and-regulation-state-survey.html#tableOR">table</a>). </p>

<h3><a name="RI" id="RI">Rhode Island</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>The state's regulations use the term "residential care and assisted  		living facilities." Only 45 homes are licensed and about half were previously  		licensed as ICFs. The program is equivalent to board and care. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Rhode Island regulations define "residential care and assisted living  		facility means a publicly or privately operated residence that provides  		personal assistance lodging and meals to two or more adults who are unrelated  		to the licensee or administrator, excluding however, any privately operated  		establishment or facility licensed pursuant to" other statutes. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The regulations allow double occupancy. Older homes have shared baths  		while newer buildings provide private baths in each unit. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Two levels of licensing are allowed. Level I cares for residents who are  		capable of self-preservation, take their own medications and are ambulatory.  		Level II residents are not capable of self-preservation, need nursing  		assistance to take medications and require assistance with personal hygiene.  		Residents needing skilled care cannot be served. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>

<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>Assisted living services are included in the state's Medicaid Home and  		Community Based Services waiver program. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted living/residential care services provide a 24 hour living  		arrangement for persons who, because of a physical or mental limitation, are  		unable to continue independent functioning in their homes. Services are  		provided in personal care facilities licensed by the Texas Department of Human  		Services (DHS). In effect the rules recognize 3 types of units provided in  		licensed personal care facilities. Nursing facility waiver participants are  		responsible or their room and board costs and, if applicable, copayment for  		assisted living/residential care services. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The program guidelines differentiate between assisted living apartments,  		residential care apartments and residential care non-apartments. Assisted  		living apartments must provide each participant a separate living unit to  		guarantee their privacy, dignity and independence. Units must include  		individual living and sleeping areas, a kitchen, bathroom and adequate storage.  		Units must provide 220 square feet, excluding bath, but units in remodeled  		buildings may provide 160 square feet. Double occupancy units may be provided  		if requested. </p>
<p>Residential care apartments must be double occupancy with a connected  		bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom area providing a minimum of 350 square per  		client. Indoor common space used by residents may be counted in the square  		footage requirement. Kitchens must be equipped with a sink, refrigerator,  		cooking appliance (stove, microwave, built-in surface unit) that can be removed  		or disconnected and space for food preparation. </p>
<p>Residential care non-apartments is a licensed personal care facility  		which do not meet either of the above definitions. These units may be double  		occupancy units in free standing buildings that have 16 or less beds. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Not stated.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Services that must be available provided include personal care,  		administration of medications, home management (housekeeping), escort, 24 hour  		supervision, social and recreational activities and transportation. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The Medicaid waiver provides $29.39 a day for services in single  		occupancy assisted living apartments, $22.96 a day for double occupancy  		residential care apartments and $18.99 a day for residential care  		non-apartments. The SSI payment for room and board is $11.88 a day. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>The waiver rules allow the direct administration of all medications or  		the assistance with or supervision of medication. </p>

</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>The state's regulations establish assisted living as a place of  		residence where elderly and disabled persons can receive 24 hour individualized  		personal and health related services to help maintain maximum independence,  		choice, dignity, privacy, and individuality in a home-like environment. The  		rules provide for 3 levels of license: large facilities, 15 or more residents;  		small facilities 6-16 residents; and limited capacity facilities, up to 5  		residents. </p>
<p>Program rules have been approved and rules for construction of assisted  		living facilities were approved March 17th and were expected to be effective by  		July, 1995. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>HB 201, which was passed during the 1994 legislative session, defines  		assisted living as "a residential facility with a homelike setting that  		provides an array of coordinated supportive personal and health care service,  		available 24 hours per day, to residents who have been assessed under division  		rule to need any of these services. Each resident shall have a service plan  		based on the assessment, which may include: specified services of intermittent  		nursing care, administration of medication, and supportive services promoting  		residents' independence and self-sufficiency. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>A residential living unit means a one or two bedroom unit which may also  		include a bathroom and additional living space. A maximum of two residents may  		occupy a resident living unit. Additional living space means a living room,  		dining space and kitchen facilities, or a combination of these facilities, in a  		resident living unit. Units must have lockable doors and tenants must have a  		key. </p>
<p>Facilities providing only bedrooms must provide a toilet and lavatory  		for every four residents and a bathtub or shower for every 10 residents.  		Occupancy units without additional living space must be a minimum of 120 square  		feet for single occupancy units and 200 square feet for double occupancy units.  		Bedrooms in units that do provide additional living space must be at least 100  		square feet for single units and 160 square feet for double units. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Facilities may not serve anyone who requires inpatient hospital care or  		24 hour continual nursing care that will last more than 15 calendar days or  		people who cannot evacuate without physical assistance of one person. Written  		acceptance, retention and transfer policies are required of each facility.  		Facilities may not accept anyone who is suicidal, assaultive or a danger to  		self or others, has active tuberculosis or other communicable disease that  		cannot be adequately treated at the facility or on an outpatient basis or may  		be transmitted to other residents through general daily living. </p>
<p>Physician's statements are required that document the resident's ability  		to function in the facility and describing the following information: whether  		the resident's health condition is stable, free from communicable disease,  		allergies, diets, current prescribed medications with dose, route, time of  		administration and assistance required, physical or mental limitations and  		activity restrictions. </p>
<p>The rules allow pets to be kept if permitted by local ordinances. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Facilities must provide personal care, food service, housekeeping,  		laundry, maintenance, activity programs, medication administration and  		assistance with self-administration and arrange for necessary medical and  		dental care. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The state plans to amend its Medicaid Home and Community Based Services  		Waiver in May to add assisted living as a service. Rates for the program have  		not been developed. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Facilities are allowed to provide medication administration by licensed  		staff and assistance with self-medication by unlicensed staff (opening  		containers, reading instructions, checking dosage against the label, reassuring  		the resident that the correct dosage was taken and reminding residents that a  		prescription needs to be refilled. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Direct care staff are required on-site 24 hours a day to meet resident  		needs as determined by assessments and service plans. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3><a name="VA" id="VA">Virginia</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>The state is revising its adult care residence (ACR) regulations to  		include assisted living which is described as a service in ACRs rather than a  		setting or a building. The summary is based on the draft regulations dated  		6/94. The regulations are expected to be finalized and implemented by July,  		1995. A Medicaid HCBS waiver will be sought to provide funding for Medicaid  		recipients when the regulations are finalized. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Assisted living means a level of service provided by an adult care  		residence for adults who may physical or mental impairment, and require at  		least a moderate level of assistance with activities of daily living. Moderate  		level of assistance means dependency in two or more ADLs. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The regulations do not change the unit requirements. ACRs may offer  		single rooms (minimum 100 square feet for newer buildings) or multiple  		occupancy rooms (80 square feet per occupant). Facilities must provide one  		toilet and wash basin for every seven people and one bath tub for every ten  		people. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>ACRs cannot admit or retain residents with the following conditions or  		needs: </p>
<ul><li>Ventilator dependent </li>
<li>Dermal ulcers (III or IV) </li>
<li>Intravenous therapy or injections directly into the vein. </li>
<li>Airborne infectious disease in a communicable state. </li>
<li>Psychotropic medications without an appropriate diagnosis and  		  treatment plan. </li>
<li>Nasogastric tubes/gastric tubes. </li>
<li>Individuals who present a danger to themselves or others. </li>
<li>Individuals requiring continuous nursing care. </li>
<li>Individuals whose physician certifies that placement is no longer  		  appropriate. </li>
<li>Individuals who require maximum physical assistance as documented by  		  an assessment. </li>
<li>Individuals whose health care needs cannot be met in the specific  		  ACR. </li>
</ul><p>Public residents must have an assessment completed by a case manager.  		Assessments for private pay residents may be completed by a case manager, an  		independent private physician, or an employee of the facility who meets the  		qualifications of a case manager and assessments by facility workers must be  		signed by an independent physician. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The policy offers ACRs the flexibility to develop a program and service  		plan that meets the following criteria: </p>
<ul><li>Meet physical, mental, emotional and psycho-social needs, </li>
<li>Provide protection guidance and supervision; </li>
<li>Promote a sense of security and self worth; and </li>
<li>Meet the objectives of the service plan. </li>
</ul><p>Each facility develops a written program description for prospective  		residents that describes the population to be served and the program components  		and services available. Facilities are permitted but are not required to offer  		all services as long as they have services that are appropriate for the needs  		of residents. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>A service rate of $180 a month to cover personal care services is  		anticipated. Nursing care would not be covered in the rate. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Self-administration of medications is allowed although assistance with  		self-administration is not described in the regulations. Medication  		administration is permitted when licensed staff are available or a medication  		training program approved by the board of nursing has been completed. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Staffing patterns must be appropriate to deliver the services required  		by the residents as described in the plans of care. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3><a name="WA" id="WA">Washington</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>The state initiated its assisted living program as a pilot effort in 1  		site in 1989. A larger demonstration began in July, 1991. Thirty five  		facilities, representing 1200 units had signed contracts as of January 1995 and  		contracts with 14 facilities, with approximately 800 units, were pending. Of  		the 1200 units, 300 are occupied by Medicaid recipients. The Department of  		Aging and Adult Services has budgetary authorization to contract for 1030 state  		funded units. Contracting for new units for Medicaid recipients requires adding  		capacity through new construction or contracting with existing facilities whose  		availability varies with resident turn over rates. State policy limits the  		percentage of units that they will contract for in a facility. </p>
<p>Based on demonstration experience, the Department of Aging and Adult  		Services has developed draft regulations codifying its contract requirements.  		Proposed regulations will establish contract requirements. Until regulations  		are issued, the program requirements are contained in "Assisted Living Facility  		and Service Contract" between the state agency and facilities which must be  		licensed under the boarding home rules. The regulations are expected to be  		finalized by June, 1995. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>"Assisted living means a coordinated array of personal care, health  		services and other supportive services available 24 hours per day to residents  		who have been assessed to need these services. Assisted living promotes  		resident self-direction and participation in decisions that emphasize  		independence, individuality, privacy, dignity, choice and residential  		surroundings." </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>The <b>contract</b> requires that facilities provide a home-like  		environment enhancing the dignity, independence, individuality, privacy, choice  		and decision-making ability of residents. In addition to meeting boarding homes  		rules, the <b>contract</b> requires that units are private, personally  		furnished apartments with an accessible shower, kitchen area, lockable door and  		mail box. Units must be at least 220 square feet and include an interactive  		communication unit or an emergency response system monitored 24 hours a day.  		Kitchens must have a refrigerator and a microwave oven or a two burner stove.  		Each unit must be wired for television and telephone service. Homes built and  		occupied prior to July 1, 1993 may provide a community kitchen rather than  		kitchens within each unit. Existing facilities must provide a minimum of 180  		square feet. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>Residents may be required to move when their needs exceeds the services  		provided through the contract with the state agency; the resident places  		themself or others at an unreasonable risk; the resident has failed to make  		proper payments for services; or the resident requires a level of nursing care  		that is exceeds what is allowed by the boarding home license. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Facilities must develop a negotiated service plan. Services include  		personal care, nursing services, social services, consultation (dietician,  		pharmacist), social/recreational activities, 3 meals, housekeeping and laundry.  		Nursing services are differentiated by licensure category. RNs or LPNs may  		provide insertion of catheters, nursing assessments, and glucometer readings.  		Unlicensed staff may provide the following under supervision of an RN or LPN:  		stage one skin care, routine ostomy care, enema, catheter care, and wound care.  		Unlicensed staff may provide assistance with transfer, mobility, hygiene and  		incontinence. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>Currently, the reimbursement rate for Medicaid recipients who meet the  		nursing home level of care criteria is $47.37 a day that includes the SSI  		payment for room and board of $20.31 a day and a Medicaid payment of $27.06 for  		services. The Aging and Adult Services Division is considering a tiered rate  		structure with three levels for light, moderate and heavy care. The levels will  		reflect number and type of ADL impairments and the extent to which mental  		health and dementia issues affect the intensity of service delivery. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>Medication administration is covered under the boarding homes rules. The  		boarding home rules allow for reminders, assistance with self-administration  		and administration of medications by licensed staff. Changes in the nurse  		practice act to allow nurse delegation is pending in the legislature. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>RNs or LPNs are required to be available on site 5 hours a day, 7 days a  		week and on call 24 hours a day to provide services listed in the negotiated  		service agreements. Other staff must be sufficient to deliver services  		identified in service agreements. New staff must receive 5 hours of training  		and monthly in-service on assisted living values and principles. </p>

<h3><a name="WI" id="WI">Wisconsin</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>An Assisted Living Advisory Committee developed a draft report in 1994  		which described an assisted living model for Wisconsin. The governor has  		submitted legislation as part of the budget proposal to permit development of  		assisted living facilities in the state. In the proposed budget legislation,  		assisted living facilities would be unregulated unless they serve Medicaid  		recipients, in which case, they would have to be certified by the state. If  		passed, rules implementing the legislation would be submitted by December 1,  		1995 to the Department of Administration and to the joint legislative council  		by January 1, 1996. The program would be effective in July 1996. The Department  		is likely to use the recommendations of the advisory committee as a basis for  		developing the certification requirements for facilities seeking reimbursement  		for Medicaid recipients. </p>
<p>The draft report emphasized a philosophy that is the basis of the long  		term care system called RESPECT (relationships, empowerment to make choice,  		services to meet individual needs, physical and mental health services,  		enhancement of participant reputation, community and family participation and  		tools for independence). </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>The budget legislation defines assisted living as a place where five or  		more adults reside that entirely consists of independent apartments, each of  		which has an individual lockable entrance and exit and individual separate  		kitchen, bathroom, sleeping and living areas, and that to a person who  		residents in the place provides not more than 28 hours per week of services  		that are supportive, personal and nursing services. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>As stated in the definition, the proposal will require individual  		apartments. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>State funding would be provided to Medicaid recipients who meet the  		nursing home level of care criteria through the Medicaid Community Options  		Program Waiver (COP-W) and the Community Integration Program (CIP). CIP funding  		is only available when nursing home beds are closed and funding is transferred  		to provide community care to replace the closed capacity. The legislation  		addresses the type of resident who may be served through the 28 hour per week  		cap on services. Tenants needing more care could not be supported in assisted  		living. The regulations that will be developed following passage of the bill  		may address the types of residents who may be served as opposed to the amount  		of reimbursement that will be provided for Medicaid tenants. </p>
<p>The advisory committee report set the 28 hour threshold as the minimum  		service need before a facility could discharge a resident although facilities  		choose to serve residents requiring more than 28 hours of service. </p>
<p>The draft report from the advisory committee recommended that facilities  		be allowed, but not required to, deny admission to people with chronically  		unstable medical conditions which require the availability of a nurse 24 hours  		a day; residents who are unable to recognize danger; residents who require  		hands on assistance with eating or swallowing; require two person transfer; are  		incontinent and cannot self-manage or control their incontinence through a  		reasonable schedule of reminders and/or toileting assistance; ventilator  		dependent; and other conditions. Facilities may care for people with such  		conditions if they are adequately staffed to do so. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The budget legislation sets a limit of 28 hours a week for supportive  		nursing and personal care services. However, the advisory committee concluded  		that assisted living residents may require more care than people in the  		community and the threshold was devised to prevent facilities from discharging  		residents prematurely. The threshold was developed based on an analysis of the  		amount of care required by participants in the state's Community Options  		(Medicaid Waiver) program and the Community Integration Program and reflects a  		higher level of care than the average community client. Rules defining  		supportive services and nursing services will be developed for purposes of  		reimbursement. </p>
<p>The draft report recommended the following as required services:  		housekeeping, laundry, three meals a day, personal care, assistance with  		transferring, mobility assistance, provide or arrange of transportation,  		nursing assessment, evaluation and supervision, medical administration and  		monitoring, nursing care sufficient to meet resident needs within parameters of  		discharge criteria, social and recreational services, psycho-social  		support/intervention, behavior symptom management, opportunities for community  		activities, personal emergency response, information and referral and  		arrangement of other services (financial management, therapy, counseling). </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The bill limits state reimbursement to 85% of the average statewide  		Medicaid nursing home rate. Rates would be established each year by July 1st.  		The Department of Health and Social Services would be responsible for  		developing the rates which have to be approved by the Department of  		Administration. State officials are planning to develop a tiered rate structure  		that reflects varying service needs. Facilities would be reimbursed as waiver  		slots are available. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>The draft report would have allowed assistance with self-administration  		and administration of medications by appropriate staff. </p>
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>The draft report would require that providers submit staffing plans  		which would be approved by the Department of Health and Social Services.  		Minimum standards would require 24 awake staff, full time  		administrator/manager, sufficient staff to meet resident needs as identified in  		plans of care, licensed or certified staff to provide or arrange for nursing,  		dietary evaluation and services and pharmaceutical services. Cross training of  		staff to provide personal care, basic nursing care, cooking, laundry,  		housekeeping and other services would be encouraged. </p>
<div class="bordered-text">
<h3><a name="WY" id="WY">Wyoming</a></h3>
</div>
<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>In 1992, the Director of the Department of Health formed a task force to  		determine how board and care homes can be established as low cost options in  		the continuum of care for the elderly. The task force reviewed who qualifies,  		current and future needs, existing and potential resources and cost  		reimbursement options. The task force included state agencies including the  		housing agency, ombudsman, consumer advocacy (AARP), home health agencies,  		not-for-profit nursing homes, board and care homes, and domiciliary care homes.  		The group's report was issued in October, 1992. In 1993, the legislature passed  		a definition of assisted living that allowed limited nursing care to be  		provided. Regulations were effective in October 1994 that re-name and modify  		the board and care licensure category. Board and care facilities can also be  		licensed as an assisted living facility in order to provide limited skilled  		nursing services and medication administration. </p>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>The statute defines assisted living as "a dwelling operated by any  		person, firm or corporation engaged in providing limited nursing care, personal  		care and boarding home care, but not habilitative care, for persons not related  		to the owner of the facility." Boarding home care means a dwelling or rooming  		house operated by any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of  		operating a home for the purpose of letting rooms for rent and providing meals  		and personal daily living care, but not habilitative or nursing care, or  		personal not related to the owner. </p>
<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>
<p>A maximum of 2 people may share a bedroom. Bedrooms include toilets and  		sinks. One tub and shower rooms are required for every 10 residents. </p>
<h4>Tenant Policy</h4>
<p>The regulations now allow residents who need limited nursing to be  		served. Previously, residents needing skilled nursing had to transfer to a  		nursing facility. However, residents who wander or need wound care, stage II  		skin care, are incontinent or need total assistance with bathing and dressing,  		continuous assistance with transfer and mobility may not be served. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>The facility must describe the services provided and the charges for  		services. Facilities must provide meals, housekeeping, personal and other  		laundry service, assistance with transportation, assistance obtaining medical,  		dental and optometric care and social services, partial assistance with  		personal care, limited assistance with dressing, minor non-sterile dressing  		changes, stage I skin care, infrequent assistance with mobility, cuing for ADLs  		with visually impaired residents and intermittently confused and/or agitated  		residents requiring occasional reminders to time, place and person, care for  		residents who care for their own catheter/ostomy without assistance, care for  		residents who are incontinent but care for themselves, RN assessments and  		medication review, and 24 hour supervision. </p>
<p>Services that may not be provided in assisted living include continuous  		assistance with transfer and mobility, care for residents who cannot feed  		themselves independently, total assistance with bathing or dressing, provision  		of catheter or ostomy care, care of residents who is on continuous oxygen if  		monitoring is required, residents whose medical condition requires more than 7  		days bedrest, residents who wander, stage 11 skin care and beyond, wound care,  		incontinence care. </p>
<h4>Financing</h4>
<p>The task force report recommended that the Wyoming Department of  		Commerce be authorized to make loans to finance the development, remodeling and  		construction of board and care and/or assisted living facilities in underserved  		communities. No subsidies are available for low income residents. </p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>The new regulations allow assistance with self-administration which  		includes but is not limited to reminders, removing from containers, assistance  		with removing caps, and observing the resident take the medication. </p>
