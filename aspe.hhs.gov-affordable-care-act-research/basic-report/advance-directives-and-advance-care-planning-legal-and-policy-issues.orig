<p>Since the mid-1970s, health care advance directives have become the  		central legal tool to make sure ones health care wishes are known in a  		formal way and, it is hoped, followed. However, whether advance directives laws  		can achieve that goal is still very much an open question. This paper provides  		an overview of the evolving legal landscape of end-of-life decision making  		generally, and advance directives specifically, and identifies current  		challenges and opportunities for promoting the goals of advance care  		planning.</p>
<p>A good starting point in understanding this landscape is a realization  		that law and regulation are but one slice of the universe of variables that  		profoundly affect the experience of dying in America. As illustrated in the pie  		chart below, other key variables include institutional innovation, the role of  		financing systems, professional and public education, and professional  		standards and guidelines. All these operate in a larger framework that is  		defined by family, workplace, community life and spirituality. Thus, the  		isolation of law and regulation as a strategy for behavior change requires a  		sense of humility in establishing expectations, lest we overstate the influence  		of law in the human experience of dying. At the same time, although it is but  		one piece, it is perceived as a very powerful variable in the big picture.</p>

</tr></table><p>State <b>statutory law</b> stands out as the predominant feature of the  		legal landscape addressing the use and recognition of advance directives and  		surrogate decision making in general. Though predominant, these laws neither  		create substantive rights nor constitute the exclusive legal authority defining  		our decision making rights and responsibilities. The common law, as well as  		state and federal constitutional law, professional standards, and even custom  		and practice provide the underpinnings of the statutory law and provide the  		foundation for advance directive policy. Sometimes, statutory advance directive  		laws are perceived as the exclusive legal pathway for ensuring ones  		wishes are known and respected. The perception may arise partly because of the  		visibility and perceived authority that official legal forms carry, but also  		because of the tendency of legal advisers to counsel conservatively (i.e., the  		only safe approach to use is the statutory form). The reality is  		that most end-of-life decisions take place through doctor-patient-family  		interactions without the involvement of these legal advance care planning  		tools, and most state advance directive laws assert explicitly that they do not  		pre-empt or change any existing rights regarding health care decision making  		authority or responsibility. Specifically, 33 states with living will, durable  		power of attorney for health care, or combined statutes expressly include  		non-pre-emption language, similar to the following examples from Florida and  		Illinois:<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>The provisions of this chapter are cumulative to the existing law  		  regarding an individual's right to consent, or refuse to consent, to medical  		  treatment and do not impair any existing rights or responsibilities which a  		  health care provider, a patient, including a minor, competent or incompetent  		  person, or a patient's family may have under the common law, federal  		  Constitution, state constitution, or statutes of this state.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nothing in this Act shall impair or supersede any legal right or legal  		  responsibility which any person may have to effect the withholding or  		  withdrawal of death delaying procedures in any lawful manner. In such respect  		  the provisions of this Act are cumulative.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several additional states that lack language similar to the above are  		modeled upon the Uniform Health Care Decisions Act,<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> which provides such broad  		flexibility in the recognition of any form of advance directive -- written and  		oral -- that non-pre-emption language is unnecessary.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> The recognition that advance directive laws  		create no new substantive rights and, instead, provide only elective pathways  		for implementing existing rights is an important threshold principle with which  		to begin a review of the legal landscape, for it sets these laws in their  		proper legal context. The North Carolina statute states this perspective most  		succinctly in its statement of purpose of its advance directive law:</p>
<blockquote><ol type="a"><li>
<p>The General Assembly recognizes as a matter of public policy the  				fundamental right of an individual to control the decisions relating to his or  				her medical care, and that this right may be exercised on behalf of the  				individual by an agent chosen by the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this Article is to establish an additional,  				non-exclusive method for an individual to exercise his or her right to give,  				withhold, or withdraw consent to medical treatment, including mental health  				treatment, when the individual lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to  				make or communicate health care decisions.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>This review starts with a brief synopsis of the common law and  		constitutional underpinnings of advance directive policy in <a href="#common">Section II</a>. <a href="#statutory">Section III</a> examines  		the incremental evolution of the relevant statutory law, followed by an  		analysis of a fundamental paradigm shift in public policy in  		<a href="#paradigm">Section IV</a>. Then, <a href="#POLST">Section V</a> turns  		to a description of a possible next step in evolution, represented by the  		Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) paradigm. Because only a  		minority of the adult population has historically used advance directives,  		<a href="#default">Section VI</a> fills in the rest of the surrogate landscape  		by addressing health care decision making authority where there is no advance  		directive in place. Finally, the federal role in health care advance care  		planning policy is examined in <a href="#federal">Section VII</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="common" id="common">II. COMMON LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL  		UNDERPINNINGS</a></h2>
<p>The common law right to refuse or discontinue medical treatment has been  		established and recognized for decades. Several grounds are asserted for this  		right. Virtually every judicial writing that has addressed the issue starts  		with the well-known tenet expounded by Justice Benjamin Cardozo in the 1914  		case of <i>Schloendorff v. N.Y. Hospital</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to  		  determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an  		  operation without his patients consent commits an assault.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of personal injury law, this right of self-determination  		was recognized first as the common law offense of battery which made any  		offensive, unconsented touching an actionable wrong. From these common law  		roots came two logical extensions -- the doctrine of "informed consent" and a  		corollary right to refuse treatment. </p>
<p>The informed component of consent was not directly  		acknowledged until the California cases of <i>Salgo v. Leland Stanford Jr.  		University Bd. of Trustees</i> in 1957 (a battery case),<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> and <i>Natanson v. Kline</i> in 1960 (a  		malpractice case).<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup>  		Through the 1960s and beyond, informed consent criteria became the subject of a  		great deal of state legislation and litigation.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> Today, the failure to obtain informed  		consent is typically an issue of negligence in medical malpractice claims,  		rather than of battery. </p>
<p>In general terms, informed consent may be described as the  		physicians legal obligation to make adequate disclosures of the  		medically recognized risks, benefits, and alternatives to any proposed  		diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures to allow their patients to make  		informed decisions and to give an informed consent to those  		procedures.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup>  		Another way to describe informed consent -- as well as informed refusals of  		consent -- is through its three requisite elements: informed, voluntary, and  		competent.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Courts and  		legislators have taken differing tacks in defining the nature and depth of  		information required to be disclosed to patients, while the voluntary and  		competent components have remained more consistent in concept, but only in  		concept. In practice, the nuances, variability, and continuum of voluntariness  		and decisional capacity pose everyday challenges to health care  		providers.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Constitutional bases of the right to refuse medical treatment have  		included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>First Amendment religious grounds. Examples have typically involved  			 Jehovah's Witnesses blood transfusion cases.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A right of privacy based primarily on the Due Process Clauses of the  			 Fourteenth Amendment and on state constitutions. Several U.S. Supreme Court  			 cases identify a constitutional right of privacy,<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> although none, not even the decision in  			 Supreme Courts <b>Cruzan</b> decision, discussed below, has extended the  			 right of privacy to include refusals of life-sustaining treatment. But several  			 state appellate level decisions, including the first well-known right to  			 die case of Karen Ann Quinlan in 1976, have upheld decisions to refuse  			 medical treatment on privacy grounds, relying on either or both state and  			 federal constitutions.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A liberty interest, based on the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Cruzan v.  			 Director, Missouri Department of Health</i> -- based its analysis, though  			 provisional, on a constitutional liberty interest.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>In <i>Cruzan</i>, the Court concluded that [t]he principle that a  		competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing  		unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior  		decisions.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> The  		Court declined the opportunity to base its analysis on a constitutional privacy  		right, instead explaining that: "[w]e believe this issue is more properly  		analyzed in terms of a Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest."<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Court also rejected any legal distinction between artificially  		supplied nutrition and hydration and other forms of medical treatment: "[f]or  		purposes of this case, we assume that the U.S. Constitution would grant a  		competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving  		hydration and nutrition."<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> This stance affirmed the view of the  		majority of state courts that had considered the question.</p>
<p>Finally, the Court held that the U.S. Constitution allows states  		considerable leeway in establishing, as Missouri did, a "procedural safeguard"  		for incompetent persons who cannot exercise the right to refuse treatment on  		their own.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup>  		Specifically, it held Missouri's <i>clear and convincing</i> evidence standard  		to be a constitutionally permissible procedural safeguard, although not  		required. Only a few states have been nearly as restrictive as Missouri in  		imposing and defining such a standard.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The overwhelming impact of the <i>Cruzan</i> decision has been to  		solidify the constitutional basis to the right to refuse life-sustaining  		treatment. The acceptance of such a constitutional right reinforces the  		validity and weight of all authentic expressions of patient wishes. The more  		challenging constitutional issue for policy purposes continues to be to what  		extent states can dictate procedural safeguards in the advance care  		planning process, both in the way individuals articulate their wishes and in  		the empowerment of surrogate decision makers. While the latter option was not  		at issue in Cruzan, it was especially noteworthy that the concurring opinion of  		Justice OConner suggested that states may be constitutionally required to  		give effect to decisions made by a surrogate appointed by the  		patient.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>An even more controversial issue related to end-of-life decision making  		confronted the U.S. Supreme Court just a few years after Cruzan -- whether  		there was a constitutional right to physician aid-in-dying for terminally ill  		patients who requested a prescription for lethal drugs. In a pair of decisions  		in 1997, the Court held that neither the Due Process clause nor the Equal  		Protection clause of the 14th Amendment created a constitutional right to  		assisted suicide.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> At  		the same time, the decision did not preclude states from creating by statute,  		as Oregon has done, a process for aid-in-dying.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="statutory" id="statutory">III. THE STATUTORY EVOLUTION OF ADVANCE  		DIRECTIVES</a></h2>
<p>The common law concept of informed consent, buttressed by constitutional  		principles of privacy and liberty have formed the primary platform from which  		advance medical directives spring. But, unlike the process of obtaining  		informed consent for a present treatment, advance directives are usually made  		well before the time a patient can be fully informed of the risks, benefits,  		and alternatives to any proposed diagnostic or therapeutic medical  		procedures.</p>
<p>The first advance directive -- called a <i>living will</i> -- was  		proposed by the Euthanasia Society of America in 1967,<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> and Luis Kutner, a human-rights lawyer from  		Chicago who represented the Society, proposed it as a model in an oft-quoted  		1969 Indiana Law Journal article. Kutner began with the common law and  		constitutional law premise that, The law provides that a patient may not  		be subjected to treatment without his consent and that the individual has  		the right to refuse to permit a doctor to treat him, even if such  		treatment would prolong his live (sic).<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> He continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The patient may not have had, however, the opportunity to give his  		  consent at any point before treatment. He may have become the victim of a  		  sudden accident or a stroke or coronary. Therefore, the suggested solution is  		  that the individual, while fully in control of his faculties and his ability to  		  express himself, indicate to what extent he would consent to treatment. The  		  document indicating such consent may be referred to as a living  		  will, a declaration determining the termination of life,  		  testament permitting death, declaration for bodily  		  autonomy, declaration for ending treatment, body  		  trust, or other similar reference.<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Kutner also analogized the living will to a  		revocable or conditional trust with the patients body as the <i>res</i>,  		the patient as the beneficiary and grantor, and the doctor and hospital as the  		trustees.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> As  		with any trust instrument, the document sets forth the terms for managing the  		<i>res</i>, which in the context of medical care, means the extent to which the  		health care providers should undertake treatment. Both informed consent and  		trust paradigms are characteristic of a legal transactional approach that  		became the paradigm for state advance directive legislation.</p>
<p>The legislative landscape of health care advance directives evolved  		relatively quickly but incrementally, starting with Californias adoption  		of the first living will statute in 1976 (although it used the term  		Directive to Physicians rather than the popular living  		will). The paradigm offered individuals a standardized tool to express  		their wishes about life-sustaining treatment -- usually to withhold or withdraw  		it -- in the event of a terminal condition or permanent unconsciousness, and to  		physicians it offered statutory immunity if they complied with the  		patients wishes in good faith. </p>
<p>One might ask today, more than 30 years later, why physicians would want  		or need immunity to do what the underlying law already seemed to require (i.e.,  		respecting patients wishes). The technological developments in medicine  		during the 1960s and 1970s thrust medicine into a new world where, for the  		first time, it often became difficult to distinguish saving life from  		prolonging suffering and death.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup> A <i>Time Magazine</i> review of the then  		pending Karen Ann Quinlan trial in New Jersey in 1975, captured the tenor of  		the time: </p>
<blockquote><p>[A]lmost all doctors are decidedly uneasy about terminating treatment  		  once it has been started, especially if doing so will mean the certain death of  		  a patient. Many doctors, after all, are taught to regard death as an enemy and  		  to do all they can to defeat it -- or at least to keep it at bay for a while.  		  Many regard "pulling the plug" as an act akin to euthanasia, which is forbidden  		  by both law and the medical code.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Time</i> article ended with broader policy concerns that still  		resonate in todays debates about termination of treatment: </p>
<blockquote><p>For although the Quinlan case concerns mainly the maintenance of life  		  by artificial means, it could, if carried to its logical conclusion, be applied  		  in state hospitals, institutions for the mentally retarded and for the elderly.  		  Such places currently house thousands of people who have neither hope nor  		  prospects of a life that even approaches normality. A decision to remove  		  Karen's life-support system could prompt new suits by parents seeking to end  		  the agony of incurably afflicted children, or by children seeking to shorten  		  the suffering of aged and terminally ill parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was concerns such as these that resulted in a legal model of advance  		care planning that focused on conventional legal formalities or procedural  		protections intended to protect vulnerable populations from harm, specifically  		the premature termination of life due to lack of understanding, or diminished  		capacity of, or undue influence upon, the signor of the living will. </p>
<p>The number of living will laws snowballed during the next ten years, so  		that by the end of 1986, 41 states had adopted living will laws.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> But it was not long before the shortcomings  		of living wills became apparent to policy makers, especially with respect to  		the narrow range of decisions it applied to. Policy makers turned to validating  		and reshaping the use of durable powers of attorney to apply to health  		care.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Powers of attorney existed in the common law as a tool by which a  		principal empowers an agent to act on the principal's behalf. It was originally  		used to delegate authority over property matters. However, in common law, a  		power of attorney was revoked by the incompetency or incapacity of the  		principal. Thus, the common law power had no utility as a planning tool for  		incapacity. In 1954, Virginia enacted the first durable power of  		attorney statute that allowed an agent to continue to act as empowered by a  		power of attorney even after the principal became disabled, incompetent, or  		incapacitated.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup> Other  		states followed suit, and the tipping point came in 1969 when the National  		Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws promulgated a new Uniform  		Probate Code (UPC) that recognized durability if expressly provided for in the  		document. Thereafter, states adopted durable power of attorney laws at a rapid  		pace.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The conventional view of powers of attorney is that they can be used for  		any purpose not contrary to law or public policy of a given state.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup> Their use as a health care  		decision making tool has obvious advantages over the living will. The  		Presidents Commission favored their use for health care decision making  		in their 1983 report, but the Commission also voiced a common concern for the  		potential of abuse inherent in these statutes:</p>
<blockquote><p>These statutes do not have rigorous procedures because they were  		  enacted primarily to avoid the expense of full guardianship or conservatorship  		  proceedings when dealing with small property interests. Adapting them to the  		  context of health care may require that greater procedural safeguards be  		  provided: precisely which safeguards are needed might best be determined after  		  more experience has been acquired.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To address these concerns while encouraging their use, states began  		crafting special durable power of attorney for health care statutes or,  		alternatively, adding proxy provisions to their living will statute. This wave  		of legislation took place roughly from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, with  		California again leading the pack with its 1983 law.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup> By the end of 1988, only 12 states had such  		statutes, but by mid-1993, the District of Columbia and every state, except  		Alabama, had enacted some version of a statutory health care power of care  		statute.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup> Alabama  		followed course in 1997.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A third wave of legislation began in the early 1990s, triggered by a  		growing awareness of unwanted resuscitations of terminally ill patients living  		at home or in hospice, occurring when the expected medical crisis arises and  		someone on the scene calls 911. Absent an out-of-hospital do-not-resuscitate  		(DNR) protocol, emergency medical services personnel are obligated to do  		everything possible to resuscitate a patient whose heart or breathing has  		stopped unless the patient himself or herself refuses help. An advance  		directive does not normally trump that obligation.<sup><font><a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup> To address these unwanted medical  		encounters, states began enacting legislation or regulations in the early 1990s  		to permit seriously ill persons in the community to avoid unwanted  		resuscitation through the use of out-of-hospital DNR orders (sometimes called  		do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders, comfort care orders, cardiopulmonary  		resuscitation (CPR) directives, or other name). These protocols most often  		required the signing of a DNR order by both physician and patient (with many  		states permitting a surrogate to sign) and the use of a specially designed  		identifier to be kept on or near the patient. The protocols, in effect, created  		a kind of hybrid special advance directive and portable doctors order. By  		the end of 1999, 42 states had statewide protocols in place, most frequently  		created by legislation</p>
<p>A fourth wave of legislation was not so much a wave as a slowly rising  		tide, going as far back as the 1960s and continuing to the present.  		Unlike the advance directive waves, this trend addresses the other side of the  		coin -- how decisions are to be made <i>in the absence of an advance  		directive</i>. An awareness that the great majority of Americans were not  		utilizing advance directives fueled interest in this subject.<sup><font><a href="#note42">42</a></font></sup> As is still the case today,  		most decisions relating to end-of-life care for persons lacking decisional  		capacity were made without the guidance or authority of a health care advance  		directive. State law frequently failed to identify who, in the absence of an  		appointed agent or guardian, was authorized to make decisions in these  		instances.</p>
<p>Default surrogate consent or family consent laws provide an answer to  		that question. These exist is some 40 states and the District of Columbia,  		although they vary significantly in breadth and depth.<sup><font><a href="#note43">43</a></font></sup> All create a list of permissible surrogates,  		usually starting with spouse and a next-of-kin priority list. Some limit  		surrogates to fairly close relatives. Iowa, for example, authorizes ones  		spouse, followed by an adult child, a parent, and adult sibling.<sup><font><a href="#note44">44</a></font></sup> Others extend to any adult relative with no  		limitation of degree.<sup><font><a href="#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Seventeen states include "close friend" or its equivalent in the list of  		permissible surrogates, usually at or near the end of the order of  		priority.<sup><font><a href="#note46">46</a></font></sup> Arizona  		additionally includes "patient's domestic partner," as an authorized surrogate  		for some health decisions, although the definition of close friend may be broad  		enough to encompass domestic partner in other states.<sup><font><a href="#note47">47</a></font></sup></p>
<p>These laws differ, in part, according to the kind of statutory context  		in which they emerged. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Some were included in <i>informed consent</i> statutes enacted in  			 the 1960s and 1970s.<sup><font><a href="#note48">48</a></font></sup>  			 These laws provided for family consent to treatment primarily as a way to  			 ensure <i>access</i> to care. They were not enacted with refusals of treatment  			 especially in mind, nevertheless, are applicable given the conceptual unity of  			 consent and refusal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some <i>living will</i> statutes include family consent authority,  			 but since these statutes are typically limited to patients in <i>terminal  			 conditions</i> or in permanent unconsciousness and to decisions about  			 life-sustaining treatment, their application to the full range of health care  			 decisions may be in question.<sup><font><a href="#note49">49</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some are <i>decision-specific</i> laws, such as New York's narrow  			 family consent provision that deals <i>only</i> with DNR orders.<sup><font><a href="#note50">50</a></font></sup> A few other states have enacted family  			 consent provisions specific to medical research consent.<sup><font><a href="#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several states have included family/surrogate consent within  			 <i>comprehensive</i> state health decisions statutes, as explained  			 below.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These laws vary significantly in their scope of authority and other  		limitations, which will be discussed in <a href="#default">Section VI</a>  		below.</p>
<p>A fifth and most important wave of legislation began as a merging of the  		separate health care decisions acts states had already enacted. This was  		driven, in part, by the publics lack of understanding these legal tools  		and their lack of use. Most estimates of completion rates in the early  		1990s hovered around 20 percent or less.<sup><font><a href="#note52">52</a></font></sup> A substantial lack of awareness and  		misunderstanding of advance directives persisted.<sup><font><a href="#note53">53</a></font></sup></p>
<p>New Jersey enacted the first combined statute in 1991, merging the  		living will (called an instruction directive) and the durable power  		of attorney for health care (called a proxy directive) into a  		single advance directive for health care."<sup><font><a href="#note54">54</a></font></sup> By the beginning of 2000, some 16 states had  		comprehensive or combined advance directive statutes, which at a minimum,  		combined living wills and proxies in the same law.<sup><font><a href="#note55">55</a></font></sup> By 2002, 20 states had combined  		statutes.<sup><font><a href="#note56">56</a></font></sup> By early  		2007, the number had inched up to 25. The more comprehensive of these statutes  		also recognize the authority of default surrogate decision makers in the  		absence of an advance directive and encourage, or at least provide the option,  		of combining organ donation instructions in ones directive.<sup><font><a href="#note57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The primary model for a flexible combined advance directive and default  		surrogate law has been the <i>Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act</i>.<sup><font><a href="#note58">58</a></font></sup> The <i>Uniform Act</i> was  		promulgated as a national model by the National Conference of Commissioners on  		Uniform State Laws in 1993, and recognized by the ABA in 1994. The Act  		establishes very simple rules for recognizing almost any kind of written or  		oral statement as an advance directive. Even unwitnessed documents are valid  		under the Uniform Act. However, states that have adopted the <i>Uniform Act</i>  		have almost always added more to the Acts baseline  		requirements.<sup><font><a href="#note59">59</a></font></sup> Indeed,  		all states that have adopted it have added at least a witnessing requirement.  		The Act provides a comprehensive, sample form with options for instructions,  		appointment of an agent, organ donation, an option to name a primary physician,  		and it recognizes default surrogates in the absence of an advance  		directive.</p>
<p>The federal legislative role in the above evolution of advance  		directives has been minimal. The primary congressional foray into this subject  		is the Patient Self-Determination Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget  		Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990.<sup><font><a href="#note60">60</a></font></sup> The Act was a fairly modest amendment to  		federal Medicare and Medicaid law, but it was hoped that it would have an  		effect on the way most adults make and plan for health care decisions. It also  		legislatively affirmed the use of the term advance directive. At  		its heart, it is an information and education mandate. It does not create or  		change any substantive right to health care decision making. Rather, it  		requires all Medicare and Medicaid provider organizations (specifically,  		hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospices, and  		prepaid health care organizations) to do five things:</p>
<ol><li>"provide written information" to patients at the time of admission  		  concerning "an individual's right under state law (whether statutory or as  		  recognized by the courts of the state) to make decisions concerning such  		  medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical  		  treatment and the right to formulate advance directives;"</li>
<li>"maintain written policies and procedures" with respect to advance  		  directives (e.g., living wills and health care powers of attorney) and to  		  "provide written information" to patients about such policies;</li>
<li>"document in the individual's medical record whether or not the  		  individual has executed an advance directive;"</li>
<li>"ensure compliance with the requirements of state law (whether  		  statutory or as recognized by the courts of the state) respecting advance  		  directives at facilities of the provider or organization;" and</li>
<li>"provide (individually or with others) for education for staff and  		  the community on issues concerning advance directives."<sup><font><a href="#note61">61</a></font></sup></li>
</ol><p>Moreover, the Act specifically prohibits providers from any form of  		discrimination based on advance directives. Facilities cannot "condition the  		provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on  		whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive."<sup><font><a href="#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
<p>To promote the dissemination of more accurate and consistent  		information, the Act mandated states to develop written descriptions of  		relevant state law: </p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he state, acting through a state agency, association, or other  		  private non-profit entity, [shall] develop a written description of the law of  		  the state (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the state)  		  concerning advance directives that would be distributed by providers or  		  organizations under the requirements of [the Act].<sup><font><a href="#note63">63</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the Act required the U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services (HHS) to undertake a public education campaign. This apparently  		includes developing or approving national educational materials, assisting  		states in developing state-specific documents, and mailing information to  		Social Security recipients. However, other than preparing a public information  		document (reprinted at 57 F.R. 8194, 8199, March 6, 1992), HHS has done  		relatively little.</p>
<h2><a name="paradigm" id="paradigm">IV. THE PARADIGM SHIFT IN STATE LAW</a></h2>
<p>One way to understand the evolution of health decisions legislation is  		to examine what is emphasized and regulated in the legislation. The result, as  		elaborated below, is a landscape that has predominantly emphasized standardized  		legal formalities and restrictions, with procedural requirements or limitations  		intended to serve as protections against abuse or error. For shorthand, we will  		refer to this as a legal transactional approach. However, these  		laws have been in a gradual but constant state of flux and moving incrementally  		toward an approach that more strongly acknowledges an ongoing and flexible  		process of communication (i.e., a communications approach).</p>
<h3>The Legal Transactional Approach</h3>
<p>A <i>legal transactional framework</i> focuses on the formal steps of  		creating and implementing the legal tools to direct or delegate health care  		decisions in advance of decisional incapacity. In this light, the creation of  		advance directives are treated much like conventional conveyances of interests  		in property or contracts that establish important rights and obligations. The  		validity of the transaction focuses on required legal formalities and  		standardization of the process. </p>
<p>Legal formalities are intended to impress upon the parties the  		seriousness of a transaction and the potential consequences of the transaction.  		Because this is a legal tool that will often be signed and used without the  		advice of legal counsel, detailed standardized formalities are relied upon to  		ensure the voluntary, knowing, and competent execution of the transaction --  		the same elements central to informed consent. However, the task cannot be  		equated with giving informed consent to a particular treatment, because making  		a judgment about how one wants to be treated in a future hypothetical situation  		is by necessity far more value driven and far less fact driven than making a  		contemporaneous choice about a health care treatment for a condition about  		which the person has been fully informed.<sup><font><a href="#note64">64</a></font></sup> Therefore the focus of the voluntary,  		knowing, and competent act is on the transaction that creates the advance  		directive.<sup><font><a href="#note65">65</a></font></sup> Finally,  		another goal of standardization of forms is the enhancement of their  		recognition and compliance by health care providers. </p>
<p>States have required several kinds of legal formalities for execution of  		advance directives:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><i>Standardized statutory forms</i>. In most states, these are  			 provided as optional models, but they may sometimes be seen as the only safe  			 option to use. Often they are perceived as mandatory if the law requires that  			 the advance directive be substantially in the form contained in the  			 statute. Six states require <i>any</i> advance directive to be  			 substantially in the form contained in the statute;<sup><font><a href="#note66">66</a></font></sup> four more apply the requirement  			 only to health care powers of attorney;<sup><font><a href="#note67">67</a></font></sup> and three more only to living  			 wills.<sup><font><a href="#note68">68</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Required disclosures or warnings</i>. Eight states require  			 specific disclosures or notice to persons executing health care powers of  			 attorney.<sup><font><a href="#note69">69</a></font></sup> In six of  			 these states the requirement is part of the mandatory forms noted above, but  			 two -- Ohio and Wisconsin -- apply the requirement to any preprinted form  			 distributed in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Prescribed phrases for authorizing certain wishes</i>. A number  			 of states require that the directive expressly address certain matters, such as  			 nutrition and hydration, with specificity if it is the individuals intent  			 to authorize their withdrawal. The specificity required in four states rises to  			 the level of mandatory magic words.<sup><font><a href="#note70">70</a></font></sup> For example, Ohio requires that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he declarants declaration shall use either or both of the  				terms terminal condition and permanently unconscious  				state and shall define or otherwise explain those terms in a manner that  				is substantially consistent with the provisions of [code  				section].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the declarants wishes must be communicated by:</p>
<blockquote><p>Including a statement in capital letters or other conspicuous  				type, including, but not limited to, a different font, bigger type, or boldface  				type, that the declarants attending physician may withhold or withdraw  				nutrition and hydration [under conditions specified in the act].<sup><font><a href="#note71">71</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Required witnessing and restrictions on who may be a witness</i>.  			 In most states, two adult witnesses are sufficient for execution of a  			 directive, although witness qualifications -- or rather disqualifications --  			 can be many. Most commonly disqualified as witnesses are the named agent, the  			 treating health care provider and facility staff.<sup><font><a href="#note72">72</a></font></sup> Three states require the directive to be  			 both witnessed and notarized.<sup><font><a href="#note73">73</a></font></sup> Six states impose special witnessing  			 requirements on directives executed in an institutional setting.<sup><font><a href="#note74">74</a></font></sup> South Carolina provides an example of  			 extensive witness disqualifications. Each witness must state in an affidavit  			 that:</p>
<blockquote><p>the witness is not related to the principal by blood, marriage, or  				adoption, either as a spouse, lineal ancestor, descendant of the parents of the  				principal, or spouse of any of them; not directly financially responsible for  				the principal's medical care; not entitled to any portion of the principal's  				estate upon his decease under a will of the principal then existing or as an  				heir by intestate succession; not a beneficiary of a life insurance policy of  				the principal; and not appointed as health care agent or successor health care  				agent in the health care power of attorney; and that no more than one witness  				is an employee of a health facility in which the principal is a patient, no  				witness is the attending physician or an employee of the attending physician,  				or no witness has a claim against the principal's estate upon his  				decease.<sup><font><a href="#note75">75</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Limitations on who may serve as agent or proxy</i>. Most states  			 restrict who may serve as agent or proxy, most typically the treating health  			 care provider or employees of the treating facility, although exceptions for  			 relatives are common. In three states, the agent must accept their appointment  			 in writing.<sup><font><a href="#note76">76</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The legal transactional approach also utilizes an array of mandatory  		procedures or other limitations. A recent review of these limitations on  		surrogate decision making conducted by the ABA Commission on Law and Aging  		identified the following limitations occurring in varying frequency:<sup><font><a href="#note77">77</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>All living will statutes by definition impose medical diagnosis  			 prerequisites before taking action (usually a diagnosis of terminal condition  			 or permanent unconsciousness), but a dozen states also require a diagnostic  			 precondition before an agent may forgo life-sustaining procedures. The  			 complexity of the process of diagnosis and documentation also varies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A majority of states impose limitations on implementing advance  			 directives if the patient is pregnant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twelve states include limitations that prohibit a surrogate from  			 consenting to medical interventions that are especially consequential or  			 controversial, such as sterilization or abortion or psycho-surgery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirty-three states have special limitations on consent by agents,  			 default surrogates, or guardians to forgo artificial nutrition or hydration.  			 These range from an absolute bar on default surrogates to required diagnostic  			 preconditions.<sup><font><a href="#note78">78</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The legal approach to advance care planning may have served to impede  		rather than promote effective advance care planning. An ample body of research,  		summarized by Fagerlin and Schneider and others, reveals that conventional  		advance directives have had relatively little impact on end-of-life decision  		making. Tersely summarized, some of the significant reasons for the lack of  		impact include the following:</p>
<ul><li>too few people make use of the legal tools; </li>
<li>when they do, they do not understand the forms they complete nor the  		  future decisions that might have to be made;</li>
<li>the forms themselves do not provide much guidance;</li>
<li>patents goals and preferences for care may change;</li>
<li>when principals name an agent or proxy, the agent seldom understands  		  the principles wishes;</li>
<li>even if they have done all the above, health care providers usually  		  do not know about the directive; and</li>
<li>even if providers know one exists, it does not affect patient  		  care.<sup><font><a href="#note79">79</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>The Institute of Medicine in its seminal 1997 report on improving care  		at the end-of-life likewise questioned the value of conventional advance  		directives: </p>
<blockquote><p>The committee, while recognizing the value of advance directives,  		  questions the urgency of intensive efforts to universalize their use. In this  		  area of decision making at the end-of-life, the laws favorite product --  		  the legally binding document -- may sometimes stand in the way of, rather than  		  ease, the process, especially if these documents are naively viewed as ultimate  		  solutions to the difficulties of decision making. Rather, the documents known  		  as advance directives should be seen as a set of tools useful in the ongoing  		  process of advance care planning.<sup><font><a href="#note80">80</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the transactional approach leads to unnecessary concerns about  		the portability of advance directives across state lines. Most state advance  		directive statutes explicitly recognize the validity of advance directives  		executed in other states,<sup><font><a href="#note81">81</a></font></sup> although the recognition means only that the  		directive will be considered validly executed. It does not mean that the  		out-of-state directive will be interpreted according to the law of the state  		where it was executed. For both legal and practical reasons, it will likely be  		interpreted according to the law of the state where it is implemented. With the  		variability of limitations on authority, presumptions, and definitions of  		terms, the original wishes of the individual could be thwarted. If state law  		has no express recognition of out-of-state directives, the doctrine of comity  		supports such recognition. But, the lack of specific authority itself may  		engender greater doubt and confusion among medical providers, advisors, and the  		public. </p>
<p>There is virtually no empirical evidence to suggest portability is a  		large problem. However, anecdotally, this author has found it to be a common  		question among older persons who attend programs on health care advance care  		planning. In such a highly mobile society, the concern may affect many  		people.</p>
<h3>The Communications Approach</h3>
<p>In response to the experienced shortcomings of the transactional  		approach, an alternative paradigm has emerged -- a communications approach.  		This paradigm derives from the concept of <i>advance care planning</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]dvance care planning is a broader, less legally focused concept  		  than that of advance directives. It encompasses not only preparation of legal  		  documents but also discussions with family members and physicians about what  		  the future may hold for people with serious illnesses, how patients and  		  families want their beliefs and preferences to guide decisions, and what  		  steps could alleviate concerns related to finances, family matters, spiritual  		  questions, and other issues that trouble seriously ill or dying patients and  		  their families.<sup><font><a href="#note82">82</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Advance care planning involves an iterative process over time to discern  		the individuals priorities, values, and goals of care and to engage a  		proxy and others who will participate in the health care decision making  		process at any time in the future when the individual is no longer  		able.<sup><font><a href="#note83">83</a></font></sup> The call for an  		expanded approach to advance care planning is by no means new,<sup><font><a href="#note84">84</a></font></sup> but only fairly recently have  		its implications for public policy, as reflected in advance directive laws,  		been directly addressed. The well-known tract by Fagerlin and Schneider has  		called for the elimination of living wills and greater emphasis on use of  		durable powers of attorney for health care.<sup><font><a href="#note85">85</a></font></sup> Lo and Steinbrook have called for radical  		simplification of these statutes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Legal requirements that were intended to protect patients may be  		  counterproductive. Requirements that written advance directives be witnessed or  		  notarized place burdens on patients who complete themAdvance directives  		  would be more useful if they emphasized advance care planning, particularly  		  discussions of end-of-life care with physicians, rather than completing a legal  		  document</p>
<p>We suggest that such discussions between physicians and patients are  		  at the core of informed advance planning. Documentation of discussions is  		  important, but should not be so complicated as to discourage the discussions  		  themselvesPatients should be able to designate health care proxies  		  through oral statements to physicians.<sup><font><a href="#note86">86</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While state advance directive law is far from the model advocated by Lo  		and Steinbrook, the growing prominence of a communications approach is  		reflected in incremental but real steps toward simplification of state law,  		especially with respect to mandatory forms or language. As noted earlier, the  		model for simplification has been the 1993 Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act,  		which has prompted a number of states to combine disparate pieces of health  		care decisions provisions into comprehensive acts. Another possible measure of  		simplification is to ask whether state law has become uncomplicated enough to  		enable a single advance directive form to meet the statutory requirements of  		all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The <i>Five Wishes</i> advance  		directive provides one such measure.</p>
<p>In the last ten years, the <i>Five Wishes</i> advance directive, created  		by the organization Aging with Dignity, Inc., has been the only form  		affirmatively marketed nationally.<sup><font><a href="#note87">87</a></font></sup> As a consultant to Aging with Dignity, this  		author compared <i>Five Wishes</i> to the statutory requirements in all 50  		states and the District of Columbia at the time it was released for national  		distribution in 1978 and periodically since then to determine its statutory  		compliance.<sup><font><a href="#note88">88</a></font></sup> In the  		drafting of <i>Five Wishes</i>, Aging with Dignity sought to create a personal,  		easy-to-use, and non-legalistic instrument.<sup><font><a href="#note89">89</a></font></sup> The most prominent barriers to the statutory  		compliance of <i>Five Wishes</i> in all jurisdictions have been the statutory  		provisions for substantial compliance with a statutory form (i.e., mandatory  		forms) along with prescribed phraseology and requirements for including a  		prescribed notice or warning.<sup><font><a href="#note90">90</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In 1978 when <i>Five Wishes</i> was released for national distribution,  		it ostensibly met the statutory requirements in 33 states and the District of  		Columbia.<sup><font><a href="#note91">91</a></font></sup> By 2007,  		the number of state laws friendly to <i>Five Wishes</i> had grown to  		40.<sup><font><a href="#note92">92</a></font></sup> The increase was  		made possible by the trend toward simplification of state law. </p>
<p>Another instructive measure of simplification is a trend toward the  		statutory recognition of oral advance directives documented in the  		patients record. Prior to the 1993 Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act, no  		state recognized oral advance directives. Currently, 14 states recognize some  		form of oral directive.<sup><font><a href="#note93">93</a></font></sup> Most of these states follow the approach of  		the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act which recognizes an oral  		instruction documented in the record as valid and the appointment  		of a an orally designated surrogate where the appointment is  		personally communicated to the supervising health care provider.<sup><font><a href="#note94">94</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A few of these 14 states recognize only oral instructional directives  		but not orally designated surrogates.<sup><font><a href="#note95">95</a></font></sup> A couple states require witnesses as a  		prerequisite to validity.<sup><font><a href="#note96">96</a></font></sup> Permitting oral directives affirms the form  		of communication most likely to occur between physician and patient and  		provides a marker of state flexibility.</p>
<p>Apart from legislative changes, one aspect of advance directive practice  		deserves notice. The tools available to the general public under the legal  		transactional paradigm have primarily been statutory forms and the instructions  		for completing them and related fact sheets. Indeed, these are still widely  		available from health care providers, medical and bar associations, Offices on  		Aging, and on the Internet from groups such as the National Hospice and  		Palliative Care Organization.<sup><font><a href="#note97">97</a></font></sup> Beginning in the late 1990s, self-help tools  		began to appear intended to help the user to understand the process of  		planning, the values and goals to be considered, and how to discuss these  		matters with family, friends, proxy, and health care providers. These are  		essentially workbooks for advance care planning. The written directive is still  		an intended outcome, but greater emphasis is placed on the process, not the  		form.</p>
<p>Robert Pearlman and others at the Veterans Administration Medical Center  		in Seattle produced one of the first of these in 1998, entitled <i>Your Life  		Your Choices -- Planning for Future Medical Decisions: How to Prepare a  		Personalized Living Will</i>.<sup><font><a href="#note98">98</a></font></sup> A small sampling of others that have  		appeared include:</p>

</ul><p>The <i>Lawyers Toolkit</i> is especially significant in its  		targeting of the legal profession which assists a large proportion of  		individuals to complete advance directives.<sup><font><a href="#note103">103</a></font></sup> The <i>Toolkit</i> does not provide  		guidance on drafting, but instead gives lawyers tools they can provide to  		clients to help them understand the planning process, self-reflect, and discuss  		the subject with family, physician, and others. Use of resources such as these  		by no means marks the end of the transactional legal model, but it does suggest  		a growing awareness of the central role of communication at the center of the  		process.</p>
<p>Two other approaches suggestive of a communications approach but without  		much evidence of effectiveness in the literature include the use of notice of  		an advance directive on drivers licenses and advance directive  		registries. Currently, at least six states provide for drivers license  		notice of advance directives.<sup><font><a href="#note104">104</a></font></sup> The purpose of these are to  		institutionalize the dissemination of information about advance directives at  		the time of drivers license application or renewal and to enable drivers  		to include a notice of having a directive on their licenses in much the same  		way that drivers may indicate their intent to be an organ donor on their  		license. No evaluative literature on how these notices function could be  		found.</p>
<p>A drivers license notice fits conceptually well with an advance  		directive registry, so that if an advance directive is indicated on a  		drivers license, there would be a single source to check for more  		information or a copy of the directive. At least eight private entities store  		advance directives, either as a stand-alone service or within a range of other  		services and products: </p>

<p>While both the drivers license and registry strategies seek in  		concept to enhance notice of, and access to, advance directives, there is  		little empirical evidence available with which to assess their effectiveness in  		reaching these goals. It is difficult to predict whether the strategies will  		actually increase awareness and usage, or whether the impact may be to  		reinforce the document approach further rather than the communication approach,  		or whether the public will ignore both. </p>
<p>Private national efforts have been tried for a number of years, but none  		have achieved the critical mass to be truly national. With proxy directives, it  		may be that most individuals will prefer to rely on their appointed proxy to  		step in when needed rather than rely on a registry. And with the expansion of  		electronic medial records, the need for a separate electronic registry may  		diminish. With respect to the latter issue, a 2005 legislative study on the  		need for a state registry by the State Advisory Council on Quality Care at the  		End of Life concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before deciding whether it is worthwhile to create an advance  		  directive registry, especially given the substantial start-up and ongoing  		  costs, the Maryland General Assembly should consider the likelihood that there  		  will be national or statewide use of electronic medical records in the near  		  future. If there is a good chance that electronic medical records will  		  increasingly become part of routine practice, we are skeptical that the  		  creation of a separate advance directive registry is worthwhile.<sup><font><a href="#note108">108</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="POLST" id="POLST">V. A POSSIBLE NEXT STEP --THE POLST PARADIGM</a></h2>
<p>As law and practice move toward a less standardized, more flexible,  		communications approach, questions remains as to whether more flexibility in  		communication will have any greater impact on actual treatment decisions than  		do standardized advance directive forms. An emerging strategy that began in  		Oregon has had a positive impact in bridging this gap between patient goals and  		preferences -- expressed directly, through an advance directive, or by a proxy  		-- and the actual plan of care as reflected by physician orders. </p>
<p>The driver of medical interventions in hospitals and other health care  		settings remains physician orders along with standard clinical procedures. A  		small but growing number of states have recognized that patient wishes, no  		matter how communicated, must be methodically factored into or translated into  		the medical decision making engine. In the early 1990s, Oregon experimented  		with a protocol for seriously chronically ill patients, called <i>Physicians  		Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment</i>, or POLST.<sup><font><a href="#note109">109</a></font></sup> There are several ways to  		describe the POLST process, but relevant to this review are three key tasks it  		aims to accomplish.</p>
<p>One, the use of POLST prompts a discussion between the health care  		provider and patient or surrogate about key end-of-life care treatment options.  		The objective is to discern the wishes of the patient in light of his or her  		current condition and the available care options as explained by the treating  		health care provider. </p>
<p>Two, the patients wishes are incorporated into doctors  		orders that are recorded on a unique, visible (bright pink in Oregon) POLST  		form that serves as a cover sheet to the medical record and is reviewed  		periodically and as needed. The form covers several key decisions that are  		common for seriously chronically ill patients. The Oregon form addresses: CPR;  		the level of medical intervention desired in the event of emergency (comfort  		only/do not hospitalize; limited; or full treatment); use of antibiotics; and  		the use of artificial nutrition and hydration.</p>
<p>Three, providers must ensure that the POLST form travels with the  		patient whenever transfers from one setting to another are made, thus,  		promoting continuity of care decision making.<sup><font><a href="#note110">110</a></font></sup></p>
<p>POLST is not an advance directive in the conventional sense but it is an  		advance care planning tool that reflects the patients here-and-now goals  		for medical decisions that could confront the patient in the immediate  		future.<sup><font><a href="#note111">111</a></font></sup> It builds  		upon ones advance directive but can also function in the absence of an  		advance directive if the patient has decisional capacity. Research on the  		Oregon experience with POLST has shown positive outcomes.<sup><font><a href="#note112">112</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another way to understand the POLST paradigm is to compare it to  		out-of-hospital DNR orders. POLST is a very similar process, except that it is  		not limited to the single decision of resuscitation, and it does not  		presumptively call for withholding medical interventions. It permits a full  		range of plans from comfort care only to full treatment.</p>
<p>Since Oregons development of the POLST form, Washington State and  		West Virginia and parts of several other states have implemented similar  		protocols,<sup><font><a href="#note113">113</a></font></sup> and  		other states are considering following suit. In many ways, the POLST form  		represents a sea change in advance care planning policy by making key provider  		communications reflecting the plan of care highly visible and clinically  		routine and coupling elicitation of treatment preferences with orders for care,  		rather than focusing solely on standardizing patient communications.</p>
<p>The POLST paradigm has the additional advantage of being fairly  		adaptable in the face of variable state law. For example, it has been  		implemented both with legislation (as in West Virginia<sup><font><a href="#note114">114</a></font></sup>) and without legislation through provider  		collaboration (as in Oregon<sup><font><a href="#note115">115</a></font></sup>). To the extent that surrogates are  		authorized to make health decisions under state law, surrogates may complete  		POLST forms. POLST paradigms can be implemented statewide and/or locally  		depending upon legal and clinical receptivity. While POLST is a paper driven  		protocol, it is adaptable to electronic medical record environments. Its  		primary limitation with respect to advance care planning is that, by necessity,  		it focuses on immediate potential decisions and not on distant goal-based  		planning. </p>
<h2><a name="default" id="default">VI. DEFAULT SURROGATES: THE PREVAILING  		REALITY</a></h2>
<p>The fourth wave or tide of legislation described earlier addresses a far  		more common scenario in health care decision making: how are end-of-life  		decisions to be made in the <i>absence</i> of any advance directive, or in the  		absence of an authorized surrogate at all. Guardianship has not been seen as an  		effective solution for these situations in general unless there is a dispute or  		special concern that merits such review. The judiciary has had neither the  		resources nor the expertise for taking on responsibility in all such  		cases.<sup><font><a href="#note116">116</a></font></sup> Default  		surrogate laws have attempted to provide baseline principles and processes for  		default surrogate decision making. But several difficult issues have arisen in  		the structure and implementation of these laws.</p>
<p><i>The Order of Priority of Surrogates</i>. The majority of existing  		family consent laws provide a fixed hierarchy under which family members are  		authorized to act -- usually starting with one's spouse and then next-of-kin,  		proceeding through some degree of kinship. Seventeen states and the District of  		Columbia authorize a close friend as surrogate but usually at or near the end  		of the priority list.<sup><font><a href="#note117">117</a></font></sup> Thus, most of these laws provide a poor  		framework for domestic partners or non-traditional families. Only two --  		Colorado and Hawaii -- avoid imposing any priority. These two states contain a  		list of interested persons (made up of close family and friends)  		and require those available among this group to decide who among them will  		serve as the surrogate.<sup><font><a href="#note118">118</a></font></sup> The trade-off for this greater  		accommodation to non-traditional families is the reality that everyone will  		have to be in agreement among the group, or else the process will not work. On  		the other hand, even in states with a prescriptive order of authority, any  		interested person so inclined can use the judicial system to challenge the  		process. At best, default surrogacy rules can only reflect what most but not  		all people may prefer.</p>
<p><i>Limited Scope of Authority</i>. Only eight states follow the Uniform  		Health-Care Decisions Act model that places no limitations on default  		surrogates.<sup><font><a href="#note119">119</a></font></sup>  		Eighteen states place limitations on the authority of a surrogate to consent to  		the forgoing of a life-sustaining treatment (or alternatively, nutrition and  		hydration).<sup><font><a href="#note120">120</a></font></sup> Of  		these, Arizona and Ohio entirely bar surrogates from authorizing the  		withholding or withdrawal of nutrition and hydration, absent a court order.  		Most of the others place medical preconditions on such decisions, usually  		certification of a terminal condition or permanent unconsciousness. </p>
<p>Other restrictions prevent consent to certain mental health  		treatments,<sup><font><a href="#note121">121</a></font></sup> or to  		exceptional/controversial procedures (such as sterilization or  		abortion),<sup><font><a href="#note122">122</a></font></sup> or to  		decisions to limit any treatment when the patient is pregnant.<sup><font><a href="#note123">123</a></font></sup> A few states limit their  		surrogate consent law to a single type of decision. For example, New  		Yorks default surrogate law addresses only DNR decisions,<sup><font><a href="#note124">124</a></font></sup> while the Kansas and Oklahoma  		laws address only consent to medical research,<sup><font><a href="#note125">125</a></font></sup> and Wisconsins law addresses only  		admission to nursing homes and certain community-based residential  		facilities.<sup><font><a href="#note126">126</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Certain ambiguities about the scope of authority of the surrogate also  		arise in some of these laws by virtue of their legislative context. For  		example, the surrogacy provision is contained in the states living will  		statute in seven states. Because these statutes only focus on decisions made  		after a diagnosis of terminal condition or permanent unconsciousness,<sup><font><a href="#note127">127</a></font></sup> it is not clear that the  		authority of surrogates extends to the full range of other, more routine  		medical decisions that need to be made for patients lacking decisional  		capacity. In three states, the surrogate provisions are contained in general  		informed consent statutes that predate legislative attention to end-of-life  		decision making.<sup><font><a href="#note128">128</a></font></sup>  		These laws refer only to who may consent to needed treatment and do not address  		refusals of consent. A narrow reading of these statutes could unduly restrict  		the authority of a surrogate; however, since the authority to consent is  		illusory without the ability to say no, these laws should be sufficient to  		authorize surrogates to withhold treatments, too.</p>
<p><i>Handling of Disagreements</i>. Where there are multiple surrogates,  		such as in the case where there are multiple adult children authorized as  		decision makers, the issue of how to resolve disputes among the surrogates may  		arise. The most common approach is to permit the majority position to prevail,  		at least among adult children, if there is a majority.<sup><font><a href="#note129">129</a></font></sup> However, a practical question that does  		not appear to have been the subject of research is whether providers will  		actually accept a majority decision in the face of a vocal or angry opposition  		by others. Defensive medicine instincts suggest not. Four states require the  		unanimous consent of all members in the same priority level.<sup><font><a href="#note130">130</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Delaware and Maryland provide for referral to an institutional ethics or  		advisory committee as an option in the face of dispute;<sup><font><a href="#note131">131</a></font></sup> and Maine provides that the health care  		provider may refer the members of the class or classes to a neutral third  		party for assistance in resolving the dispute.<sup><font><a href="#note132">132</a></font></sup> Many simply do not specify what is to  		happen.<sup><font><a href="#note133">133</a></font></sup> Thus, where  		disputes among authorized surrogates cannot be mediated, recourse to the courts  		may be the only option.</p>
<p><i>Lack of Available Surrogate (the unbefriended  		patient)</i>. Patients without a natural surrogate have been labeled  		unbefriended by some researchers.<sup><font><a href="#note134">134</a></font></sup> These are patients who frequently have  		been socially isolated much of their lives, or they have simply outlived their  		family and social support network. The majority of these patients are  		encountered in hospitals or nursing homes, and frequently have multiple chronic  		conditions that may require difficult decisions regarding major medical or  		life-sustaining treatments. It is difficult to estimate accurately how many  		individuals fall into this status, but a 2003 report by the ABA estimated that  		about 3-4 percent of nursing home residents are unbefriended.<sup><font><a href="#note135">135</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Only eight states address non-judicial avenues of decision making for  		unbefriended patients, and one of these (Mississippi) explicitly authorizes  		only consent and expressly proscribes withholding.<sup><font><a href="#note136">136</a></font></sup> North Carolina and Oregon defer to the  		attending physician as decision maker.<sup><font><a href="#note137">137</a></font></sup> Alabama likewise defers to the attending  		physician but requires concurrence of an institutional ethics  		committee.<sup><font><a href="#note138">138</a></font></sup>  		Tennessee and Texas do likewise but, alternatively, permit concurrence from a  		second disinterested physician if an ethics committee is not  		available.<sup><font><a href="#note139">139</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Florida permits the providers ethics committee to select a  		licensed clinical social worker who is a graduate of a court-approved  		guardianship program to serve as default decision maker.<sup><font><a href="#note140">140</a></font></sup> Finally, West Virginia authorizes a state  		agency to serve as default decision maker:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any other person or entity, including, but not limited to, public  		  agencies, public guardians, public officials, public and private corporations  		  and other persons or entities which the department of health and human  		  resources may from <a name="SDU_43" id="SDU_43"></a>time to time designate in rules  		  promulgated pursuant to chapter 29.a of this code.<sup><font><a href="#note141">141</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Investigating non-judicial mechanisms for health care decision making on  		behalf of unbefriended patients, the authors of the ABA report confirmed that  		very few state laws address the needs of unbefriended elderly patients. Of  		those that do, the laws generally fall into four categories: (1) health care  		consent statutes specifying who can consent to treatment, often authorizing  		attending physicians (as described above); (2) creation of volunteer committees  		to make decisions, usually for mentally retarded or mentally ill individuals;  		(3) court processes authorizing limited consent to treatment; and (4) public  		guardianship.<sup><font><a href="#note142">142</a></font></sup> The  		last option was noted as significantly insufficient because public guardianship  		programs are costly and too often overburdened and under-funded. The report  		acknowledges that all of these mechanisms have drawbacks but move in the right  		direction. In addition, the report notes that some hospitals and nursing homes  		are beginning to develop innovative and patient-centered systems to address the  		needs of unbefriended patients. Often, however, when state laws fail to  		authorize clear and ethical mechanisms to deliver or discontinue care for  		unbefriended patients, practitioners and institutions have to fly below  		the radar screen in making decisions.<sup><font><a href="#note143">143</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The report includes consensus recommendations from an expert symposium  		addressing the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>using preventive and pre-crisis approaches such as  		  educating at-risk individuals about advance directives and developing de facto  		  surrogacy relationships through buddy systems;</li>
<li>designing thoughtful mechanisms for decision making that may be  		  internal to a facility (e.g., interdisciplinary ethics committees) or external  		  surrogate decision making committees;</li>
<li>incorporating key patient-centered characteristics into a  		  well-designed system; and</li>
<li>utilizing judicial remedies as a last resort.<sup><font><a href="#note144">144</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><h2><a name="federal" id="federal">VII. THE FEDERAL ROLE</a></h2>
<p>Health care decision making has traditionally been considered a province  		of state law, not federal. Federal law generally defers to state substantive  		law in this area, including the selection and authority of chosen and default  		surrogates. For example, federal nursing home regulations provide:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the case of a resident adjudged incompetent under the laws of a  		  state by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rights of the resident are  		  exercised by the person appointed under state law to act on the residents  		  behalf. </p>
<p>In the case of a resident who has not been adjudged incompetent by the  		  state court, any legal surrogate designated in accordance with state law may  		  exercise the residents rights to the extent provided by state  		  law.<sup><font><a href="#note145">145</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the privacy rule under the Health Insurance Portability and  		Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996<sup><font><a href="#note146">146</a></font></sup> likewise provides that those authorized  		under state law to make health care decisions for another must be treated as  		their legal representatives for the purpose of information access and  		disclosure.<sup><font><a href="#note147">147</a></font></sup></p>
<p>However, Congress has taken action to mandate the availability of  		certain information and education under the 1990 <i>Patient Self-Determination  		Act</i>, described above; and to regulate access to health care information by  		others under HIPAA, as noted.</p>
<p> In addition to the above, Congress made a brief foray into an  		individual state court dispute involving the controversial case of Terri  		Schiavo when it enacted a bill (<i>S.653 -- Bill for the Relief of the Parents  		of Terri Schiavo</i>) on March 21, 2005, to authorize federal review of her  		case. However, the criticism and controversy that Congress generated by its  		action quickly caused it and the Administration to cool their activism after  		Terri Schiavos death ten days later.</p>
<p>Finally and most directly related to advance directives, Congress in  		1996 did enact a federal advance directive, applicable specifically to military  		personnel:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1)  sets forth directions regarding the provision,  				withdrawal, or withholding of life-prolonging procedures, including hydration  				and sustenance, for the declarant whenever the declarant has a terminal  				physical condition or is in a persistent vegetative state; or</p>
<p>(2) authorizes another person to make health care decisions for  				the declarant, under circumstances stated in the declaration, whenever the  				declarant is incapable of making informed health care  				decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of the present nationwide challenges to improving advance care  		planning policy and practice, it is timely to re-examine the appropriate role  		of the Federal Government with respect to improving the tools and processes of  		advance care planning and surrogate decision making. Recommendations for  		possible avenues of federal action are included in a separate document. </p>
<p>Any federal strategy for action should take into account the central  		trend in state policy described in this overview -- the movement of the states  		away from a legal transactional mode of advance planning toward a  		communications model. While, much of the evaluative scholarly literature is  		supportive of that trend, many barriers persist. In some respects, the goal of  		this movement has been essentially to get the law out of the way of good  		planning (i.e., making it simpler, less legalistic in requirements, and more  		adaptable to the mode of communicating and decision making natural to the  		individual). At the same time, concerns about potential abuse cannot be  		blithely discarded. While no significant patterns of abuse have been identified  		in the research literature, the fact that these decisions do indeed involve  		life and death consequences, the protection of vulnerable persons will remain a  		challenge.</p>

<p><a name="note84" id="note84">In</a> 1995, Muriel Gillick argued: Advance  			 planning for future illness should be broadened from medical care in the event  			 of incompetence to all medical care for the elderly. To plan effectively,  			 patients need an assessment of their overall medical condition: whether they  			 are robust, frail, demented, or dying. They need to understand the kinds of  			 complications often engendered by aggressive treatment, given their underlying  			 status. Given information about their circumstances and their capacity to  			 withstand medical interventions, patients, together with their physicians, need  			 to formulate broad goals for medical care. Muriel R.
