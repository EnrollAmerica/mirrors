</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Elderly and younger persons with disabilities who require help from  		others to perform many of the most ordinary activities of daily living are said  		to require "long-term care." These services, when provided in the home or other  		non-institutional settings, may be termed <b>personal assistance services  		(PAS), home and community-based services (HCBS), or in-home supportive services  		(IHSS)</b>. This report presents the findings of a study comparing alternative  		approaches to delivering such services. The purpose of the study was to  		determine whether there are significant differences, on a wide range of outcome  		indicators, when publicly-funded supportive services for the elderly and  		disabled are provided through a <b>consumer-directed (CD)</b> as compared to a  		<b>professional management (PM)</b> model of service financing and  		delivery.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of a <b>consumer-directed model (CDM)</b> of  		service delivery is that it allows persons with disabilities considerable  		choice and control over how supportive services are provided and by whom. In  		particular, a CDM allows public program clients to have an employer/employee  		relationship with their individual service providers, who are referred to by a  		variety of different terms such as <b>home care workers, in-home aides,  		personal assistants, or personal care attendants</b>. A fully developed CDM  		places virtually no restrictions with regard to clients' hiring decisions; that  		is, clients may employ anyone they choose, including family members. A CDM may  		make training opportunities for workers available, but does not limit client  		choice of workers by imposing training and credentialing requirements as  		conditions of employment. A CDM typically involves clients in the process of  		paying workers, at a minimum by having clients sign time-sheets, without having  		clients take on full employer responsibilities. The most common approach is for  		a program operating under a CDM to arrange for a fiscal services contractor to  		process time-sheets and paychecks and ensure that payments to client-directed  		workers do not exceed program authorized limits.</p>
<p>In contrast, a <b>professional management model (PMM)</b> requires that  		the individual workers who deliver services to clients be employed by  		organizations, typically home health or home care agencies, whose  		characteristics and structure are defined and regulated by licensing or other  		laws and by contractual arrangement with one or more public financing programs.  		As employers, the home care agencies and the professionals who run them assume  		responsibility for and authority over hiring and managing the front-line  		service providers. Agency methods of recruiting workers make it unlikely that  		clients will be related to or even previously acquainted with the workers  		assigned to service them, even when the possibility of an aide being assigned  		to work for a family member is not specifically banned (which it often is).  		Public programs reimburse agencies at negotiated rates which include a  		percentage for agency administrative overhead in addition to the direct costs  		of service provision. Agency overhead costs are intended to cover the  		management-related expenses of training, supervising, and scheduling workers as  		well as pay-rolling functions.</p>
<p>Proponents of each of these models of service delivery argue that client  		and worker outcomes are better under their preferred approach. That is, they  		believe that the same resource or benefit levels (e.g., number of service  		hours) allocated to clients with similar levels of disability and therefore  		similar service needs are likely to produce different results when delivered  		through a consumer-directed or professional management model or when clients in  		the CDM hire family members or others as their aides. Proponents of  		consumer-direction argue that the consumer-directed model is more likely to  		produce better outcomes because it offers consumers more choice and control.  		Proponents of the professional management model argue that this model is more  		likely to produce better outcomes because, in their view, professional  		supervision is necessary for quality assurance.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the purpose of the research was to find out whether these  		alternative modes of service delivery were more, less, or equally likely to  		bring about a variety of positive outcomes. These outcomes include greater  		client satisfaction with services, greater client empowerment (i.e., clients'  		sense that program services enable them to live more normal lives despite their  		disabilities), improved health status, greater reliability and continuity of  		service (i.e., lower frequency of worker absenteeism and turnover), greater  		ability to attract qualified workers, and higher job satisfaction for workers.  		The research also examined whether one or another of the service delivery  		models was more likely to produce negative outcomes such as more reported  		incidents of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment, a higher level of concern for  		safety among clients, more unmet needs (client reports that services are  		inadequate to meet their needs for assistance), or poor working conditions for  		home care workers.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing push for consumer-direction  		among client advocates, especially those who represent younger adults with  		disabilities. (DeJong, Batavia, and McKnew, 1992; Simon-Rusinowitz and Hofland,  		1993). This movement has led policymakers at all levels of government to  		consider designing new programs based entirely on the CDM and/or to explore  		ways of incorporating an optional CDM into programs which currently use a PMM  		exclusively. (Nadash, Rosenberg, and Yatsco, 1999). Neither of the two models  		is new; examples of public programs organized along CDM or PMM lines have  		existed for many years (Litvak and Kennedy, 1991; Flanagan and Green, 1994;  		Cameron and Firman, 1995; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995; Flanagan and Green, 1997).  		Various advantages and disadvantages have long been claimed for each model by  		its proponents, but little systematic evidence has been available to judge the  		merits of these arguments (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996; Feinberg and  		Whitlach, 1996; Feinberg and Whitlach, 1998) . To begin to fill this knowledge  		gap, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funded the University of  		California at Los Angeles (UCLA) to compare outcomes of alternative service  		delivery models in the context of California's In-Home Supportive Services  		(IHSS) program. IHSS is one of the few state long-term care programs that  		provide client-directed as well as agency services to substantial numbers of  		clients, both older and younger, with mild, moderate, and severe disabilities  		resulting from a wide range of underlying medical conditions. Using  		California's IHSS as the research locus therefore permits a direct comparison  		of outcomes across the two models while controlling for what would otherwise be  		confounding variations in eligibility, coverage, and payment rules between two  		or more programs within a state or across states. The design of the present  		study also benefitted from previous research on the quality of services  		provided under the IHSS program that sponsored by the state of California  		(Barnes and Sutherland, 1995).</p>
<p>The UCLA study compared the CDM and PMM on a range of client and  		worker-related outcomes, using a sophisticated sample design and multi-variate  		analyses to adjust for variations in clients' severity of disability and other  		differences in client characteristics so as to isolate these effects from those  		attributable to the alternative service delivery models. Although both models  		had positive outcomes overall, the study's principal finding is that clients in  		the CDM had more desirable outcomes than clients in the PMM within three  		broadly defined areas: satisfaction with services, empowerment, and quality of  		life. No significant differences were found in outcomes between the two models  		in two other areas: client safety and unmet needs. Altogether, the CDM had  		significantly better outcomes on six of fourteen specific outcome measures. On  		none of the fourteen measures was the PMM associated with significantly better  		outcomes.</p>
<p>The study also compared outcomes for CDM clients who hired family  		members as paid workers with those of clients who employed non-family members.  		No differences were found with respect to the frequency of reported unmet needs  		or on quality of life measures. However, clients who hired family members had  		more desirable outcomes on some measures in the areas of safety, satisfaction  		with services, and empowerment. Specifically, clients whose aides were family  		members reported a greater sense of security, having more choice about how  		their aides performed various tasks, a stronger preference for directing their  		aides, and a closer rapport with their aides.</p>
<p>With respect to home care workers, the study found significant  		differences between the two models in pay and benefits. Workers in the PMM  		received, on average, higher hourly wages and were also more likely to receive  		health and other benefits from their jobs than workers in the CDM. A  		significantly higher percentage of CDM as compared to PMM workers had jobs in  		addition to their IHSS work. However, workers in both models reported generally  		high levels of job satisfaction and there were no significant differences  		between CDM and PMM workers on these measures. Results were mixed on measures  		of stress and burden. CDM workers reported better relationships with their  		clients and greater acceptance of assertiveness on the part of clients.  		However, PMM workers reported more positive emotional states and also reported  		experiencing less concern about client safety. Some of these differences appear  		to be related to the frequency of family members as workers in the CDM because  		family providers in the CDM were found to be more likely than non-family  		providers to report having close relationships with clients and to be more  		concerned about client safety.</p>
<p>The main conclusion of the report is that, whereas both the  		consumer-directed and professional management models of delivering supportive  		services to the aged and disabled produce positive client outcomes overall, the  		consumer-directed model outperforms the professional management model on  		several key measures of client satisfaction, empowerment, and quality of life.  		Critics of consumer-directed models of service delivery have expressed concerns  		about client safety under this model and have generally taken the view that  		consumer-direction should be restricted to a minority of clients (primarily  		younger adults) who social workers judge to be capable of hiring, firing and  		giving direction to their workers. This study provides no evidence in support  		of restricting availability of the consumer-directed model. Critics have also  		questioned the appropriateness of allowing public program clients to hire  		family members as providers. This study's findings support the option of hiring  		family members as providers because the data indicate that, on average, family  		providers are more likely to provide a higher quality of service than unrelated  		workers.</p>
<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<h3>A. Definition of "Supportive Services"</h3>
<p>Many persons with disabilities require help to perform one or more  		common daily activities. The types of activities for which help is needed may  		include personal care tasks such as bathing, dressing, transferring from bed to  		chair, eating, and going to the toilet (referred to as Activities of Daily  		Living or ADLs) as well as assistance with other routine tasks necessary to  		maintain a home and take care of personal business, such as housekeeping, meal  		preparation, doing laundry, managing money, and making telephone calls  		(referred to as Instrumental Activities of Daily Living or IADLs). Such  		assistance is termed "long-term care," "personal assistance services," or,  		simply "supportive services." Although a majority of Americans who need  		supportive services rely exclusively on informal--i.e., unpaid--care from  		family members, friends, and relatives, a significant minority--primarily those  		with very severe disabilities and/or very limited access to informal  		support--must depend in whole or in part on paid helpers. Through Medicaid and  		other Federal/state programs, persons with disabilities, both those aged 65 and  		above and those who are younger, who meet eligibility criteria with respect to  		severity of disability and allowable income and assets, can receive supportive  		services financed with public monies.</p>
<p>A generation ago, eligibility for publicly funded supportive services  		typically required the client to be in a nursing home or similar institution.  		However, by the mid 1980s, publicly- financed home and community-based  		supportive services had become available in all states, although the size and  		scope of eligibility and coverage under these programs varies widely from state  		to state (Ladd et al., 1995). Under the Federal/state Medicaid program, states  		have considerable administrative discretion over how publicly-funded home and  		community-based long-term care services are provided and regulated.</p>
<h3>B. The Consumer-Directed and Professional Management  		Models of Service Delivery</h3>
<p>This report summarizes the finding of a comparative evaluation of two  		distinct philosophies and organizational models of service delivery: consumer  		direction and professional management. A consumer-directed model (CDM) permits  		clients to hire and fire, schedule, train, and supervise their own personal  		assistance services providers (usually termed "aides," "attendants," or  		"workers"). A full-fledged CDM imposes little or no restrictions on whom a  		client may hire to be his or her helper. In particular, clients in a  		full-fledged CDM are permitted to choose to employ persons already known to  		them: i.e., friends, neighbors, or family members. A CDM typically puts all of  		the responsibility for recruiting and selecting an aide on the individual  		client and any family or friends willing to assist. Occasionally, public  		programs may assist in identifying potential candidates by providing a worker  		registry. Similarly, clients usually bear the responsibility for assuring that  		their aides know how to do the work and for training them if necessary. A CDM  		may make some forms of training available to clients and their workers, with  		public funding to cover training costs but does not require clients to use  		these resources. (Flanagan and Green, 1997). Although the public program limits  		how many hours of service will be reimbursed per client per month, clients are  		responsible for scheduling their workers and clients and workers are free to  		negotiate changes in the schedule. A full-fledged CDM also involves clients in  		the process of paying their workers (for example, by signing timesheets or  		paychecks) even though the actual wages are paid from public funds.</p>
<p>In contrast, a PMM program design requires that aides be employees of  		authorized home health or home care agencies. In this model, the agency hires  		workers according to criteria the agency establishes and the agency also  		determines which of its employees will be assigned to particular clients.  		Client choice among agencies is limited by the number of agencies authorized  		for reimbursement under the program in question which operate in the area where  		the client resides. Not infrequently, there is only one such agency. Within an  		agency, client choice of aides is generally restricted to "veto" power. That  		is, clients who are dissatisfied with a particular worker the agency sends may  		ask to have that worker replaced and the agency will generally honor such a  		request if it has a replacement worker available (although, strictly speaking,  		the agency is not required to do so). By the same token, agencies are free to  		shift employees from one client to another at will, although they may try to  		honor clients' requests to have the same workers on a regular basis. A PMM also  		puts the agency in charge of scheduling aides' hours of work and such  		scheduling is usually arranged to maximize efficiency or other goals. Agencies  		are free to determine whether or to what extent they will accommodate client  		preferences in regard to scheduling of aide services. A PMM also places the  		responsibility for aide training and supervision on the agency. Some public  		programs mandate minimum training and supervision requirements; others leave it  		up to the agencies (or to state licensing laws) to determine how much and what  		kind of training and supervision the agency provides to its aides.</p>
<h3>C. Prevalence of the CD and PM Models in Existing Public  		Programs</h3>
<p>Federal law allows states to determine which of these models of program  		administration (CDM, PMM, or a combination of both models) they wish to adopt,  		even when services are being partially reimbursed with Federal funds under  		Medicaid or other joint Federal/state programs.</p>
<p>A 1988 national survey of state home and community-based supportive  		services programs for the elderly and younger adults with physical disabilities  		carried out by the World Institute on Disability (Litvak and Kennedy, 1991)  		found that within a given program, states typically decide to adopt either a  		CDM or PMM model. Approximately half the states surveyed had one or more  		supportive services programs which permitted clients with disabilities to  		employ their own helpers and, in varying degrees, displayed the distinctive  		attributes of a CDM. The other half of states had supportive services programs  		which followed a PMM and required that aides and attendants for clients of  		public programs be employed by licensed home health or home care agencies  		(Kennedy and Litvak, 1991). Case studies of decision-making, involving  		interviews with state officials in six states, revealed that when program  		administrators elected the PMM, it was generally because they believed that it  		was the "least risky" approach to ensuring quality of care. Program  		administrators in these states tended to view clients as highly vulnerable and  		in need of protection and were also quite concerned with protecting the state  		against legal liability for adverse outcomes resulting from poor quality care.  		Program administrators in the states that chose the CDM were highly influenced  		by the lower unit costs of the CDM versus the PMM. They believed that the CDM  		was the more cost-effective approach and that, ultimately, this enabled the  		program to serve a greater number of clients and provide more generous benefits  		within the amounts that the state legislature was willing to budget for  		personal assistance services. Less frequently, state officials said that the  		CDM had been chosen because this approach strengthened and helped sustain  		clients' informal support systems, which not only saved money in the long run  		but also fostered more reliable, higher quality services. However, a few states  		which implemented a CDM also chose to restrict clients' choice of workers by  		prohibiting the hiring of most family members. Officials in these states  		expressed concern that allowing family members to be paid workers would erode  		families' sense of their responsibility and obligation to provide informal  		help.</p>
<p>A comparative study of state long-term care systems conducted for the  		Administration on Aging (Ladd et al., 1995), identified ten states as having  		made substantially greater progress than others in developing "balanced"  		long-term care systems; that is, systems that invested heavily in the  		development of home and community-based services for the elderly and disabled  		and that controlled the growth of nursing home care. As of 1992, all ten of  		these states finance personal assistance services under Medicaid, either  		through a personal care services optional benefit, 1915c home and  		community-based services waivers, or both. Four of the states (California,  		Washington, Oregon and New York) provided Medicaid-funded supportive services  		through both a CDM and a PMM, with the CDM being the dominant approach in  		California, Washington, and Oregon, and the PMM being the dominant approach in  		New York. The remaining six states (Texas, Delaware, Idaho, Arizona, Arkansas,  		and North Carolina) delivered Medicaid-funded services exclusively through a  		PMM.</p>
<p>In sum, there are examples of highly-regarded Medicaid home and  		community-based services programs organized predominantly around either a CDM  		or a PMM. Over the years, however, various stakeholder groups have developed  		and expressed clear preferences for one or the other model. Generally speaking,  		the disability rights and independent living movements (i.e., advocacy groups  		representing the views and interests of younger adults with physical  		disabilities) have been strong proponents of consumer-direction (Litvak et al.,  		1987; Batavia et al., 1991; Batavia, 1998). In contrast, advocates for the  		elderly, including the organizations which make up the "aging network" have  		long favored formally organized professional supervision and accountability  		under the aegis of government-regulated home care agencies (Ansello and Eustis,  		1992). Very recently, however, some aging advocacy organizations, including the  		National Council on Aging and the American Association for Retired Persons,  		have begun to argue that one or another model may be better suited to some  		clients than others and that the clients themselves and their families should  		have more choice in the matter (NCOA, 1996). Professional home care agencies  		and their trade associations, not surprisingly, assert the superiority of the  		PMM. Trade unions representing or seeking to organize home care aides express  		concern that states may choose to implement the CDM in ways that go counter to  		workers' interests.</p>
<p>President Clinton's 1993 health reform initiative, embodied in the  		Health Security Act (HSA) bill of 1993, included a proposal to greatly expand  		Federal funding for state-run home and community-based supportive services for  		the elderly and disabled which would have required participating states to make  		supportive services available through both a CDM and a PMM. The choice between  		the two models of service delivery would have been largely up to the clients.  		The provision never became law, however, because Congress did not enact  		President Clinton's proposed health reform bill. Nevertheless, the HSA  		provision mandating that both the CDM and PMM options be available drew  		attention to the debate over the pros and cons of these two service delivery  		models.</p>
<h3>D. Debate Over the Advantages and Disadvantages of the  		CDM and the PMM</h3>
<p>Reviewing the arguments of proponents and critics for and against  		consumer direction as compared to professional management and for and against  		employing family members as compared to non-family members as paid workers  		provides a useful context within which to review and interpret the findings of  		the study. These arguments served to generate the hypotheses that the research  		team tested using the data collected from interviews with clients and their  		home care workers.</p>
<p><b><i>Pros and Cons of the PMM</i></b></p>
<p>A home care agency typically is organized and run by some combination of  		nurses, social workers, and manager/entrepreneurs, who hire and train a staff  		of personal attendants and homemaker-chore workers; some workers act as both,  		some only as the latter. The agency may be non-profit or for-profit, and may be  		freestanding or part of a chain. The agency is the employer and supervisor of  		the worker; as such, it sets the work regulations and conditions of  		employment.</p>
<p><b><i>Supporters' Arguments</i></b>. According to its supporters, agency  		direction protects clients from the administrative burden of arranging for and  		supervising staff, and from the dangers of incompetent, unreliable, or abusive  		helpers. This is because agencies screen their workers and check their  		backgrounds, train them before sending them into the field, and guarantee  		service quality through supervision and monitoring by professional staff.  		Agencies are also able to arrange for substitute care if a worker is unable to  		make a scheduled visit. Workers benefit because they have agency coworkers as  		peers for support and consultation, a supervisor on whom to rely, and clear  		agency rules that protect them from excessive or inappropriate client demands.  		Workers also receive fringe benefits such as health insurance, reimbursement of  		work-related travel expenses, and some opportunity for career advancement  		through on-the-job-training and progressive assignment to clients with more  		complex needs.</p>
<p><i><b>Critics' Arguments</b></i>. Opponents of the agency approach  		challenge the whole principle of the professional role as applied to supportive  		home care. Professional authority is grounded in the assumption that  		professionals possess highly specialized knowledge and technical expertise.  		However, supportive services are not medical care. Most supportive services,  		such as assistance with bathing, dressing, housecleaning and the like are  		activities that most people do for themselves or for other family members on a  		regular basis, for which no special expertise is required. Thus, critics of the  		professional management model argue that faith in professional expertise in the  		context of supportive services is misplaced: it serves to limit clients'  		influence over the quality of their own lives.</p>
<p>Critics not only challenge the superiority of agency direction in  		principle. They also challenge its implementation in fact. Agencies, they  		argue, have an entrepreneurial focus that often leads balance sheet concerns to  		override a client focus. Less training and supervision is provided than  		claimed, scheduling so as to maximize billable hours--which often means large  		worker caseloads--may take priority over continuity and quality of care, and  		inflexibility and economy too often prevail above responsiveness to changing  		client needs. Workers are assigned because of scheduling convenience rather  		than compatibility, compromising interpersonal closeness with clients. And  		agency limits on "appropriate" tasks (for example, no driving to nonmedical  		appointments, no climbing ladders) can leave clients without the assistance  		they need when they need it.</p>
<p><b><i>Pros and Cons of the CDM</i></b></p>
<p>Under client direction, there is no agency. The workers are selected,  		employed, and directly supervised by the client, who specifies what should be  		done, and how.</p>
<p><i><b>Supporters' Arguments</b></i>. Supporters of client direction  		focus on the benefits that flow from having the clients the central  		decision-makers. Supporters argue that, in exchange for taking on more work and  		responsibility for directing their own services, consumers gain more power over  		their lives in ways often denied people with disabilities. Persons with  		disabilities (elderly included), advocates assert, are no less enthusiastic  		about or capable of self-direction than others. When necessary, clients can  		turn to others for help and advice in worker selection and supervision. And  		since workers are hired by and responsible to no one but the client, they can  		negotiate with clients about schedules, tasks, and task performance. Because  		this model involves only the client and worker, it enables a given budget to  		cover significantly more hours of services delivered to more seriously disabled  		clients than does the agency alternative, which is more expensive because of  		overhead costs.</p>
<p><i><b>Critics' Arguments</b></i>. To critics, many of these claims fall  		far short of reality. Client direction can be burdensome and problem-ridden for  		many people, particularly elderly people, the argument goes. Recruiting workers  		is difficult and may result in delay in the start of services. Screening and  		reference checks require time and resources and are difficult, even for  		professionals. Lack of professional confirmation of suitability leads to more  		danger of client abuse (physical, psychological, and financial). When the  		worker fails to turn up, clients must find their own backups. And if there is  		client-worker friction, there is no one else immediately responsible for  		improving the situation or finding another worker. Critics also argue that the  		work life of client-directed workers is much more demanding and less satisfying  		than advocates (and budget watchers) admit. Training depends mostly on client  		knowledge and capacity. Workers typically have no peer or support group for  		guidance and advice, there is no supervisor to help with problems, and there  		are no fringe benefits (such as health insurance, pension plans, vacation or  		sick leave) or opportunities for job advancement.</p>
<p><b><i>Pros and Cons of Employing Family Members</i></b></p>
<p>Under Federal Medicaid regulations, relatives may be reimbursed for  		personal care services rendered as long as they are not "legally responsible"  		family members (i.e., spouses or parents of minors). California places no state  		restrictions whatsoever on the hiring of family members as IHSS workers;  		accordingly, California uses state funds to cover the full cost of IHSS for  		clients who choose to hire spouses or when parents wish to be the paid  		providers for their minor children. Some states, however, have chosen to be  		more restrictive than Federal law requires about the use of Medicaid funds to  		reimburse relatives providing services at home.</p>
<p><i><b>Supporters' Arguments</b></i>. Supporters suggest that paying  		family members is a valuable option that reinforces natural caring  		relationships, benefitting both clients and families. For clients, hiring a  		family member avoids the need to bring strangers into the home to assist with  		what may be very intimate tasks. Family members know clients and their  		preferences and, thus, are more likely to perform assistive tasks in preferred  		ways. Family members may also be more reliable than non-family members. And  		those who live with the client are likely to be more flexible and responsible  		to client needs at unscheduled times. Finally, disability can limit the  		economic options of clients and family members committed to providing  		assistance. Supporters contend that public policy should acknowledge the  		economic fragility of these family systems and invest in supporting them.</p>
<p><i><b>Critics' Arguments</b></i>. Critics argue from both fiscal and  		client perspectives. From the fiscal perspective, it is seen as irresponsible  		for the public treasury to pay people for meeting their moral obligations  		within the family system. Paying for services that would otherwise be provided  		without public cost will lure family members out of the woodwork and onto the  		social services rolls, further escalating costs and distorting family  		relationships. It may also attract the lazy and the greedy rather than the  		enterprising and competent, undermining the quality of services to clients in  		need. The client argument is that having a close relative as the only (or  		primary) employee dilutes the ability of clients to maintain autonomy and  		control. The emotional ties and complex family histories can complicate and  		even undermine what should be a business-like service relationship defined and  		directed by the client. Firing a family member (especially one who shares your  		household) in case of unsatisfactory job performance may be extremely  		difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<h3>E. Reasons for Choosing California's IHSS Program as the  		Locus of Comparison</h3>
<p>Although the advantages and disadvantages of consumer-direction as  		compared to professional agency management have stimulated vigorous debate,  		with strong arguments brought to bear on both sides, it is difficult to make  		direct comparisons between the two models because existing programs have chosen  		to implement one or another approach exclusively or predominantly. In exploring  		possibilities for a comparative study of the CDM and the PMM, the Federal  		agency responsible for contracting for this research (ASPE/HHS) quickly  		ascertained that there was no existing state program which presented ideal  		study conditions.</p>
<p>Among the handful of states which offered some possibility for  		comparison of the two models within the same public program, California's  		In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program was chosen as the locus of the study  		primarily because the program serves a large number of clients (approximately  		200,000 at any point in time) and also serves a broad range of clients in terms  		of age, severity of disability, and the nature of the diseases or conditions  		responsible for their functional disabilities. Thus, the study would be assured  		of obtaining sufficient numbers and variety of clients in both models, even  		though the PMM (which, in California, is referred to as the "contract agency"  		mode of service delivery) is only available in twelve counties, whereas the CDM  		(referred to, in California, as the independent provider mode of service  		delivery) is available in all 58 counties. In addition, California's IHSS  		permits clients in the CDM to hire family members as their aides, thereby  		making it possible also to compare outcomes according to whether or not workers  		were related to their clients. About 40 percent of IHSS clients employ family  		members.</p>
<p>Clearly, in the 42 counties where the PMM is not available, all IHSS  		clients receive services via the CDM. However, even in the California counties  		where both the CDM and PMM models are both available, IHSS clients are neither  		assigned randomly to one or another model, nor do they choose which model they  		will receive services through, although their preferences may be taken into  		account.</p>
<p>When individuals apply for IHSS, county-employed case-managers make home  		visits to assess their ADL and IADL limitations, plus cognitive functioning. On  		this basis they determine the number of monthly hours of needed services. A  		maximum of 283 hours a month is allowed for the most seriously impaired  		clients, and reassessments are done annually. Funding per client is capped at a  		maximum monthly dollar amount computed as the maximum hours figure of 283  		multiplied by the state minimum wage--which was recently increased to $5.75 an  		hour--for a monthly dollar cap of $1,627.25 per client. Covered services  		include personal care, household and related chores, paramedical services (such  		as injections, suctioning, and dressing changes), protective supervision, and  		transportation to medical appointments.</p>
<p>Interviews that the UCLA research team conducted with approximately 100  		county case- managers as well as higher level IHSS managers indicate that cost  		considerations exert a strong influence on the choice of models. The unit cost  		of IHSS (i.e., per hour, per client cost) is higher in the PMM than the CDM.  		IHSS contract agencies are typically reimbursed at $13-14 per hour. This is  		considerably less than what Medicare typically pays a home health agency for a  		home health aide visit (i.e., $60 for about three hours). However, IHSS  		contract agencies are statelicensed home care agencies, rather than Federally  		certified home health agencies. State licensed home care agencies are not  		required by Federal law as are Medicare/Medicaid home health agencies to  		provide regular, periodic in-home supervision of aides by registered nurses nor  		are aides required to be Medicare-certified home health aides (i.e., who have  		received at least 80 hours of training with a Federally mandated training  		curriculum). In contrast, hourly costs for the CDM are limited to the hourly  		wages paid to the aide (typically at or only slightly above the state minimum  		wage of $5.75 per hour) plus fringe benefits (including the employer share of  		the Social Security tax on workers' wages) and a small processing fee to a firm  		that provides payroll services under contract to IHSS. Although CDM clients are  		considered to be the employers of their individual workers, the payroll firm  		acts as a "fiscal intermediary," processing paychecks and taking responsibility  		for making Social Security and any other payroll deductions from funds provided  		by the states and counties. The hourly cost differential between services  		provided under the CDM and the PMM is about 40 percent.</p>
<p>Thus, for the most severely disabled clients, who are assessed as  		requiring the maximum allowable monthly hours of service, there is a strong  		motive to provide services via the CDM because the higher hourly cost of the  		PMM coupled with the monthly expenditure cap would result in the client  		receiving fewer total hours of monthly service in the PMM. However,  		casemanagers also take into consideration whether or not a given client is  		likely to have difficulty recruiting a worker in the CDM. As a result, clients  		who case-managers believe may have difficulty recruiting workers are more  		likely to be assigned to the PMM. At the same time, casemanagers are aware that  		contract agencies do not permit their workers to perform para-medical tasks  		(tasks which unlicensed personnel other than family members are not authorized  		to perform under California's Nurse Practice Act) and also do not permit their  		workers to drive their own or clients' cars while escorting the client outside  		the home (e.g., to medical appointments). Thus, if a client needs a paid worker  		to perform paramedical tasks or drive a car, he or she is more likely to be  		assigned to the CDM. The net effect of these decision factors are systematic  		differences in the characteristics of clients participating in the CDM and the  		PMM.</p>
<p><b><i>Generalizability of California IHSS Findings to Other  		States</i></b></p>
<p>In considering the generalizability of the results from a study based on  		data from California's IHSS program to other public programs in other states,  		it is important to bear in mind that there are some variations, mostly minor  		but some more major, in the CD and PM models as they have been implemented  		elsewhere. California's CDM very strongly resembles the approach used by  		Michigan in its Medicaid-funded personal care services program. In particular,  		both programs permit family members to be hired as personal care attendants and  		the percentage of CDM clients who hire family, friends, or neighbors as  		providers in Michigan and California are almost identical. Oregon and  		Washington state's implementation of the CDM are also very similar to that of  		California and Michigan. None of these states requires consumer-directed aides  		to be trained or certified as home care attendants; however, Oregon requires  		criminal background checks for CDM providers.</p>
<p>In contrast, New York's consumer-directed personal assistance program  		(CDPAP) does not permit CDM clients to hire close family members (including  		adult children of elderly clients or parents of disabled adults). Also, as  		exemplified by New York City's Concepts for Independence, CDM providers, though  		hired/fired, trained, scheduled, and supervised by their clients, do have an  		agency as their "employer of record" for payroll and tax purposes. This  		approach is believed to facilitate the offering of fringe benefits such as  		health insurance and worker's compensation to CDM workers and, indeed, most  		workers in New York City receive these benefits whether they work for a  		traditional agency in the PMM or are hired by a client and are nominally  		employed by a consumer-directed agency in the CDM. Some California counties are  		moving toward a similar approach via the creation of "public  		authorities"--which are independent, non-profit organizations with community  		boards of directors (including consumer and labor representatives as well as  		local government representatives). The public authority serves as the official  		"employer of record" for CDM workers, although payroll functions may still be  		performed by a specialized contract firm. A primary purpose of the "public  		authority" variant on the CDM is to provide a mechanism for collective  		bargaining over CDM worker pay and benefits.</p>
<p>In some other states, the CDM is quite different. For example, in  		Massachusetts, Medicaid funding for personal care services goes to independent  		living centers. The centers in turn require the clients themselves (or clients'  		family members) to take responsibility for paying their workers. The centers  		train clients in how to manage their workers but they do not monitor  		client/worker relations. Although some clients treat their workers as  		"employees" and file the employer share of social security on behalf of their  		aides, others treat their workers as self-employed "independent contractors"  		responsible for their own taxes. At the other end of the spectrum of client  		choice and control, Maryland's "independent provider" model incorporates some  		features of a CDM and many features of a PMM. Although clients hire individual  		providers, they are not permitted to hire any relatives (including aunts,  		uncles, cousins). Moreover, training and supervision is provided by registered  		nurses under contract to the state, and, indeed, most clients appear to hire  		workers recommended by the contract nurses. In addition, though clients sign  		time-sheets to verify that providers did the work, the state pays the workers  		per visit as "independent contractors;" that is, they are treated for tax and  		labor law purposes as self-employed rather than as employees of the client, an  		agency, or the state.</p>
<p>Finally, there are also variants across states in the PMM. Some states,  		such as Texas, require Medicaid-funded personal care services to be provided  		through Medicare/Medicaid certified home health agencies. Many other states,  		like California, contract with state-licensed home care agencies, which results  		in a much less "medicalized" approach to professional management. In a similar  		vein, in many states the PMM requires a minimum amount of nurse supervision,  		primarily taking the form of a periodic supervisory home visit by a registered  		nurse (the time period may be as frequently as every three months or as  		infrequently as once a year). Federal Medicaid law and regulations no longer  		require such periodic nurse supervision for personal care services.  		Accordingly, some states have chosen not to apply such a requirement as a state  		mandate. California's IHSS program does not require periodic home visits by a  		nurse and it appears that contract agencies generally prefer to have aide  		supervision done primarily by more experienced home care aides rather than by  		nurses.</p>
<p>Previous research (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996) has found that some of  		these variations in how the CD and PM models are actually implemented in  		practice can significantly affect client outcomes. For example, client survey  		data found that the Michigan approach afforded clients significantly more  		choice and control and resulted in significantly higher levels of consumer  		satisfaction than the Maryland and Texas approaches.</p>
<h3>F. Sample Design, Data Collection, and Analysis  		Techniques</h3>
<p>To draw valid conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of the  		alternative service delivery models with regard to desirable client and worker  		outcomes, the study must be able to identify differences in client and worker  		experiences <i>that are attributable to (caused by) differences between the  		Professional Management Model and the Client-Directed Model</i>. Causal  		differences attributable to the models must be carefully distinguished from  		differences which are the result of various factors operating in the program  		environment, most notably variations in client characteristics. These latter  		include, but are certainly not restricted to, age, social and economic status,  		the nature and severity of the client's disabilities, and whether the client is  		living alone. Such factors could even be more important influences on client  		outcomes than service model--and may in some cases also influence the  		likelihood of a client receiving services via a particular model. Similarly,  		worker characteristics may influence worker outcomes irrespective of service  		model.</p>
<p>The burden of controlling for non-model differences, therefore, lies  		heavily on (1) a sample design that maximizes the precision of the estimates,  		(2) a data collection strategy that yields sufficient information to be able to  		control for a wide variety of factors likely to influence outcomes, and (3)  		statistical estimation techniques that incorporate the multitude of available  		information in a way that minimizes bias, at the same time that it highlights  		the influence of substantively important influences on client and provider  		outcomes. Each of these aspects of the study are reviewed in turn.</p>
<p><b><i>Sample Design</i></b></p>
<p>The client sample was drawn from the California Management and  		Information Payrolling System (CMIPS) database for May 1996. The criteria for  		selection were as follows: being at least 18 years old; not having a "severely  		impaired" rating on memory, judgment, or orientation; and having been in the  		program for at least six months prior to September 1996. Residents of Tulare  		County were excluded because the county was in transition back to a  		Client-Directed Model from a county-wide long-term care demonstration to  		evaluate a model of "managed" home care under which all IHSS clients were  		served by a home care agency that received capitation payments. In addition,  		clients who did not speak--and therefore could not be interviewed in--English,  		Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, or Vietnamese were excluded from the study.  		Applying these criteria reduced the original database from 191,282 to 132,049  		cases.</p>
<p>The research design called for sampling by dividing (stratifying) the  		population into different groups and then selecting a certain number of cases  		at random from each group for the study sample. Stratifying in this way  		increases the precision of the estimates. The target sample for this study was  		first divided into the two service delivery models. Within each, the target  		sample was further divided by age (over and under 65) and severity of  		impairment (severe and not severe). The plan called for a sub-sample of 500  		clients to be randomly selected (within stratum) for each service delivery  		model, yielding a total client target sample of 1,000. The plan for the worker  		target sample, totaling 500, was to select a sub-sample of 250 for each model  		from the pool of workers serving the clients in the study sample.</p>
<p><b><i>Data Collection</i></b></p>
<p>Separate surveys, designed on the basis of well-known, well-validated  		scales from other research, were administered by telephone to the client and  		worker samples. The client instrument asked about client demographics, IHSS  		service use, functional status, disability status, and a great many items that  		together cover five client outcome areas: safety, empowerment, unmet needs,  		satisfaction, and quality of life. The worker instrument asked about worker  		demographics, working conditions, relationship with client, worker safety, and  		a variety of items that together cover two worker outcome areas: stress and  		work satisfaction. These client and worker outcome areas together encompass  		much of the policy debate over service model and type of worker. Follow-up  		in-person interviews were completed with a subset of clients and workers to  		encourage further communication about their experiences in a less structured  		format.</p>
<p>To increase response rates, 12 phone calls were attempted before a final  		disposition was made, strong efforts were devoted to persuading initial  		refusals to become respondents, and it was possible for interviewers to  		postpone completion of a specific interview if necessary to avoid interviewee  		impatience or exhaustion.</p>
<p>The final client sample was comprised of 1,095 clients. The final worker  		sample was comprised of 618 workers. Of all sample members successfully  		contacted, completion rates were high--77.8 percent for clients, 86.9 percent  		for workers. Clients who were contacted and eligible to participate (e.g.,  		still receiving IHSS) but who declined to be interviewed were older, more  		likely to be White, and somewhat more impaired in orientation and judgment, yet  		less likely to be classified by IHSS as severely disabled and having somewhat  		fewer authorized hours of service than those who agreed to participate in the  		study.</p>
<p><b><i>Analysis Techniques</i></b></p>
<p>Since the study collected multiple measures of client and worker  		outcomes, some method was needed to organize the data in a cohesive,  		interpretable manner. Factor analysis was chosen--a well-respected technique  		for ordering a large number of interrelated variables into a smaller number of  		coherent dimensions. The factor analysis yielded the five client outcome areas  		and two worker outcome areas, each with several dimensions within it. (Client  		safety, for example, covers two dimensions: (1) physical and psychological  		safety and (2) sense of security).</p>
<p>To estimate the independent contribution of each explanatory variable to  		a particular outcome, regression analysis was used. This powerful estimation  		technique allows all other variables affecting an outcome to be held constant  		while the effect of a particular variable is estimated. The effect of service  		delivery model on client empowerment, for example, can be isolated from the  		effect of living alone, belonging to a particular ethnic group, living in a  		particular county, and all other variables that prior research or logical  		reasoning suggests may have an effect on client empowerment. In a similar way  		the effect of client age can be isolated from the effect of service delivery  		model and all other potential influences.</p>
<p>For each dimension of each of the outcome variables for both clients and  		workers, a separate equation was specified. The potential predictor variables  		represented in the equation for a particular outcome dimension were selected  		based on insights on the likely predictors of that outcome gleaned from prior  		theoretical and empirical research. In each case, the predictor variables were  		grouped into sets and entered into the specific equations using a hierarchical  		approach. This approach isolates the effects of particular variables of  		interest from the effects of other variables that precede them in their effect  		on the outcome variable, either temporally or logically. It should be noted  		that other approaches to equation specification were also tried in the study,  		without major differences to the resulting estimates. This indicates that the  		study findings are statistically quite robust. In other words, substantial  		confidence can be placed in them.</p>
<p><b><i>Limitations of the Research</i></b></p>
<p>Severely cognitively impaired IHSS clients could not be interviewed by  		telephone and had to be excluded from the main data collection. Since severely  		cognitively impaired IHSS clients may be at greatest potential risk for abuse,  		neglect and mistreatment, it was considered important to find some method of  		including a sample of such clients in the study. Accordingly, a small  		sub-sample of 50 severely cognitively impaired IHSS clients were visited in  		their homes. In almost all cases, the clients proved to be so impaired that  		they could not be personally interviewed. Moreover, only a few such clients had  		family members living in the household who were not also serving as their IHSS  		providers. Under these circumstances, it was clearly impossible to obtain an  		independent evaluation of worker behavior and performance. Without exception  		these severely cognitively impaired clients qualified for Medicaid-funded  		nursing home placement. The researchers who conducted the in-home interviews  		reported that it appeared to be only because of the strong commitment of the  		clients' family members to providing home care, both with and without pay, that  		these clients remained in the community. A description of these in-home  		interviews with workers and, where possible, other family members of severely  		cognitively impaired clients is included in the appendices of the full  		technical report.</p>
<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. FINDINGS</a></h2>
<p>The first section (<a href="#secII.A">Section A</a>) presents  		descriptive findings about clients and providers in the alternative service  		models. There are several purposes for presenting this descriptive information  		before moving on to a discussion of model-related outcomes, as adjusted via  		multi- variate analysis to control for differences in clients' level of service  		need and other client/worker variables that could also predict differential  		outcomes. One purpose is to provide an overall comparison of clients' and  		providers' experiences with the IHSS program, by model and by client/provider  		relationship--without statistical adjustments for differences in client and  		provider characteristics. These unadjusted percentages provide a better  		overview than the more complex multi-variate regression results of how the  		majority of clients and providers in each of the models experience the IHSS  		program. As such, these data provide an interpretive context for subsequent  		discussion about the extent to which desirable outcomes are attributable to  		service models per se or to family/non-family providers as distinct from other  		client and provider variables. The major contextual point that deserves to be  		underscored here is that, overall, IHSS clients and providers reported  		experiences that were considerably more positive than negative and that highly  		negative experiences are rare, regardless of which service model they were in  		and regardless of whether CDM providers were family members or non-family  		members.</p>
<p>A second purpose for providing descriptive results is to point out  		various ways in which clients' actual experiences with alternative service  		delivery approaches typically resemble or differ from the expectations of  		proponents and critics as outlined earlier in the "debate" section. It is quite  		striking that some of the anticipated differences across service models are not  		reflected in client or provider reports and some anticipated differences which  		did appear were considerably weaker than expected. Third, the descriptive data  		reveal many significant differences in client and provider characteristics in  		the CDM and the PMM and within the CDM by client/provider relationship,  		clarifying the need for multi-variate analyses to determine whether differences  		in client and provider outcomes associated with service delivery alternatives  		are actually attributable to these organizational variants or to differences in  		the characteristics of clients who use each of the options.</p>
<h3><a name="secII.A" id="secII.A">A. Descriptive Overview of Client and  		Provider Characteristics in the CD and PM Models and Within the CDM, Where  		Clients Have Hired Family as Compared to Non-Family Providers</a></h3>
<p><b><i>Client Demographics, Service Need, and Reliance on Informal/Formal  		Supports</i></b></p>
<p>In the IHSS program as a whole, over 90 percent of clients receive  		services through the CDM. To a certain extent, differences in CDM and PMM  		client characteristics represent population differences (e.g., prevalence in  		certain areas of various racial/ethnic groups, younger adults with disabilities  		as compared to frail elderly) in counties where only the CDM is available as  		compared to the 12 counties where both models are available. However, in  		counties offering both the CDM and the PMM, clients were more likely to be  		receiving services via the PMM if they had relatively few service needs, lived  		alone, and were assessed as needing help finding a provider.</p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> displays statistically significant  		differences in demographic characteristics of clients by service delivery  		model. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> shows the significant areas of difference  		in client functional status across models. <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> shows  		the differences in availability of and reliance on informal supports and  		reliance on other (non-IHSS) formal services across models.</p>
<p>Overall, PMM clients were more likely to be White and to be better  		educated, while CDM clients were more likely to be ethnically diverse (Black,  		Latino, and Asian) and to have less than a high school education. On average,  		those clients using the CDM also have greater service needs than those in the  		PMM. More CDM clients have both ADL (e.g., eating, bathing, dressing, etc.) and  		IADL (e.g., preparing meals, shopping, housecleaning, etc.) needs, while more  		PMM clients have no ADL needs and comparatively fewer IADL ones.</p>
<p>A majority of PMM clients live alone, while a majority of CDM clients  		share a household with others. PMM clients also report receiving less help from  		family and friends; however, they are better connected to other formal and  		volunteer services (e.g., senior centers, adult day care centers, support  		groups, etc.) than CDM clients, who are more confident about availability of  		help from informal support networks and less dependent on community services  		other than IHSS. The only exception to this rule was that CDM clients with  		non-family providers were more likely to be users of vocational rehabilitation  		services. Thus, client direction is more often implemented in the context of  		strong informal support systems, whereas the PMM is more often implemented in  		the context of dependence on other formal services.</p>
<p>CDM clients are not only significantly more likely to receive unpaid  		help from relatives and friends than PMM clients but they also receive more  		unpaid hours of assistance per week (35.7 as compared to 18.6). CDM clients are  		also significantly more confident than PMM clients of being able to access  		backup assistance from informal helpers and CDM clients are significantly more  		likely to say that they have someone to turn to for advice.</p>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> provides data on client service experience  		with IHSS. Because clients who need more hours of service tend to be channeled  		into the CDM, clients in that model receive, on average, nearly three times as  		many IHSS paid hours of service per week as PMM clients (28.3 as compared to  		10.3). CDM clients are nonetheless significantly more likely than PMM clients  		to feel that their paid service hours are insufficient. A sizable minority of  		CDM clients (22.7 percent) characterize their authorized service level as "much  		too low." This is probably a function of IHSS program limits on paid service  		hours. CDM clients not only report receiving both more unpaid hours of help  		from family and friends but specifically, more extra hours of unpaid help from  		their IHSS providers than PMM clients (6.6 hours per week as compared to 0.4).  		(See <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>.) Even CDM clients whose providers were not  		family members received more unpaid hours of assistance from their workers than  		PMM clients, although CDM clients with family providers received significantly  		more unpaid hours per week (9.3 as compared to 4.2) than CDM clients with  		unrelated providers.</p>
<h3>B. Client Experiences: Differences and Lack of  		Differences Across Models</h3>
<p><b><i>Abuse, Neglect, Mistreatment</i></b></p>
<p>Because of widespread concern about the vulnerability of home care  		clients to various forms of abuse, neglect, or mistreatment by their providers,  		it is of particular importance to know the extent of the risk clients actually  		face and whether their risk of being victimized or poorly cared for by their  		home attendants differs significantly by mode of service provision. Advocates  		of professional agency management have long argued that this approach minimizes  		risk because agency-employed workers are better screened, better trained and  		better supervised. Some critics of allowing family members to become paid  		providers argue that this is a risky option because population-based studies of  		elder abuse have generally found family members to be the most common  		perpetrators (Kapp, 1990).</p>
<p>In this study, IHSS consumers were asked whether they had experienced  		various abusive or neglectful behaviors on the part of their providers within  		the previous 12 months. Reports by consumers of having had such experiences  		were rare regardless of the model of service provision (CDM or PMM) or type of  		client-directed provider (family or non-family). On most indicators there were  		no statistically significant differences with respect to the frequency--or,  		more precisely, the rarity--of such reports. For example, 95 percent of  		consumers in both the CD and PM models of service provision said that their  		providers had "never" threatened them and, within the CDM, 96.6 percent of  		clients with family providers as compared to 93.7 percent of clients with  		non-family providers (a non-statistically significant difference) said the  		same. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in reports  		of providers coming to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol across  		models or by provider type (between 95.7 and 98.3 percent of clients across the  		various modes of service provision reported that this had "never" happened). In  		both the PMM and CDM, 95 percent of consumers reported that their provider had  		"never" threatened them. Similarly, 97 and 98 percent of PMM and CDM consumers  		respectively reported that their providers had "never" pushed, shoved, or  		physically hurt them. There was also a very low incidence of reports of  		unwanted sexual advances by workers (between 1.9 and 3.4 percent of clients  		reported such experiences across models and provider types and none of the  		differences in reported frequency were statistically significant).</p>
<p>When consumers were asked whether they had ever thought that their  		provider was responsible for money or other items disappearing from their  		homes, 89.1 percent of PMM consumers said "never" as compared to 93.5 percent  		of CDM consumers--a statistically significant difference favoring the CDM.  		Within the CDM, 98.3 percent of consumers with family providers had "never"  		thought their providers responsible for thefts as compared to 89.1 percent of  		consumers with non-family providers--also a statistically significant  		difference. With respect to neglect, 71.7 percent of PMM consumers reported  		"never" having been neglected by their providers as compared to 83.6 percent of  		CDM consumers--a statistically significant difference. Within the CDM, 91.1  		percent of consumers with family providers said that their providers had  		"never" neglected them as compared to 75.9 percent of clients with non-family  		providers--a statistically significant difference favoring family providers. At  		the same time, when consumers were asked whether they felt safe with their  		providers or how well they and their providers got along, there were no  		statistically significant differences between PMM and CDM consumers. However,  		on both of these measures, there were statistically significant differences  		favoring family over non-family providers within the CDM.</p>
<p><b><i>Reliability, Continuity, and Responsiveness</i></b></p>
<p>In addition to fears about abuse, neglect, and mistreatment,  		policymakers and program administrators often express concern about reliability  		and continuity among home care workers. Frequent turnover among aides is widely  		regarded as a problem in the home care field generally. Similarly, there is a  		perception that home care workers too often arrive late, leave early, or are  		absent unexpectedly. However, this study found worker turnover in the IHSS  		program to be low in both models. A majority of both CDM and PMM clients  		reported having the same provider for the past twelve months (or since joining  		the program), although significantly fewer CDM clients reported having multiple  		providers within the past year. Clients in both models typically reported  		having the same aide for several years, but the CDM clients and workers had  		been together significantly longer, on average. Similarly, CDM clients were  		significantly less likely to report ever having needed to replace a provider.  		Within the CDM model, clients with family providers were significantly less  		likely to have had a different provider within the past year, to ever have  		replaced a provider, and averaged the longest time periods with their  		providers.</p>
<p>With respect to reliability, fewer than 15 percent of clients in both  		the CDM and the PMM reported that their workers often arrived late or failed to  		show up for scheduled visits. There were no statistically significant  		differences between the CDM and the PMM on these measures of worker  		reliability. However, within the CDM, clients with family providers were  		significantly less likely than those with non-family providers to report that  		their providers were frequently late (perhaps because family providers are  		considerably more likely to live with their clients).</p>
<p>Consumers were also asked specific questions about the manner in which  		workers did their jobs. Somewhere between one-fifth and one-quarter of clients  		across models and provider types (i.e, the PMM, the CDM with family providers,  		and the CDM with non-family providers) agreed that their providers often  		hurried too much in their work but there were no statistically significant  		differences across models with respect to this complaint. Fewer than twenty  		percent of clients across models and provider types felt that their providers  		needed to be more respectful and there were no statistically significant  		differences by model or provider type. However, a sizable minority (about  		one-third) of IHSS clients, regardless of model or provider type, agreed that  		their workers needed to be more attentive in listening to and following  		instructions (there were no statistically significant differences between  		clients in the CDM or the PMM or between CDM clients with family and non-family  		providers with respect to this criticism).</p>
<p><b><i>Obtaining Regular and Backup Workers</i></b></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, in the context of the debate over the advantages  		and disadvantages of the CDM versus the PMM, it is widely believed that  		providing services through agencies gives clients greater security in terms of  		making initial arrangements to begin receiving supportive services, in having  		access to reliable backup help when a regular provider is sick or is otherwise  		absent unexpectedly and in being able to obtain another worker quickly when a  		provider quits or needs to be replaced because his or her work is  		unsatisfactory. Proponents of the PMM consider the comparative ease in  		initiating or changing service arrangements to be a significant advantage of  		the PMM, and even advocates of the CDM are inclined to consider this a weakness  		of their preferred approach.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly--given that case-managers mentioned this as a reason  		for referring clients to the PMM--clients in the PMM were significantly more  		likely than clients in the CDM to report that they needed help finding a  		worker. A majority of CDM clients--and a large majority of CDM clients with  		family providers--reported being able to find their providers without help.  		Those CDM clients who received help finding a provider appear to have received  		help primarily from informal sources. In contrast, almost all PMM clients  		reported receiving help finding a provider from an agency or from the  		county.</p>
<p>Among those clients in both models who reported ever replacing a  		provider, roughly half said that they obtained a new provider in less than a  		week, whereas the other half reported that the process took a week or longer.  		There were no statistical differences between CDM and PMM clients or between  		CDM clients having family and non-family providers in the reported length of  		time required to secure a new provider. This lack of a time difference in  		changing providers is noteworthy because one of the often claimed advantages of  		the PMM--and supposed major disadvantages of the CDM--is that agencies will  		have workers available for immediate assignment whereas CDM clients presumably  		have to engage in a more lengthy recruitment process.</p>
<p>CDM clients were much more likely than PMM clients to report that if  		they needed help on short notice because a provider could not come that they  		would turn to a family member or friend for assistance. PMM clients were most  		likely to depend on the agency to send another provider. However, similar  		percentages of both PMM and CDM clients (15.8 and 18.4 percent respectively)  		said that they had no one who would help in these circumstances. When asked  		whether they worried about knowing whom to turn to for help if a provider was  		sick or in an emergency, there were no statistically significant differences  		between CDM and PMM clients. Similar percentages (a little over or under  		one-quarter) of IHSS clients across models and provider types said that they  		worried a great deal or quite a bit about obtaining backup help on short  		notice. Although almost all clients said that they knew how to reach the home  		care agency (PMM clients) or their county worker (CDM) and most felt that they  		could contact the agency or the county worker without problems, CDM clients  		were significantly less likely to express confidence in being able to reach  		their county workers without problems.</p>
<p><b><i>Day-to-Day Aspects of Choice and Control</i></b></p>
<p>The CDM is designed to allow clients more choice in hiring and firing  		workers and more control over scheduling, training, and supervising workers.  		Client reports indicate that the CDM does indeed give clients significantly  		more choice and control in these areas. Interestingly, not only CDM clients as  		compared to PMM clients reported having greater choice about who their provider  		would be, but CDM clients with family providers also reported having more  		choice in hiring than CDM clients with non-family providers. Agencies often  		have rules restricting what tasks a provider may perform and CDM clients  		reported having more choice in this regard than PMM clients. There was no  		significant difference between CDM clients with family and non-family providers  		on this measure of consumer choice. Similarly, CDM clients reported having  		significantly more choice than PMM clients over scheduling of workers.  		Approximately one-third of PMM clients reported that they had little or no  		choice about what days or what times providers came, as contrasted with fewer  		than 10 percent of CDM clients. Even though CDM clients reported significantly  		greater control over how their providers did their work, a majority of PMM  		clients (71 percent) said that they had a great deal or complete choice over  		how tasks were performed.</p>
<p>Program administrators and other experts on long-term care for the  		elderly often express concern that many clients may be unwilling to complain if  		they experience problems with their aides. However, this study found that a  		large majority of IHSS clients regardless of model said they would be very or  		somewhat likely to complain if they experienced a problem. There were no  		significant differences across models in expressed willingness to complain. At  		the same time, there were small percentages--between 16 and 19 percent of  		clients--in the PMM and the CDM, including those with and without family  		providers, who reported that they would be very unlikely to complain about a  		problem with a provider. Nevertheless, when clients were asked who they would  		complain to if there were a problem, well under ten percent said that they  		would complain to no one. PMM clients were more likely to say that they would  		complain to the agency (46 percent) whereas CDM clients were most likely to say  		that they would complain directly to their worker (47 percent), although they  		were also more likely than PMM clients to say that they would complain to  		family or friends or to county workers as opposed to others. Although those who  		are critical or skeptical of the wisdom of permitting clients to hire family  		members often express concern over whether clients will complain about problems  		with family providers, there were no statistical differences between CDM  		clients with and without family providers in their reported willingness to  		complain to someone or who they said they would complain to in the event of a  		problem with a provider.</p>
<p>Because having greater choice and control over services requires clients  		to take on more responsibility and more "work"--which some clients may or may  		not prefer or be willing to do--it is interesting to examine the level of  		satisfaction PMM and CDM clients reported with the amounts of choice and  		control they had. Most clients in both models (82 percent of PMM clients and 94  		percent of CDM clients) expressed satisfaction with how much choice and control  		they had. It appears that clients in both models who were less satisfied  		typically wanted more rather than less choice and control. For example,  		although a significantly greater percentage of PMM as compared to CDM clients  		said that they wanted someone else to supervise their providers (23 percent and  		6 percent respectively), over two-thirds of PMM clients expressed a preference  		for supervising their providers by themselves, without help from anyone else.  		Even with regard to training providers, 58 percent of PMM clients (as compared  		to 76 percent of CDM clients) said that they would prefer to train their own  		providers without help. Less than 12 percent of PMM clients expressed any  		discomfort or uncertainty about telling their providers what they wanted  		done.</p>
<p><b><i>Provider Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> presents descriptive data on the  		relationship between clients and their providers by model type. Because CDM  		providers are recruited and hired by their clients and IHSS places no  		restrictions on hiring family and friends, it is scarcely surprising that a  		substantial majority of CDM providers were previously acquainted with their  		clients. Close to half of CDM clients hired family members, and an additional  		one-quarter hired friends, and the remaining quarter hired persons previously  		unknown to them. In the PMM, virtually all providers assigned to clients by  		agencies were individuals that the clients had never met before.</p>
<p>IHSS workers in both models are mostly female and non-White, but PMM  		workers are more likely than CDM workers to be Latino and to have less than a  		high school degree (<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>). Ethnic/racial differences  		across clients and workers suggest that the PMM is more likely to involve a  		Latino aide assisting a White client, whereas the CDM has more clients and  		providers who are similar ethnically and racially. Interestingly, a criticism  		that is sometimes leveled at the CDM is that allowing clients to hire their own  		providers may permit them to exercise racial/ethnic preferences and prejudices  		in employment, whereas agencies would be prohibited by law from engaging in  		such discriminatory behavior. Although this may be true, the net effect of  		permitting clients to have free choice in hiring is to promote greater  		racial/ethnic diversity in the program's workforce as a whole because client  		choices mirror the ethnic/racial diversity in the client population.</p>
<p>This "match" between client and worker in the CDM is in many cases a  		byproduct of clients choosing family, friends, and neighbors to be their  		providers. At a minimum, compatibility in a home-based service relationship  		probably requires that clients and workers be able to understand and  		communicate with one another. Significantly more PMM than CDM clients reported  		language difficulties in communicating with their providers. Compatibility  		between clients and workers in the PMM may be further complicated by the fact  		that more PMM clients than CDM clients had had multiple providers within the  		previous year so that there were, on average, more workers with whom PMM  		clients had to establish relationships. </p>
<p>CDM workers, on average, are older and less likely to be married or to  		ever have been married than PMM workers. CDM workers are better educated (i.e.,  		more likely to have high school diplomas and to have gone to college). A  		significantly higher percentage of PMM as compared to CDM workers reported  		having quit a previous job to become IHSS aides. This is because for more CDM  		providers, IHSS simply became a second job. About one-quarter of CDM workers  		(both family and non-family providers) reported holding other jobs in addition  		to their IHSS employment, whereas fewer than 10 percent of PMM workers had  		other jobs (<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>). The picture that emerges is that  		PMM workers seek out employment in the home care field whereas CDM workers are  		more likely to take aide jobs as a time-limited response to a specific person  		and set of circumstances. In this vein, PMM workers reported more years of  		experience in home care and had worked longer as IHSS providers.</p>
<p><b><i>Provider Training</i></b></p>
<p>Client and provider reports about training differences across models and  		provider types warrant special attention. This is because of the very different  		attitudes toward training expressed by proponents of the PMM as compared to  		proponents of the CDM. Among proponents of the PMM, it is generally taken for  		granted that formal training leads to better quality care, that agencies are  		well equipped to provide the necessary training and do provide it whether they  		are legally required to or not. An often-expressed corollary belief is that  		public programs should promote quality care by establishing formal training  		requirements which should apply equally to PMM and CDM providers. In contrast,  		advocates of the CDM typically argue that formal training is unnecessary, that  		clients can train their own aides and, indeed, that clients should train their  		own aides because training should be individualized to suit the special needs  		and preferences of particular clients. Moreover, disability rights activists in  		particular tend to argue that if formal training is provided, it should focus  		primarily on employer/employee relations (i.e., teaching clients how to be good  		employers and teaching clients and workers together how to resolve  		interpersonal conflicts) rather than on teaching aides how to perform  		particular ADL, IADL, or paramedical tasks.</p>
<p>The study data (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>) indicate that neither of  		these standard, albeit contrasting, sets of arguments by proponents of the two  		models quite matches the actual experiences and preferences of clients and  		providers in either the CDM or the PMM. Significantly more PMM than CDM  		providers reported receiving formal training; i.e., from sources other than the  		client (95 percent and 71 percent respectively). For the PMM providers such  		training was provided by their agencies (81 percent) although two-thirds also  		reported receiving training in a trade school or college. In contrast, almost  		all CDM providers who had training reported that they had received it  		episodically from home care nurses, physicians, or other professionals,  		including from hospitals and nursing homes. Non-family CDM providers were as  		likely as CDM family providers to have received this sort of client-specific  		training from health professionals.</p>
<p>There were statistically significant differences in the content of  		training that PMM and CDM providers reported receiving (<a href="#table7">Table  		7</a>). The most common form of training that PMM providers received was in  		personnel issues (81 percent). Two-fifths of CDM providers also reported  		receiving training in personnel issues (most likely from county workers who  		explained how to fill out time-sheets and send these in to the payroll firm to  		receive payment.) Three-fifths of PMM providers said that they had received  		training in performance of household chores as compared to only 20 percent of  		CDM providers. This was the only content area in which non- family CDM  		providers were significantly more likely than family members to report having  		received training (27 percent and 14 percent respectively.)</p>
<p>About three-quarters of PMM providers said that they had received  		training in bathing and transferring as compared to 48 percent of CDM providers  		who received training in transferring and 41 percent who received training in  		bathing. However, CDM providers were significantly more likely than PMM  		providers to report that they were actually providing help with these tasks.  		Over two-fifths of CDM providers as compared to one-fifth of PMM providers  		reported receiving paramedical training. About half of CDM clients report  		providing paramedical assistance (including help with medications or  		injections), whereas less than 10 percent of PMM providers say they provide  		this type of assistance.</p>
<p>There were no statistically significant differences between PMM and CDM  		providers or between family and non-family providers within the CDM in  		providers' own perceptions of the adequacy of their preparation for home care:  		only 9 to 12 percent of providers characterized their preparation as fair to  		poor. From the client's perspective, the great majority of clients saw their  		providers as being experienced and well-trained when they first came to work.  		There were no significant differences in client perceptions across models on  		this measure; however, CDM clients with family providers were significantly  		more likely than those with non-family providers to agree that their providers  		were initially experienced and well-trained. CDM clients, and CDM clients with  		family providers in particular, were significantly more likely to perceive  		their providers as currently competent and well-trained.</p>
<p>CDM providers are significantly more likely to have access to and be  		willing to consult doctors about clients' medical problems. Seventy percent of  		CDM providers (80 percent of family providers and 60 percent of non-family  		providers) as compared to only 16 percent of PMM providers said that they would  		seek advice about a medical problem from a doctor (presumably the client's  		doctor), whereas over half of PMM providers said that they would seek such  		advice from their agency supervisor. One-fourth of CDM providers as compared to  		fewer than 10 percent of PMM providers said that they would talk to the client  		alone about a nonmedical problem. Four-fifths of PMM providers said that they  		would consult their agency supervisor. Among those CDM providers who said that  		they would consult someone other than the client, CDM family providers were  		most likely to consult a doctor, whereas CDM family providers were most likely  		to consult a family member or friend of the client.</p>
<p>The propensity of CDM providers to turn to clients' doctors for advice  		may appear to be at serious odds with the whole ethic of "client direction."  		However, before coming to such a conclusion, we might want to stop and ask  		whether it is very likely that providers would even know how to get in touch  		with their clients' doctors unless the clients themselves were willing to share  		this information with them. In other words, if CDM providers feel free to  		consult their clients' doctors, such behavior may in truth be best understood  		as reflecting the high degree of intimacy and trust that tends to characterize  		the relationship between CDM clients and their providers.</p>
<p><b><i>Provider Wages, Benefits, and Working Conditions Across Models and  		Provider Types</i></b></p>
<p>Worker compensation is very different in the two service delivery  		models. (See <a href="#table8">Table 8</a>.) The average PMM provider reports  		earning $6.22 per hour--about 30 percent more than CDM workers who are paid at  		or barely above the minimum wage (which was $4.75 per hour when the study was  		conducted). Differences in benefits are even more striking. CDM providers  		almost never receive fringe benefits such as travel reimbursement, paid  		vacation, sick pay or health insurance. In contrast, two-thirds of PMM workers  		receive paid vacations and three-fifths receive travel reimbursement. Over a  		third of PMM workers receive paid sick leave and nearly two-fifths receive  		health insurance.</p>
<p>Moreover, although reports of problems with paychecks for IHSS work were  		relatively few, such problems were significantly more likely to be reported by  		CDM as compared to PMM workers. (PMM workers are paid by their agencies; CDM  		providers must mail in time-sheets, signed by their clients, and receive their  		paychecks from a payrolling firm under contract to IHSS). In two areas  		(transportation and scheduling), PMM providers reported significantly more  		problems than CDM providers.</p>
<p>For the average IHSS worker, the program provides slightly less than a  		full-time job (fulltime being defined as 35 or more hours per week). Across  		models and provider types there were no statistical differences in average  		weekly hours of work: providers reported working, on average, between 30 and 34  		hours per week. Roughly half of providers, across both models and types, said  		that they would like to work more hours.</p>
<p>There have long been anecdotal reports of clients supplementing provider  		wages, particularly the wages of CDM providers, because of low pay. This is a  		sensitive issue because IHSS program rules prohibit such supplemental pay.  		Across models and provider types, only 10 to 14 percent of providers reported  		receiving extra pay from clients and these differences were not statistically  		significant. However, when clients were asked whether they have used their own  		money to pay IHSS providers more because of low pay, 27 percent of CDM clients  		as compared to 7 percent of PMM clients said that they had. Within the CDM, 32  		percent of clients with nonfamily providers said that they had supplemented  		provider pay as compared to 22 percent of clients with family providers. These  		client-reported differences in supplemental wage payments were statistically  		significant. If client reports are more accurate than provider reports, the  		real differential in PMM and CDM wages may be somewhat lower than the official  		wage rates would indicate. However such "under the table" wage supplements paid  		from clients' own funds are problematic because IHSS clients are all low income  		and can scarcely afford to make such payments.</p>
<h3>C. Client Outcomes: Service Model Impacts and Other  		Predictors</h3>
<p>This section discusses the results of multiple regression analyses.  		These analyses were carried out to determine the effects of service delivery  		model (including the differential impact of family members as service workers  		within the CDM) with respect to five client outcome areas (on a total of  		fourteen measurement dimensions) and two provider outcome areas (on a total of  		ten measurement dimensions). The discussion also notes which non-model  		explanatory client variables (such as age, degree of severity, number of  		workers in the past year) and worker variables (such as age, education,  		experience, training) were statistically significant predictors on which client  		and worker outcome measures. <a href="#table9">Table 9</a> summarizes the  		outcome measures for which service models (PMM or CDM) or CDM provider types  		(family/non-family) emerged as statistically significant predictors. Readers  		interested in the detailed results of the regression analyses for each  		measurement dimension are referred to the technical appendices.</p>
<p><b><i>Client Safety</i></b></p>
<p>The client safety area has two dimensions--client-perceived physical and  		psychological risk and client sense of security. The "perceived risk" dimension  		summarizes client reports of having experienced abusive, frightening, or  		harmful behaviors by their providers (i.e, yelling, threatening, possible  		stealing, pushing or shoving, neglect, injury, alcohol use, unwanted sexual  		advances). The "sense of security" measure reflects client's feelings of being  		safe or unsafe with their aides and their perceptions of how well they get  		along with their aides. Neither of these safety measures was significantly  		influenced by service model type.</p>
<p>That model type does not predict client safety is an important finding  		because proponents of the PMM argue that clients are safer under this model of  		service delivery. Indeed, the presumed superiority of professional management  		in safeguarding client safety is so taken-for-granted that even some advocates  		of client direction believe that a CDM requires clients to make trade-offs  		between independence and risk and often base their advocacy of the CDM on a  		defense of clients' "right to risk." However, at least in California's IHSS,  		the client-reported incidence of abuse, neglect, and mistreatment is equally  		low in both service delivery models. Within the CDM, however, type of worker is  		a significant predictor of clients' sense of security with clients who have  		family providers experiencing a significantly greater sense of security.</p>
<p>Several non-model factors emerged as significant predictors of client  		reports of having experienced various forms of provider abuse. Clients who  		needed less paramedical help, those who had fewer workers in the past year,  		those who were more confident of backup help from family and friends, and those  		who used fewer formal services (other than IHSS) reported fewer incidents.  		Paradoxically, clients who said that they did not have someone to turn to for  		advice also reported fewer incidents of provider abuse. These findings suggest  		that, as might be expected, clients with the highest level of dependency are  		most at risk for provider abuse, regardless of which service model they are in.  		On the other hand, greater access to and reliance on informal as opposed to  		formal supports appear to protect clients from incidents of provider abuse. The  		one predictor that is counter-intuitive and difficult to interpret is that not  		having anyone to turn to for advice is associated with fewer reported incidents  		of provider abuse. It may be that some clients who are able to remain in the  		community despite lack of informal supports are unusually self-reliant and  		capable of looking after their own safety--but these are only hypotheses that  		would require testing in further research.</p>
<p>With respect to sense of security, clients who felt significantly more  		secure were more likely to be White (rather than Latino or Asian), believe they  		were not receiving enough IHSS service hours, live alone, are more confident of  		having backup help, have known their workers before hiring them, and have no  		language problems with their workers. Several of these relationships suggest  		that ease of communication with the worker and trust in the worker based on a  		prior relationship positively influence clients' sense of safety.</p>
<p>That those who live alone should feel more secure seems more surprising  		because other findings generally point to the importance of informal supports  		in making it less likely that clients will actually experience threats to their  		safety. Perhaps those who live alone are a self-selected group who are  		unusually self-reliant and "fiercely independent." In other words, clients who  		live alone may feel more secure because they are more comfortable taking risks  		and are more confident in their own abilities to take care of themselves.  		Alternatively, those who live alone may perceive themselves to be more  		dependent on their workers, choose their workers more carefully, and, for that  		reason, feel safer with workers whom they trust. More research is necessary to  		understand the dynamics at work here. The issue is of interest because the  		disability rights movement has tended to equate independence and autonomy with  		being able to live alone and not relying on informal supports.</p>
<p><b><i>Client Empowerment</i></b></p>
<p>The client empowerment outcome area has three measurement dimensions  		within it: service choice and satisfaction, preferred role, and client  		assertiveness. "Service choice and satisfaction" measures client satisfaction  		with the amount of choice they had in four service areas (which provider, which  		tasks, how tasks were done, and when they were done) and the amount of choice  		clients had, particularly with respect to which tasks are done and how tasks  		are done. "Preferred role" measures client preferences for training and  		supervising their own workers. "Client assertiveness" reflects clients' desire  		to have a major say and feeling comfortable giving directions.</p>
<p>Service model is a strong predictor on two of these measurement  		dimensions: service choice and satisfaction and preferred role. Clients in the  		CDM as compared to the PMM and, within the CDM clients with family as compared  		to non-family providers, reported significantly more satisfaction with respect  		to amount of choice as well as more actual choice and greater preference for  		taking charge of training and supervision.</p>
<p>Other non-model related variables also emerged as significant  		predictors. Clients under age 65 reported greater sense of service choice and  		satisfaction as did clients who reported having enough service hours, those  		with more informal supports, those with fewer formal home supports, those who  		had no language problems with their workers, and those who received extra  		service hours from their workers. Clients who felt more favorable about  		training and supervising their workers included those who needed less  		paramedical help and those who were currently supervising their workers.</p>
<p>On the third dimension of empowerment, <i>client assertiveness</i>, on  		which there were no significant differences related to service delivery models,  		other variables related to client characteristics were predictive. Clients  		tended to be more assertive if they were White (rather than Latino or Asian),  		needed more help with paramedical tasks, received more unpaid hours of help,  		were more confident of backup help, did not have language problems with their  		workers, and currently supervised their workers.</p>
<p>These findings are interesting because they in some respects support,  		yet in other ways tend to contradict, the view that empowerment comes primarily  		from clients having clear "employer/employee" relationships with their workers.  		On one level, it appears that practice makes perfect: clients who supervise  		their workers feel more assertive and confident about taking charge.  		Alternatively, perhaps the empowerment measures themselves are not entirely  		"outcomes" of client experience but reflect, at least in part, pre-existing  		personality traits, such as self-confidence and assertiveness. In other  		respects, it appears that clients may feel more willing to be assertive and  		more comfortable with taking charge when they have hired someone they already  		knew, when they have the protection of other informal supports, and when they  		get positive feedback from workers in the form of extra unpaid hours of  		assistance.</p>
<p><b><i>Client Unmet Needs</i></b></p>
<p>Service model and type of worker within the CDM proved unrelated to  		client perceptions of unmet need. With respect to unmet ADL needs, non-model  		predictors include demographic variables, severity of disability and type of  		service needs, and use of informal/formal services. Clients who reported fewer  		unmet ADL needs were significantly more likely to be White (rather than Black),  		never married, classified by IHSS as having "severe" disability (needing more  		than 20 hours of aide services per week) while also having comparatively lower  		ADL impairment scores on their assessments, and to need less paramedical help.  		In addition, clients reporting fewer unmet ADL needs were significantly more  		likely to report having enough service hours, to be more confident about access  		to backup help, to report more informal support and lesser reliance on other  		formal in-home and community-based services, and to report no language problems  		with their workers. For unmet IADL needs, the non-model predictors were very  		similar to those for unmet ADL needs. These findings are interesting primarily  		for the hypotheses they raise about how persons with severe disabilities  		eligible for IHSS may react to the program's service cost limits, depending on  		availability of other supports. Clearly, clients with low need are likely to be  		able to get their service needs met through the IHSS program. However, clients  		with very high service needs may not be able to obtain all the ADL and IADL  		help they require through the IHSS program because of restrictions on eligible  		hours. Clients who are able to count on receiving substantial amounts of  		assistance from informal helpers are less affected by limits on how many paid  		hours of assistance they can obtain through the IHSS.</p>
<p><b><i>Client Satisfaction</i></b></p>
<p>Client satisfaction is the most complex of the client outcome areas,  		with five dimensions: client-perceived technical quality of care, worker  		shortcomings, service impact, general satisfaction, and worker interpersonal  		manner. "Technical quality of care" reflects client assessments of their  		providers' competence and adequacy of preparation as well as clients'  		perceptions of the quality of their providers' services, their providers'  		receptiveness to direction, and the role the provider plays in keeping the  		client's home neat and orderly. "Provider shortcomings" reflects client  		perceptions as to whether the provider needs to be more respectful and to  		listen better as well as whether or not the provider hurries too much. "Service  		impact" reflects the extent to which the client perceives the provider as  		making it easier for him or her to do things inside and outside the home. A  		fourth factor, "general satisfaction" captures client satisfaction with the way  		their personal care and housekeeping needs are being met. Finally,  		"interpersonal manner" reflects client perceptions of the closeness of the  		relationship between themselves and their IHSS workers. On two of these  		dimensions--technical quality of care and service impact--CDM clients reported  		significantly higher levels of satisfaction. There were no significant  		differences in model impact on the other three measures. However, on one of  		these measures--interpersonal manner--CDM clients with family providers rated  		their workers more highly than those with non-family providers. There were no  		significant differences in impact on the other measurement dimensions by type  		of worker.</p>
<p>Again, there were several non-model-related predictors of more desirable  		outcomes on each of these dimensions. The variables significantly related to  		greater satisfaction with technical quality of care included marital status  		(those not currently married reported higher satisfaction), being less severely  		impaired, having paralysis, reporting enough service hours, lower worker  		turnover (i.e., those who had fewer workers in the last year), and receiving  		more unpaid hours of service. Clients who reported significantly fewer worker  		shortcomings tended to be White (rather than Latino or Asian), unemployed (as  		compared to employed or retired), have better memory-oriented judgment, have  		had fewer workers during the last year, be more confident of backup, and to  		report receiving more unpaid hours. With respect to the service impact  		dimension, clients who were significantly more satisfied tended to be younger  		(under age 65), White (rather than Latino), users of equipment, and more likely  		to report having someone to turn to for advice. On the general satisfaction  		dimension, clients who were significantly more satisfied tended to be those  		with better memory-oriented judgment, those reporting enough service hours,  		those more confident of backup help, and those reporting no language problems  		with their workers. Clients who were significantly more satisfied with their  		workers' interpersonal manner tended to be those not currently married, those  		with less than a high school education, those who reported not having someone  		else available to help on short notice, and those who were previously  		acquainted with their workers.</p>
<p><b><i>Client Quality of Life</i></b></p>
<p>Client quality of life has two measurement dimensions: emotional and  		social well-being and physical well-being. The emotional and social well-being  		dimension reflects clients' sense of isolation, general life satisfaction,  		satisfaction with social activities, and frequency of feeling downhearted and  		blue. The physical well-being dimension reflects clients' perceptions about the  		state of their general health, their energy level, and whether or not they  		reported pain that frequently interfered with normal activities. CDM clients  		reported significantly higher quality of life on the emotional and social  		well-being dimension than PMM clients. On the dimension of physical well-being,  		CDM clients with family providers reported significantly higher scores than  		clients whose workers were not family members.</p>
<p>With respect to other predictor variables unrelated to service delivery  		model, significantly higher levels of emotional and social well-being were  		reported by clients who were White (as compared with Latinos or Asians),  		currently married or never married (compared with divorced, separated, or  		widowed clients), had less need for paramedical assistance, reported receiving  		enough service hours, were more confident about backup help, who had fewer  		in-home formal support services (from sources other than the IHSS program), and  		who had live-in workers. Clients who reported significantly higher levels of  		physical well-being tended to be older (over age 65) never married, Latino  		(compared with White), and male (the only client-outcome for which gender  		emerged as a significant predictor).</p>
<p><b><i>Statistically Significant Client Findings Summarized</i></b></p>
<p>Clients receiving services under the CDM had more favorable outcomes on  		six diverse dimensions of client outcomes, including two measures each of  		empowerment, satisfaction, and quality of life. There were no outcome measures  		on which PMM clients fared significantly better than CDM clients. Within the  		CDM, clients with family members as providers reported more favorable outcomes  		on four dimensions encompassing aspects of safety, empowerment, and  		satisfaction. There were no measures on which clients with non-family workers  		were found to have significantly better outcomes than those who hired family  		members as workers.</p>
<p>There are also clear messages from the statistically significant  		findings on what we have called non-model-related predictors. Four such  		variables emerged as especially important (that is, statistically significant  		in multiple client-outcome equations): confidence in ability to obtain backup  		help, clients' judgments that they were receiving enough service hours from the  		IHSS program, lower worker turnover (having fewer rather than more workers in  		the past year) and the absence of language difficulties between clients and  		workers.</p>
<p>For people whose ability to function depends on assistance from others,  		being assured of regular assistance is critical. Most PMM clients have  		confidence in agency backup help and most CDM clients have confidence in  		informal backup supports. However, sizable minorities of clients under both  		models worry substantially about whom to turn to for backup help (with no  		statistically significant differences among service delivery models).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, client judgments of adequacy of publicly-financed  		service hours reflect the willingness of public payers to allocate sufficient  		resources to meet client needs. As public programs go, California's IHSS is  		comparatively generous. Nevertheless, the existence of a fixed monthly  		expenditure cap (283 hours times minimum wage) guarantees that clients with  		severe disabilities and, as a result, very high levels of service need (in  		particular those whose needs for assistance and supervision are similar to  		those of nursing home residents) will not be able to access sufficient hours of  		formal assistance through the public program to meet all their service needs.  		This means that, the more disabled the client, the more likely he or she is to  		require a combination of formal services and unpaid assistance in order to  		receive enough help to meet his or her needs. Thus, at high levels of  		disability, clients who lack access to informal supports are greatly  		disadvantaged. Such clients probably cannot remain in the community and may be  		admitted to nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Moreover, because the  		hourly cost of services provided under the PMM is higher than that of services  		provided under the CDM, clients with very high levels of service need and  		little access to unpaid sources of assistance are less likely to be able to  		secure sufficient hours via the IHSS to meet their ADL and IADL assistance  		needs under the PMM as compared to the CDM.</p>
<p>With respect to worker turnover, there are, of course, many factors  		involved--including the general labor market, agency needs, worker choice,  		client preferences, and client-worker incompatibility. Even so, number of  		workers in the past year does reveal something about the stability of the  		relationships between clients and workers. The pervasive presence of number of  		workers as an outcome predictor indicates that stability and continuity are  		important to client well-being, other things being equal. A majority of clients  		in both service models had a single worker in the past year. However,  		significantly more clients under the PMM had two or more workers than under the  		CDM. There are indications in the study that many agencies do not consider the  		continuity of client/worker relationships to be an organizational priority.</p>
<p>Finally, ease of communication between workers and clients is  		particularly important in what can be very intimate helping relationships. By  		far the majority of clients in both models reported no language difficulties  		with workers. Given the ethnic diversity of the IHSS clientele, this good news  		may be surprising. But it is also the case that more clients reported such  		problems under the PMM than under the CDM. This is undoubtedly related to the  		fact that threequarters of CDM clients choose workers who are family members,  		friends, or other persons previously known to them.</p>
<h3>D. Worker Outcomes: Service Model Impacts and Other  		Predictors</h3>
<p>Multi-variate analyses were also carried out to determine whether  		workers in the PMM and CDM and family and non-family providers within the CDM  		had differential outcomes with respect to measures of stress/burden and job  		satisfaction controlling for various client and worker characteristics which  		might independently influence these outcomes.</p>
<p><b><i>Worker Stress and Burden</i></b></p>
<p>The worker stress and burden outcome area covers six different  		dimensions of worker perceptions. These include worries about client safety,  		family issues (that is, workers' perceptions of positive versus negative family  		attitudes toward them; in particular, distrust of the worker by some family  		members), reports of problematic behavior on the part of clients (e.g., clients  		yelling at workers, getting upset, making unreasonable demands, or making  		sexual advances), workers' characterizations of the closeness versus distance  		and extent of mutual compatibility in their relationships with their clients,  		worker's self-reported positive or negative emotional states (i.e., feeling  		calm and serene, having lots of energy, feeling downhearted or blue) and  		feelings about appropriate client roles (i.e., workers' perceptions and  		feelings with regard to client assertiveness). Service delivery model was found  		to be a significant predictor of worker concerns about client safety, worker  		relationship with client, worker emotional state, and client role (<a href="#table10">Table 10</a>). Workers under the PMM reported experiencing less  		stress in the form of worries about client safety and more positive emotional  		states than workers under the CDM. Workers under the CDM reported significantly  		more closeness and compatibility in their relationships with clients and also  		were significantly more likely to report feeling comfortable with client  		assertiveness than PMM workers. Within the CDM, family providers appeared to  		experience more stress than non-family providers insofar as they were  		significantly more likely to report worrying about client safety and to report  		negative emotional states (e.g., feeling downhearted or blue, not feeling calm  		and serene, and not having a lot of energy) than workers who are not family  		members. However, non-family members felt more stress in terms of their  		relationships with their clients than did family providers (that is, non-family  		providers reported feeling less close to and less compatible with their  		clients). (See <a href="#table10">Table 10</a>.)</p>
<p>With respect to non-model predictors of worker stress and burden,  		workers who reported less concern about client safety were more likely to be  		women, White (compared to Latino), to work with clients who do not have  		behavioral problems, and to report having only infrequent need for more  		information about how to do their work. Workers reporting less stress about  		family distrust and criticism were more likely to be those with more than a  		high school degree, lower hourly wages, and those who perceive they have more  		choice about their work. Workers reporting less stress about client behavior  		were more likely to have clients who are less impaired on ADLs, to have clients  		assessed as not having behavior problems, to not be living with their clients,  		to only infrequently need more information about how to do their work, and to  		feel they have more choice about how to do their work. Workers reporting less  		stress about their relationships with their clients are more often White  		(compared to Latino), have a second job, have clients who are less  		ADL-impaired, have clients who are less cognitively impaired, and have clients  		assessed as not having behavioral problems. Workers who report more positive  		emotional states are more likely to be Latino (compared to White), have less  		IADL-impaired clients, have clients without behavioral problems, work fewer  		hours with their clients, have more formal training, have more choice about  		tasks, and have more supervision. Workers who report fewer concerns about the  		client's role are more likely to be White (compared with Asians and Blacks), to  		have more education, to have another job, to not have children under 15, to  		have more clients, and to have more training.</p>
<p><b><i>Worker Satisfaction</i></b></p>
<p>The worker satisfaction outcome area covers four dimensions--role  		attributes, performance self-assessment, career benefits, and independence and  		flexibility on the job. Service model had no significant impact on any of these  		four measures. Being a family provider, however, was associated with being less  		satisfied with career benefits.</p>
<p>With respect to non-model predictors of the four dimensions of worker  		satisfaction, workers who feel more satisfied with their own role who are more  		likely to be White (compared with Latinos and Asians), to have a high school  		education, to have more years as a long-term care worker, to have clients  		without behavioral problems, to not live with their clients, to have fewer  		clients, and to report that they only infrequently need more information about  		how to do their job. Workers are more likely to rate themselves higher on a  		self-assessment of job performance if they have a high school degree or more,  		have more formal training, and report that they only infrequently need more  		information on how to do their job. Workers who feel more satisfied with their  		career benefits and have higher job satisfaction are more likely to be Asian or  		Black (compared to White), to have less than a high school education, to want  		more work hours, to have more formal training, and to have more job  		supervision. Workers more likely to be satisfied with the independence and  		flexibility of their jobs are more often White (compared with Latinos), have  		clients with less impaired cognitive judgment, do not live with their clients,  		and to report actually having more independence and flexibility.</p>
<p><b><i>Statistically Significant Worker Outcomes Summarized</i></b></p>
<p>The interpretation of the impact of service model on worker outcomes is  		not straightforward. PMM workers report less worry about client safety and  		about their own emotional state. But CDM workers report less stress about their  		relationship with their clients and less stress about an assertive client role.  		This pattern suggests that PMM workers may attain a certain detachment from the  		pressures of their work--which is, indeed, encouraged by professional  		values--while CDM workers typically have more intimate relationships with their  		clients, including more acceptance of client-directed values. The evidence  		suggests, in other words, that both groups of workers have adapted to the  		definitions of their roles and priorities as framed by the service models  		within which they work.</p>
<p>With respect to types of worker, non-family providers report less stress  		than family providers about client safety, less stress in their own emotional  		state and more satisfaction with career benefits. It appears that family  		providers experience more stress because, as family members, they care more  		personally about their clients and feel a greater sense of individual  		responsibility for their clients' well-being. At the same time, family  		providers may be less satisfied with career benefits because they became home  		care workers for family reasons rather than because they were attracted to this  		line of work. Only with respect to satisfaction with the client relationship is  		being a family worker related to more positive scores. This is not surprising,  		since this outcome assesses emotional intimacy and familial ties can be  		expected to enhance this.</p>
<p>For non-model predictors, several factors show up in multiple equations.  		Workers who are Latino, Asian, or Black (compared to White) tend to report  		higher stress and less satisfaction. More education is also a prominent  		predictor of less stress and more satisfaction. Client behavioral problems, not  		surprisingly, increase several measures of stress (and reduce  		satisfaction).</p>
<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Within California's In-Home Supportive Services Program, both the  		professional management and client-directed models of service provision are  		working well; that is, both models have clearly demonstrable positive outcomes  		for large majorities of both clients and workers across a range of measures. On  		many outcome measures both models appear to perform equally well. However, on  		several key client outcome measures, the consumer-directed model clearly  		out-performs the professional management model. Under the most rigorous of  		scientific comparisons--that is, with multi-variate statistical techniques  		controlling for variability in client characteristics such as severity of  		disability and differential availability of informal supports, the  		consumer-directed model of service provision yielded superior results on  		several measurement dimensions with respect to client satisfaction with  		services, empowerment, and quality of life.</p>
<p>We believe that these findings regarding client outcomes in the  		California IHSS program may be usefully applied by administrators of home and  		community-based long-term services programs in other states. However, one  		important caveat should be borne in mind by those who might seek to apply the  		findings of the study beyond the California context. This caveat is that IHSS  		program benefits are, by the standards of most other comparable state programs,  		relatively generous. This study found clients' perceptions of whether or not  		the hours of service authorized by the program were sufficient to meet their  		needs to be an independent predictor of differential client outcomes,  		regardless of service model. In California, it appears that the fixed monthly  		cap on IHSS expenditures per client does limit the ability of the program to  		meet the needs of some highly disabled clients who have little or no access to  		supplemental assistance from informal caregivers. At the same time, the formula  		for translating assessed needs into eligible hours and the monthly benefit cap  		are generous enough that most clients consider their benefit levels adequate or  		at least not seriously inadequate to meet their needs. In another state, with  		less generous monthly benefit limits, the percentage of clients with  		significant unmet service needs might well be much greater. This would likely  		result in less positive client outcomes for the program as a whole,  		irrespective of the mode of service provision.</p>
<p>We think it is especially important to point out the various ways in  		which the findings from this study differ from widely shared and well  		entrenched views about the advantages and disadvantages of professional  		management as compared to consumer direction. It is particularly striking, for  		example, that, in this study, the professional management model was not found  		to have better outcomes with respect to client safety. The professional  		management model has long been regarded by both its own advocates and advocates  		of consumer-direction as the "safer" approach. Indeed, advocates of consumer  		direction typically argue for their approach by defending consumers' "right to  		risk." In view of the widespread belief that the professional management model  		is the approach that minimizes client risk--albeit at the expense of  		restricting consumer choice and control--it was unexpected and surprising that  		the study provided so little evidence in support of this conventional wisdom.  		Indeed, in the bivariate analyses, with respect to reported instances of  		neglect and suspected theft by providers, consumers in the consumer-directed  		model reported significantly fewer negative experiences--even though such  		negative experiences were infrequently reported by clients in either model. In  		the more complex, multivariate analysis, no statistically significant  		differences emerged between the two models on either of the two safety  		dimensions that consolidated consumer responses to a multiplicity of safety-  		related questions.</p>
<p>We believe that the results of this study with respect to client safety  		measures should lay to rest the notion that the consumer-directed model of  		service provision is best restricted to a minority of exceptional,  		"high-functioning" elderly and disabled individuals, whom professionals have  		assessed and found to be capable of managing their own services. In California,  		the overwhelming majority of elderly and disabled IHSS clients receive services  		through the consumer-directed model, with few untoward results. Although  		instances of abuse, neglect, and mistreatment were occasionally reported,  		consumers in the consumer-directed model reported such occurrences either less  		frequently or no more frequently than consumers in the professional management  		model.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the CDM does place more demands on consumers, and concerns  		on the part of program administrators that some clients may find those demands  		onerous are not unfounded. The study found that approximately one-quarter of  		CDM clients had experienced difficulties recruiting a provider. Consumers in  		the PMM model do not experience such difficulties because it is the agency's  		responsibility to assign them a provider. It is important to note, however,  		that both the consumer-directed and professional management models expose  		consumers to a level of risk which causes distress to a significant minority by  		virtue of the inability of either model to ensure reliable backup assistance  		when a regular provider, is, for whatever reason, unavailable. In both the PMM  		and CDM, about one-third of clients reported that they worried about being able  		to access backup assistance. Because clients in the consumer-directed model  		rely primarily on informal supports for backup, whereas consumers in the  		professional management model depend primarily on the agency to send  		replacement workers, the professional agency model may be the better choice for  		severely disabled clients who cannot rely on informal helpers and who lack  		confidence in their own abilities to make alternative arrangements for backup  		help. Clearly, however, the finding that one-third of agency clients worry  		about access to backup assistance indicates that professional management fails  		to provide a subjective sense of security to a sizable minority of clients,  		many of whom may be receiving services through the PMM because it is supposed  		to guarantee a dependable source of assistance.</p>
<p>Some California counties which offer only the CDM have attempted to  		respond to concerns about the difficulties that some clients may face in  		recruiting providers or accessing backup assistance by offering various  		supportive services. Supportive services include maintaining worker registries  		or otherwise assisting clients in locating and recruiting providers, helping  		clients screen job applicants, making training available, and assisting clients  		in monitoring provider performance and problem resolution. The research team  		identified 27 of the 58 counties offering the CDM model as also offering one or  		more of these supportive services. However, only three counties were judged to  		offer substantial assistance to CDM consumers in recruiting regular providers  		or securing temporary backup assistance.</p>
<p>Clients living in those CDM counties which offered some supportive  		services were significantly more likely to report receiving assistance from the  		county in locating a provider (33.3 percent as compared to 22.7 percent) and,  		more specifically, with finding their current provider (16.8 percent as  		compared to 9.9 percent). However, clients living in counties which offered  		supportive services did not report that they found a provider any more quickly  		or that locating a provider was significantly easier from them than it was for  		clients living in counties without such services. Methodological difficulties  		made it difficult to compare client outcomes between those counties where  		supportive services were and were not offered and, as a result, there may be  		advantages to clients of having these services available that the study was  		unable to measure. Nevertheless, it is apparent that some CDM clients could  		benefit from more assistance in meeting the challenges of consumer  		direction--especially those involving provider recruitment and ensuring access  		to backup workers.</p>
<p>The difficulties that many CDM clients face in recruiting  		providers--difficulties that are concentrated among clients who hire unrelated  		providers--raise troublesome questions about whether the hiring of family  		members is a true choice or just an "easy way out" for some clients.  		Nevertheless, the study's findings with respect to the employment of family  		providers indicate that clients who hire family members as their providers do  		have, on average, better outcomes that those who hire non-family members. Among  		consumers with client-directed workers, those who hired family members had  		significantly better outcomes on some dimensions of safety, satisfaction with  		services, and empowerment.</p>
<p>For a majority of IHSS consumers, the establishment of a close,  		emotional rapport between themselves and their providers appears to be the main  		guarantor that a provider will give "high quality" service. Although the data  		indicate that such interpersonal bonding can and does frequently take place  		between consumers and non-family providers, it appears to be all but assured  		when the provider is a family member.</p>
<p>Despite the concern of some experts that hiring family members could  		expose aged and disabled persons to greater risk of abuse, we conclude that  		this is not a major risk. Consumer-directed clients with family providers  		reported significantly fewer instances of abuse and neglect than clients with  		non-family providers. In bi-variate analyses, the hiring of family members was  		associated with significantly fewer reports of abusive or negligent behavior as  		well as with a greater subjective sense of security and a more positive  		perception of the rapport between consumer and provider. In multi-variate  		analyses, the hiring of family members was significantly associated with more  		positive outcomes with respect to the measurement dimension that emphasized  		clients' sense of security. For many consumers, it appears that the sense of  		security that comes from hiring a family member as a provider is an enabling  		factor that makes them feel more comfortable taking on the challenges of  		"consumer direction." In other words, if 90 percent or more of IHSS  		consumers--as is currently the case--were expected or required to direct their  		own services but were not permitted to hire family members, it is far from  		certain that all 90 percent would be able to recruit workers on their own. It  		is also unclear whether the superior results that this study found to be  		associated with consumer direction could be sustained if the large percentage  		of clients who currently hire family providers were restricted to hiring non-  		family members. In future analyses of the data, we will explore differences in  		client outcomes between agency-employed non-family providers and  		consumer-directed family providers and differences in the characteristics of  		clients in the CDM who choose to hire family members or non-family members as  		their providers. In the meantime, the implication of this report's findings for  		program administrators outside of California is that they may wish to think  		long and hard before adopting a CDM that restricts consumers' choice of  		providers to non-family members.</p>
<p>The findings with respect to paid family providers are particularly  		noteworthy because--outside of California, Michigan, Oregon, Washington and a  		handful of other states--the use of public program monies to pay family  		caregivers remains controversial (Linsk et al., 1988). Many politicians and  		program administrators in other states strongly oppose the policy option of  		paying family members to provide services because they believe that the  		traditional ethic of "family responsibility" requires family members to provide  		these services free of charge. Opponents of paying family providers believe  		that such a policy can only result in substitution of publicly-funded services  		for informal care that families would otherwise have supplied. California IHSS  		officials interviewed in connection with this study counter that, in assessing  		each individual's level of need for publicly-funded services, county  		case-managers have been trained to identify and to subtract out the services  		(such as housekeeping and meal preparation) that family members living in the  		home who are not themselves disabled should be able and willing to provide  		without being paid. As such, California officials believe that the IHSS program  		probably does a better job of preventing the substitution of formal for  		informal services than some programs in other states where services must be  		provided through agencies or may only be provided by unrelated client-hired  		workers but no effort is made to take availability of unpaid family caregivers  		into account in the assessment of need for paid services and authorization of  		benefits.</p>
<p>The question of how many hours of unpaid help families would have been  		able or willing to provide in the absence of the IHSS program and its policy of  		permitting clients to hire family providers--and whether those unpaid hours of  		assistance would, by themselves, have been sufficient to maintain the client in  		the community--is not one that this study was designed, or could readily have  		been designed, to answer. The most that can be said on the basis of the data  		collected is that family providers were found to be significantly more likely  		than agency-employed or non-family, consumer-directed providers to also provide  		additional hours of unpaid assistance. Moreover, 20 percent of IHSS family  		providers were not previously providing unpaid assistance and roughly half of  		family providers quit previous employment in order to be able to become IHSS  		providers. In our view, these findings suggest that, on balance, the advantages  		of permitting clients to hire family providers, in terms of ensuring access to  		combinations of both paid and unpaid assistance sufficient to meet assistance  		needs, probably outweigh the disadvantages associated with any marginal  		substitution of public funding for informal support which may also be taking  		place.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that family providers have a distinct  		advantage over nonfamily providers in that they are legally permitted to  		perform such paramedical or medically-related tasks as bowel and bladder care  		and administration of medications. Debates about appropriate training and  		certification requirements for home care aides often overlook the preemptive  		role of professional licensing statutes in determining who may and may not  		provide certain types of assistance. These statutes often severely restrict the  		role of non-professionals to provide necessary services, unless those  		individuals are patients' family members.</p>
<p>Clearly, there can be little purpose to requiring that home care aides  		receive training and pass certification test in the performance of  		medically-related "nursing" functions so long as state licensing laws continue  		to make it illegal for personnel other than registered or licensed professional  		nurses to perform such tasks, unless they are family members (USDHHS, 1997).  		This point must be borne in mind in interpreting the findings of the IHSS  		provider survey regarding the frequency with which various types of providers  		under the PMM and the CDM report providing paramedical services to their  		clients and report having received training in the performance of various kinds  		of tasks. Paramedical training is typically not provided to aides by home care  		agencies because in California as in most other states it would be illegal for  		such aides to perform these kinds of tasks. To protect themselves from legal  		liability, agencies tend to be quite strict in prohibiting their aides from  		giving in to client or family requests to perform paramedical tasks. The  		difficulty is that the IHSS data indicate that many clients, especially those  		who are severely disabled and therefore at high risk of nursing home admission,  		require assistance with medications or with paramedical tasks. The provider  		survey data indicate that many physicians and other medical professionals are  		willing to train family providers and even non-family, client-directed  		providers as well, on an ad hoc basis, in how to care for particular patients.  		However, it is understandable that home care agencies are unwilling to risk  		circumventing the law. Therefore, in the absence of modifications to state  		statutes regulating nurse practice, agency-employed aides under the  		professional management model will almost certainly remain greatly restricted  		in their ability to meet the medically-related personal assistance needs of  		many "high need" home care clients.</p>
<p>We have seen that, for most personal assistance services clients, the  		consumer-directed model of service provision has clear advantages. For workers,  		the picture is much more mixed. On subjective measures of job satisfaction,  		there were no statistically significant differences between workers in the  		consumer-directed and professional management models. Here again, the findings  		confounded the conventional wisdom in that worker satisfaction under both  		models was quite high across a range of measures. The conventional wisdom has  		tended to hold that providing personal care to aged and disabled persons is  		"thankless" work and that most workers who take these jobs do so because their  		low level of education and training leaves them with few if any other  		employment options. In contrast, the provider survey data on IHSS workers  		indicates that the vast majority of workers like the work and that, assuming no  		difference in pay and benefits, they would not prefer other employment options.  		Answers to the survey questions indicate that the most rewarding aspect of the  		job for many workers is the gratification that comes from knowing that their  		clients need and, indeed, depend on their assistance. In this respect, being a  		personal assistance provider is from the providers' own point of view quite the  		opposite of a "thankless" task. Indeed, most providers say that their clients  		and their clients' families appreciate their efforts. This is an important  		point because it implies that for workers with relatively few attractive job  		opportunities, being a home care worker offers more intrinsic rewards than many  		other jobs with comparable pay and benefits (e.g., other service sector jobs  		such as restaurant, hotel, or office cleaning work).</p>
<p>By objective measures, however, worker compensation for IHSS workers is  		very different under the professional management and consumer-directed models  		of service provision. The average IHSS worker employed by an agency earns about  		30 percent more per hour than a client-directed worker. The latter very seldom  		earn more than minimum wage. Differences in benefits are even more striking,  		with many agency workers receiving travel reimbursement, paid vacation, and  		health insurance and virtually no client-directed workers doing so. The worker  		survey data offers little indication that client-directed IHSS workers are  		generally aware of or resent that they are paid less and have less access to  		benefits than their counterparts who work for contract agencies. This may be  		because within the California IHSS system as a whole, the great majority of  		workers are client-directed workers. In other states, however, where the  		professional management model currently dominates, home care workers might well  		resent efforts by program administrators to introduce a consumer-directed  		alternative unless wages and benefits available to client-hired workers are  		commensurate with those of existing agency-employed workers.</p>
<p>Based on the provider survey data, the pay/benefit differential between  		client-directed and agency-employed workers in the IHSS cannot readily be  		explained by differences in worker qualifications. On average, client-directed  		workers do have slightly fewer years of home care work experience, but they are  		also better educated (that is, significantly more likely to have high school  		degrees and some college). Moreover, there are no statistically significant  		differences in PMM as compared to CDM consumers' perceptions of how well  		prepared their workers are--or were initially--to do their jobs. Moreover, CDM  		providers tend to service more severely disabled clients and, as we have seen,  		to perform more difficult tasks (i.e., more personal care and paramedical tasks  		in addition to housekeeping). For these reasons and because they have no  		organizational support, CDM workers shoulder more personal responsibility for  		ensuring the well-being of their clients.</p>
<p>The lack of a clear justification for the pay and benefit differential  		favoring PMM over CDM workers cannot help but raise questions about fairness,  		particularly when the data show that a significantly higher percentage of CDM  		as compared to PMM workers (about one-fourth of all CDM workers) hold second  		jobs even though most work only slightly under "full-time" in their IHSS jobs.  		It is also cause for concern that about one-quarter of CDM clients report  		supplementing worker wages with their own funds because the pay is too low.  		Clients on public assistance cannot afford to supplement their workers wages;  		moreover, such wage supplementation is against Medicaid rules.</p>
<p>In recent years, both labor unions and organized client advocacy groups  		have criticized the IHSS program for keeping CDM worker compensation at or  		barely above the minimum wage with nonexistent benefits. Indeed, this issue has  		spurred union organizing among CDM workers in California. Several years ago,  		the California legislature authorized the counties to set up organizational  		structures termed "public authorities" that were specifically designed to  		permit collective bargaining by unions on behalf of CDM workers (Kumar, 1998).  		A number of counties, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, have established  		public authorities. However, it has yet to be seen whether the creation of such  		public authorities will lead, as their proponents hope, to meaningful  		improvements in pay and benefits for CDM workers.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to point out that the lower pay and benefits  		accorded to CDM as compared to PMM workers do not fully explain the greater  		cost efficiency of the CDM. In other words, even if CDM workers received wages  		and benefits on par with those PMM workers enjoy, unit costs in the CDM would  		remain lower because of the PMM's higher administrative overhead.</p>
<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. REMAINING QUESTIONS</a></h2>
<p>As always, a major study such as the IHSS study, at the same time that  		it produces new insights, also highlights important questions that remain to be  		answered. We have identified the following priority areas for further  		research:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><i><b>Independent and mediating roles of race and ethnicity</b></i>.  			 Racial and ethnic variables emerged as significant predictors of differential  			 client outcomes, independent of differences in outcomes attributable to service  			 model type or family/non-family providers. These findings have proved difficult  			 to explain or interpret. One hypothesis is that recent immigrant status rather  			 than racial and ethnic background per se is the underlying causal factor behind  			 apparent racial and ethnic differences. Additional research is needed to test  			 this hypothesis. Moreover, additional research is needed to look comparatively  			 at the forces operating on families of different races and ethnic backgrounds  			 when they confront different service models or when public payment to family  			 members is introduced into informal arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>How to go about designing and implementing more effective  			 support services to assist clients in meeting the challenges posed by client  			 direction</b></i>. The IHSS study found that, from the clients' perspective,  			 the only really serious drawbacks associated with the client-directed model of  			 service provision are the problems that a significant minority of clients face  			 in locating and recruiting regular providers and in accessing backup assistance  			 when regular providers are not available. Research and demonstration models are  			 needed to develop and test new approaches to addressing these issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>The role of personal assistance services, including  			 alternative models of service provision and types of service providers, with  			 respect to health maintenance and preventive health</b></i>. Persons with  			 disabilities are heavy users of medical care. Within the study sample, for  			 example, nearly 40 percent were hospitalized in the past year. Supportive  			 service providers are intimately involved in maintaining the health and  			 functional capacity of these clients, but we know relatively little about their  			 effectiveness in prevention and early intervention. Systematic evaluation of  			 the impact of training modules in these areas would enhance our understanding  			 of supportive home care and strengthen the links between acute and long-term  			 care services. However, consideration of a broader role for home care aides  			 with respect to the interface between acute medical and long-term care cannot  			 be addressed without confronting the restrictions that medical and nurse  			 practice statutes place on the kinds of medically-related tasks that  			 non-professionals who are not related to their clients may legally be trained  			 and authorized to perform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Models of client direction for disabled children and their  			 parents</b></i>. More than 7,000 children are currently receiving in-home  			 supportive services under IHSS. Virtually all of them receive services under  			 the "client-directed" mode, although it is self-evident that in the case of  			 children, it is the parent or parents who actually take on the "client's"  			 responsibilities. A majority of the children who receive IHSS services also  			 have one or both of their parents as paid providers. Indeed, preliminary  			 research on these parents suggests that they are in the unusual situation of  			 juggling simultaneous roles as client surrogates, paid providers, informal  			 caregivers, "case-managers" and client advocates. A more systematic study is  			 needed to increase our understanding of how parents of disabled children  			 interact with formal service systems (medical, educational, psycho-social) and  			 about the supportive services they might benefit from to do so more  			 effectively. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has provided UCLA with support  			 to analyze IHSS administrative data on children receiving IHSS  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Worker benefits</b></i>. It appears ironic that so many  			 workers who provide health-related services should lack access to health  			 insurance coverage themselves, especially under a publicly-funded program.  			 Health insurance is generally more affordable when it is provided as a group  			 benefit. Research and demonstration efforts are needed to explore ways of  			 making affordable group health insurance plans available to client-directed  			 personal assistance workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Variations on the Consumer-Directed Model</b></i>. Further  			 research and experimentation with variants of consumer-direction will be highly  			 useful to federal and state policymakers. Currently, the U.S. Department of  			 Health and Human Services, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson  			 Foundation, is sponsoring a "Cash and Counseling Demonstration and Evaluation."  			 (Doty, 1998). This four state project was designed to experiment with a model  			 of consumer direction that maximizes consumer choice and control by providing  			 participants with a cash benefit which allows recipients to make more of their  			 own decisions about and arrangements for personal attendant and related  			 personal assistance services. The cash benefit may be used to purchase a wide  			 variety of disability-related goods and services, including, but not limited  			 to. the services of a in-home worker to provide personal assistance with ADL  			 and IADL tasks. Classical experimental design methodology (i.e., random  			 assignment of volunteer participants to treatment and control groups) will be  			 employed to identify and evaluate the effects of the experimental intervention  			 in a scientifically rigorous manner.</p>
<p>During the design phase of the Cash and Counseling  			 Demonstration/Evaluation, preference surveys and focus groups were carried out  			 in the four participating states (Arkansas, New York, Florida, and New Jersey)  			 to gauge the level of client interest in the experimental intervention. These  			 studies found high levels of interest in consumer direction among both elderly  			 and disabled users of existing Medicaid-funded personal care and other home and  			 community-based long-term care services and among family members who served as  			 "surrogate decision-makers" for elderly and disabled Medicaid service users  			 with Alzheimer's Disease and other significant impairments in mental  			 functioning. (Simon-Rusinowitz et al, 1997; 1998). Although the design of the  			 Cash and Counseling Demonstration/Evaluation permits treatment group  			 participants to manage their cash benefits themselves, the preference surveys  			 indicate that most clients interested in consumer direction prefer to receive  			 only limited amounts of the benefit in the form of cash that they then use to  			 make their own purchases or to pay their own workers directly. Most clients  			 surveyed indicated that whereas they prefer to hire and manage their own  			 in-home workers; they also prefer to have a fiscal intermediary organization  			 pay workers for them. Under this system (which is similar to the process in  			 place for paying consumer-directed workers in California's IHSS program), the  			 fiscal intermediary receives the cash benefit from the state on the consumer's  			 behalf) processes payroll checks and makes applicable tax payments on behalf  			 the client/employers for their individual workers. As of March 1999, the  			 demonstration had been underway for four months in Arkansas but had not yet  			 been implemented in the other participating states: Florida, New Jersey, and  			 New York.</p>
<p>In addition, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded a grants  			 program entitled "Independent Choices: Enhancing Consumer Direction for People  			 with Disabilities." The grants program operates under the auspices of a Robert  			 Wood Johnson Foundation National Program Office established at the National  			 Council on Aging. To date, 13 projects have been funded. Four of the projects  			 (in Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, and Minnesota) involve experimentation with models  			 of consumer direction in Medicaid or other state-funded home and  			 community-based long-term care services programs. (Nadash, 1998.)</p>
