</dl><h2><a name="sectionI" id="sectionI">I. PURPOSE AND POLICY CONTEXT</a></h2>
<h3>A. Background</h3>
<p>Long-term services<a href="#note1"><font>1</font></a> needed  		by chronically disabled people to carry out activities of daily life have  		traditionally been viewed as targeted to the elderly. There is increasing  		recognition, however, that such services may also be needed by younger persons  		with disabilities, including not only individuals with physical disabilities  		but also persons with cognitive or mental impairments due to mental retardation  		and other developmental disabilities, traumatic brain injury, or severe mental  		illness. Designing a program to provide long-term assistance, specifically in  		the home or the community, becomes increasingly difficult when including such  		different populations.</p>
<p>The proposed new benefit for Home and Community Based Services (HCBS)  		included in President Clinton's Health Care Reform Plan and put before the  		Congress in the 1993 Health Security Act (HSA) constitutes the most recent and  		thoroughgoing attempt to develop a legislative and programmatic framework for a  		generic system for providing long-term services. The term "generic system"  		refers to a programmatic approach designed to serve all persons, regardless of  		age, diagnosis, or condition, whose ability to function in daily life without  		substantial assistance from others is severely limited. The goal of the HCBS  		benefit was to expand community-based long-term care services to disabled  		persons without regard to income. Although the HSA was not enacted by the  		Congress, it provides a likely starting point for feature debate around  		long-term care financing and service delivery reform.</p>
<p>The HCBS provisions adopted a "mixed" approach to the issue of  		eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria encompassed individuals who:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>required hands-on or stand-by personal assistance, supervision, or  			 cues to perform three or more of five activities of daily living (ADLs) which  			 included eating, dressing, bathing, toileting, and transferring in and out of  			 bed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>presented evidence of severe cognitive or mental impairment  			 <i>(shown by one or more ADL dependencies, one or more IADL</i><a href="#note2"><font>2</font></a> <i>dependencies related to the  			 cognitive or mental impairment, or displayed symptoms of one or more serious  			 behavioral problems which created a need for supervision to prevent harm to  			 sector others)</i>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had severe or profound mental retardation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(for children under age six) were dependent on technology to remain  			 in the community and outside of a hospital or institution.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>This report examines the issues involved in seeking to address the  		long-term service needs of persons with severe mental illness (SMI) in a  		generic long-term care financing and service delivery system, as was proposed  		in the HCBS provisions of the HSA. SMI, as defined by the Center for Mental  		Health Services (CMHS), is any psychiatric disorder present during the past  		year that seriously interfered with one or more aspects of a person's daily  		life. A key issue addressed in this report is whether a common set of  		eligibility criteria and benefits can apply across populations regardless of  		age and the underlying diagnoses or conditions responsible for the disability  		or whether some specialized eligibility criteria and benefits need to be  		defined for particular subpopulations, such as persons with SMI.</p>
<h3>B. Concerns of Advocacy Groups</h3>
<p>In principle, advocates for both elderly and younger persons with  		disabilities (such as the American Association of Retired Persons and the  		Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities) favor generic "functional"  		eligibility criteria that can be equitably applied across all age and  		disability groups and do not decide eligibility due to age, cause, or type of  		the disability. These viewpoints were strongly expressed at an advisory meeting  		on eligibility criteria convened by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Division of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term  		Care Policy (DALTCP) on February 18, 1994 in Washington, D.C. However, it was  		also clear that the concept of "functional" eligibility criteria means  		something quite different to advocates representing disability groups composed  		predominantly of persons under age 65 than it does to advocates for persons age  		65 and older.</p>
<p>Advocates on behalf of younger cognitively or mentally impaired  		populations are not content to define "function" in terms limited to basic ADLs  		and IADLs. They would like to see eligibility criteria that also take into  		account measures of social functioning (or age appropriate functioning) such as  		inability or impaired ability to work, attend school, form relationships and  		socialize with peers. This approach results in a much larger definition of the  		size of the severely disabled population potentially eligible for services than  		traditional definitions developed around the characteristics and needs of the  		elderly disabled. Advocates on behalf of younger disabled populations have also  		stated their preference for having "severe" disability defined in such a way  		that individuals who have multiple mild or moderate disabilities [which may  		include mental retardation/developmental disabilities (MR/DD) and SMI] could be  		determined to meet the severity threshold for program eligibility purposes.  		Finally, many advocates for younger disabled persons would like to see included  		in the benefit package services intended to help prepare individuals with  		disabilities to assume or resume social roles, such as work.</p>
<p>While advocates favor a system that does not determine eligibility by  		age or type of disability, they also voice concerns that under a federal  		program modeled after the HSA where states cannot limit eligibility by income,  		age, geography, or nature of severity and category of disability, the only  		method for cost containment may be to limit the services available. There is a  		fear that the services provided would be tailored to meet the needs of people  		with ADL, rather than IADL, cognitive, or social functioning impairments.</p>
<p>There is also concern that resolution of the above issues will be futile  		if some other fundamental problems are not first addressed. Specifically,  		advocacy groups International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation  		(IAPSRS), The American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Mental  		Health Association (NMHA)] state that legislation should ensure linkages to  		coordinate services between systems and that case management should be an  		integral service linking not only health and health-related services but  		vocational rehabilitation, education, income maintenance, and housing. The  		purpose of such an emphasis is to enhance continuity of care and provide quick  		access to services to meet the changing and intermittent needs of persons with  		SMI.</p>
<h3>C. Primary Issues Involving People with SMI and  		Long-Term Services</h3>
<p>This report focuses specifically on how alternative definitions of  		eligibility for long-term services and benefits (modeled after HCBS provisions  		within the HSA) affect the SMI population. In particular, the report will  		address in detail the following challenges that are posed by attempting to take  		into account the needs of persons with SMI in the design of a generic long-term  		care services delivery system.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><i>How to delineate the population of persons with SMI for whom  			 long-term services--as distinct from acute psychiatric or other  			 medically-oriented therapies--are appropriate.</i></p>
<p>This analytic task involves not only determining who with SMI could  			 benefit from long-term services, but also how the service needs for people with  			 SMI are comparable to those of other target groups with physical and cognitive  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Whether and how to address needs for assistance--particularly for  			 supervisory and instructional assistance--that are specifically associated with  			 mental illness and that may not be adequately captured by typical measures of  			 need for long-term services (ADLs and IADLs) or by cognitive impairment  			 measures designed for persons with dementia disorders.</i></p>
<p>This analytic task is made more difficult by the requirement to  			 distinguish supervisory help that is needed to negotiate daily life outside of  			 an institutional setting from help that may be needed to function productively  			 in an age-appropriate manner in terms of work or attending school. These  			 distinctions are the basis for drawing boundaries between programs intended to  			 finance and deliver long-term services needs with those whose purposes a-re to  			 address vocational rehabilitation or special education needs. The difficult  			 nature of defining these boundaries is particularly evident with regard to  			 children with severe emotional disturbance (SED) who may also have diagnoses of  			 MR/DD. Many experts and advocates appear to take the position that clear  			 boundaries cannot and should not be drawn between long-term services and  			 vocational rehabilitation and/or special education services for either the SMI  			 or MR/DD populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>How to define eligibility and provide services in a manner that  			 recognizes and deals with the cyclical nature of mental illness--without,  			 however, according persons with SMI preferential treatment in comparison with  			 members of other target groups.</i></p>
<p>Most persons with physical and/or cognitive disabilities have levels  			 of impairment and associated service needs that are consistent over long  			 periods of time (typically expected to last for three or more months). In  			 contrast, persons with SMI may have periods of need that would qualify them for  			 long-term services, but they are also capable of achieving significant  			 improvements in functioning and then again experiencing crises that can return  			 them to severe levels of functional disability. In these periods of  			 improvement, people with SMI may no longer qualify for services restricted to  			 persons with severe disabilities. Nevertheless, many experts argue for  			 continued service provision to prevent acute exacerbation of symptoms. Thus,  			 there is concern that the bureaucratic gatekeeping mechanisms that restrict  			 access to long-term services to a target population of severely disabled  			 individuals--and which typically impose a lengthy period to establish or to  			 re-establish program eligibility--may be particularly ill-suited to meet the  			 service needs of the SMI population.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON PERSONS WITH  		SMI</a></h2>
<p>Before describing the background data on persons with SMI, clarification  		of terminology is necessary. The terms impairment, disability, and handicap are  		often used interchangeably but are actually quite different and can result in  		varied interpretations of the eligible population and cost of a long-term  		services program.<a href="#note3"><font>3</font></a> Definitions of  		and differences between cognitive and mental impairment must be clear as well.  		Mental health professionals identify cognitive impairment and mental illness  		separately; a person who has a SM may or may not be cognitively impaired. It is  		important to recognize this distinction and not group these individuals into  		one category.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the differences in how mental health  		professionals conceptualize services for the SMI population as compared with  		how professionals (e.g. geriatricians and gerontologists) categorize the  		service needs of the disabled elderly. Long-term care services for the elderly  		have been defined primarily as assistance with ADLs and IADLs, often excluding  		rehabilitative services such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies  		that are considered to be acute or post-acute (medical and skilled-care) and  		oriented toward achieving improvements, rather than providing assistance, in  		ADL/IADL functioning. Moreover, the equivalent to psychosocial rehabilitative  		services (often used by persons with SMI--discussed in section C below) for  		treating mental disorders is difficult to identify for older persons with  		traditional long-term care needs (needs resulting from cognitive, not mental  		impairment). Cognitive impairment in the elderly is usually the result of  		Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, or other underlying conditions  		that are irreversible degenerative diseases which are not responsive to drugs  		or other therapeutic treatments. "Psychosocial" services for persons with  		dementia disorders tend to focus on behavioral psychology methods for managing  		symptoms (such as emotional agitation) and behavior problems (such as wandering  		and aggression). As will be discussed below, mental health professionals do not  		make the same distinctions between medical and non-medical or "social" services  		and between rehabilitative versus supportive services.</p>
<h3>A. Description of the SMI Population</h3>
<h4>1. Size of the population</h4>
<p>In the field of mental health, the characteristics of diagnosis,  		disability, and duration have been used to determine past and present estimates  		of people with SMI. In 1981 the term chronically mentally ill was used and  		included those with a diagnosis for a major mental illness, severe disability,  		and a duration of illness for at least one year (1.5% of the U.S. population  		ages 18+ qualified). Later the terminology changed and referred to the severely  		and persistently mentally ill, including all mental illness diagnoses and all  		severe disabilities with a one year duration (estimates ranged from 2.1-2.6% to  		2.8 and 3.2% of the U.S. population ages 18+). The most recent definition  		refers to persons with severe mental illness, which includes all diagnoses,  		substantial disability, and no required duration (some estimates show this as  		encompassing 5-7% of the U.S. population ages 18+).<a href="#note4"><font>4</font></a> The definitions of SMI and the estimates of the  		population have changed in attempts to encompass the heterogeneous group of  		persons with SMI. While the most recent definition involves more people, it  		also captures those who have intermittent periods of serious mental illness  		over a long period of time (CMHS, 1992).</p>
<p><i>Serious Mental Illness and Disability in the Adult Household  		Population: United States, 1989</i> (using data from the 1989 National Health  		Interview Survey mental health supplement) estimates that 3.3 million people 18  		years of age or older had a SMI (a serious mental illness<a href="#note5"><font>5</font></a> resulting in disability for at least one year) in the  		past 12 months; 2.6 million of these individuals had specific limitations in  		work, school, personal care, social functioning, concentrating, or coping with  		day-today stress; and 1.4 million adults between the ages of 18 and 69 were  		unable to work.<a href="#note6"><font>6</font></a> Since family  		members served as respondents for some of the individuals, the validity of such  		data depends on the person's or family's awareness and willingness to report  		mental illness regardless of stigma; such concerns suggest that the prevalence  		rate of SMI is probably underestimated.</p>
<p>Another major source of data on adults with SMI is the Epidemiological  		Catchment Area (ECA) study, a survey from 1980-1985 sponsored by the National  		Institute of Mental Health (Regier et al., 1993; NAMHC, 1993). The ECA  		estimates that in a one-year period 2-3% of the population were affected by  		severe mental disorders (approximately five million people in 1990). While the  		ECA estimates are useful and provide insightful information when used along  		with other data sources (Manderscheid et al., 1993), the ECA survey must be  		interpreted carefully as it is not nationally representative.</p>
<p>For children, little reliable data exists. The 1992 National Institute  		of Mental Health (NIMH) Cooperative Agreement for Methodologic Research for  		Multi-Site Epidemiologic Surveys of Mental Disorders in Child and Adolescent  		Populations, which cannot be generalized to the entire population, states that  		3.2% of the sample ages 9-17 had a severe mental disorder. NCHS states that  		among children ages 3-17, 13.4% have an emotional or behavioral problem. These  		estimates vary greatly due to the differences in defining the population, as  		well as the lack of information available. More information, however, on  		children with mental illness and long-term service needs will be available in  		the next five to seven years. NIMH will be conducting a multi-site study of 30  		different programs and the effectiveness of service delivery and need for  		mental health services for children between the ages of four and seventeen.</p>
<p>More information about SMI and disability will also be available from  		the Disability Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey. Data from  		round one of this supplement is currently being collected. For adults who  		report a need for assistance in (or that they get help performing) ADLs and/or  		IADLs, information about the condition causing the need for assistance is  		collected. In addition, an entire section of the survey is devoted to questions  		about mental health: specific diagnosis of mental. disorder; feelings of  		depression or anxiety; trouble making or keeping friendships; getting along  		with people in social settings; the ability to concentrate long enough to  		complete everyday tasks; and how these and other problems interfere with the  		person's ability to work or attend school. Persons are also surveyed about  		services they have used: programs that assist in developing skills for  		employment; programs that provide social, recreational, and developmental  		activities; and other programs that provide case management, occupational  		therapy, or other services. Specific questions addressed to children include  		measures of disability by looking at the use of health care services (e.g.  		going to a counselor or psychiatrist on a regular basis), delays in mental  		development, and problems getting along with others. The education section of  		the supplement addresses reasons for not attending school and behavior problems  		in school.<a href="#note7"><font>7</font></a></p>
<h4>2. Other characteristics of persons with SMI</h4>
<p>Information about the living arrangements of persons with SMI is not  		available at the national level. A survey by the Alliance for the Mentally  		Ill/New York State, though not nationally representative, is a rare source of  		information. The survey showed that 41 % of persons with mental illness live  		with family members (information on specific family members lived with is not  		available), 28% have some type of employment, 24% have structured daytime  		programs, 11% attend school, and 14% do volunteer work. Forty-six percent had  		no particular activity in which they spent most of their time (partly because  		part-time jobs or structured programs occupy only portions of their day). Forty  		percent of those surveyed have been arrested at some time, and other problems  		include difficulty concentrating (79%), impaired judgement (74%), withdrawal  		around others (60%), and suicide attempts (37%). This survey does not break  		down its information by severity of the illness (e.g. if the person has a SMI).  		Also, this was a mail survey which had a low response rate (42%) of usable  		questionnaires (Grosser and Vine, 1991).</p>
<p>About 703,000, or 23.2 percent of adults with SMI receive disability  		payments [through Social Security and Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental  		Security Income (SSI), or the Veteran's Administration] because of their mental  		disorder. For persons with SMI, SSDI (46%) and SSI (43.5%) were the most  		reported payments (Barker et al., 1992). In the SSDI and the SSI programs, the  		largest percent of beneficiaries are receiving payments on a disability due to  		a mental disorder (Kennedy and Manderscheid, 1992). For SSI and SSDI, a  		disability is inability to engage in substantial gainful activity because of a  		physical or mental impairment that will result in death or has lasted (or will  		last) for not less than twelve months. There are also non- medical  		requirements: sufficient work history (SSDI) and low income (SSI). In 1991, 23%  		of disabled workers received SSDI benefits because of a mental disorder and  		21.4% individuals received SSI benefits because of a mental disorder. These  		numbers must be interpreted with caution, as a mental disorder is not  		equivalent to having a SMI. It is interesting to note, however, that the number  		of SSI recipients disabled by a mental disorder increased 80% between 1986 and  		1991 (Frank and McGuire, 1994).</p>
<h3>B. Service Use and Needs of Persons with SMI</h3>
<p>Efforts in the past twenty years toward finding more effective  		alternatives to institutionalization for persons with SMI have led to the  		development of psychiatric rehabilitation services, also known as psychosocial  		rehabilitation, a term that encompasses several types of community-based mental  		health treatments. Current funding for much of these services occurs through  		the rehabilitation or clinic options of state Medicaid programs. More than  		2,000 agencies provide these services throughout the United States. Not all  		persons with a mental illness require psychosocial rehabilitation services; the  		most frequent diagnoses of persons needing the service include schizophrenia,  		manic depressive disorders, depression, and severe personality disorders  		(Hughes, 1994).</p>
<p>Psychosocial rehabilitation serves to meet several non-medical needs of  		persons with SMI: assistance with social relationships, recreation, vocational  		skills, and self-care. Psychosocial rehabilitation's goal is to enable  		individuals to compensate for or eliminate functional deficits, 1 interpersonal  		barriers and environmental barriers, and to restore ability for independent  		living, socialization, and effective life management. After an assessment  		process, a rehabilitation or treatment plan is developed. Through activities of  		psychosocial rehabilitation, skills are learned involving daily living, social  		interactions, and problem solving. The activities of such programs are designed  		to represent the real activities of every day life, thus much of the  		rehabilitation must occur within the community (Hughes, 1994).</p>
<h4>1. Models of service delivery</h4>
<h5><i>The TCL Model and PACT</i></h5>
<p>The Training in Community Living (TCL) model developed in the 1970s in  		Wisconsin. TCL is an intensive program of community care where a team provides  		a full range of medical, psychosocial, and rehabilitation services. The  		rationale for TCL is that "...ubiquitous to the field of community treatment  		and rehabilitation is the question of how to deliver this range of services and  		supports in a way which reaches the target population in a timely fashion--that  		is, in a manner which optimizes the chances that clients and significant others  		will receive what they need, when they need it" (Test, 1990). TCL emphasizes  		continuity of care through a core services team, assertive outreach, and  		individualized, on-going treatment. Assertive outreach involves actively going  		out to meet the client's needs in the community. Attention is continuously  		given to symptom management through help with medications, 24-hour crisis  		availability, brief hospitalizations, and one-to-one relationships. In  		addition, support is given to family members. Evaluation results of TCL have  		been very positive. TCL patients spent more time in independent living  		situations, and showed more favorable community adjustment in the areas of  		employment, social relationships, symptomatology, and satisfaction with their  		life, as well as effectiveness in reducing hospitalization (Test, 1990).</p>
<p>An example of psychosocial rehabilitation that is modeled on TCL is the  		Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT). PACT is a community-based  		program targeted to those who have multiple episodes of illness, drug  		non-compliance, and high use of psychiatric hospitalizations and other  		services. Since PACT is an intensive approach to reducing symptoms and  		preventing relapse, it is often only indicated for a small proportion of those  		with a SMI. Within PACT, the staff to client ratio is 1:10-12. Each team is  		required to have a wide range of professional skills including social work,  		psychiatric nursing, occupational therapy, psychology, rehabilitation  		counseling, and psychiatry (Test et al.; Burns). Services provided under the  		PACT program used in South Carolina are outlined on the next page.<a href="#note8"><font>8</font></a></p>
<p>A number of strong positive findings have been reported in PACT  		research. All of the trials report more independent living for PACT clients at  		follow-up. Hospital admissions and length of stay were significantly lower for  		PACT clients in all but one study and cost-effectiveness has been demonstrated.  		Perceived quality of life was more positive for PACT clients in eight out of  		nine studies. Finally, gains in instrumental functioning and community living  		skills were greater for PACT clients in the majority of studies where this was  		assessed. Other effects were not so strong, including symptom reduction, social  		functioning, employment status, and medication compliance. However, the  		researchers involved in PACT argue that sufficient evidence exists to merit  		continued research on this model. Currently, PACT is in statewide use in  		Delaware, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Another 20 states have several  		PACT teams.<a href="#note9"><font>9</font></a></p>

</tr></table><p>The evaluation of Michigan's model of PACT and TCL, known as ACT,  		followed 1000 clients two years before participation in ACT and four years  		after; there will also be an eight year follow-up. For these clients,  		hospitalization rates decreased 70% after the first year and 90% after four  		years. ACT teams are also beginning to address the needs of subgroups: special  		teams have started to address the needs of older persons who have SMI, as well  		as those with a dual diagnosis of substance abuse and/or who have criminal  		records.</p>
<h5><i>Clubhouses</i></h5>
<p>In addition to TCL, PACT, and ACT, another form of psychosocial  		rehabilitation is the clubhouse model which, instead of serving individuals  		primarily in their homes, brings people to one central location in the  		community to participate in daily activities. In clubhouse models, people who  		join become members and are expected to play some role in the functioning of  		the organization. Many activities in the daily operations of the organization  		(such as bookkeeping or preparing meals) performed by members. Clubhouse models  		also offer assistance in obtaining employment and housing. Way Station is a  		clubhouse located in Frederick, Maryland, which has shown several positive  		results. At Way Station, the cost of serving a member averages $20,000 per  		year, while the cost per person at a state mental facility averages four to  		five times this amount (based on a full-year length of stay). Way Station has  		also helped its members sustain a low psychiatric hospitalization rate of  		4.75%.</p>
<p>The previous discussion of TCL, PACT, and clubhouses indicates that  		various psychosocial treatment programs demonstrate positive effects. An  		important question to ask, however, is whether these programs will be effective  		over many years when treating persons with SMI who cycle in and out of the  		mental health system and need long-term services. DeSisto et al. (1994)  		examined the long-term outcomes (follow-ups of 32 and 36 years) of psychiatric  		rehabilitation by comparing two states, Maine (traditional care) and Vermont  		(rehabilitation). A sample of 269 persons were matched on age, gender,  		diagnosis, and chronicity. Overall, Vermont subjects still living at follow-up  		were more productive, had fewer symptoms, better community adjustment, and  		global functioning than Maine subjects. The issue then becomes whether or not  		the differences in outcomes were or were not due to Vermont's program which  		allowed an earlier opportunity for community life. The authors argue that the  		differences, after adjustment, are likely to be attributed to the Vermont  		program. What may be more difficult, however, is generalizing these results  		(average age of 65 at follow-up) to the current group of younger people with  		SMI because of cohort differences.</p>
<h4>2. Existing patterns of service use</h4>
<p>Specific information on utilization of community-based mental health  		services by persons with SMI is not readily available. Many community-based  		psychosocial rehabilitation centers have developed recently or are small  		organizations, and there has been little data collection that is useful for  		policymakers interested in issues related to long-term services. If some data  		are available, different methods for collecting this information makes  		comparisons between centers difficult. Furthermore, available surveys describe  		utilization of treatments for mental disorders with a highly medical focus and  		do not provide specific information on social or long-term services (i.e.  		psychosocial or vocational rehabilitation). More nationally representative data  		are needed to estimate what specific social, long-term, and community-based  		services of mental health programs are used most often by individuals with  		different levels of functioning. However, the mental health field has not  		traditionally divided its services into acute and long- term services, making  		it more difficult to assess the amount of "long-term care" that is used by  		people with SMI.</p>
<p>Way Station, a community-based mental health program in Frederick, MD,  		has attempted some assembly of data by looking at the utilization of services  		among different groups who were categorized by the Global Assessment of  		Functioning (GAF) Scale. GAF scores range from 1 to 90; ninety indicating  		absent or minimal symptoms and good functioning in all areas, and a score  		between 1 and 10 indicating persistent danger to self or others or inability to  		maintain minimal personal hygiene. Way Station divided individuals into four  		groups, with group one having the lowest GAF scores, and group four the  		highest. The hours of service utilized per week were (with percent of  		membership in parentheses): group one (22%)=40; group two (46%)=38; group three  		(30%)=27; group four (2%)=5.<a href="#note10"><font>10</font></a>  		Services that were included in utilization hours were club (adult medical  		daycare and psychiatric rehabilitation services), clinic (verbal and/or  		chemotherapy management), housing (psychiatric rehabilitation in supervised  		houses), outreach (provided at member's home or in the community), and  		intensive support services (24 hour crisis management services).</p>
<p>Some general information about service utilization at a national level  		is available. Narrow et al. (1993) used data from the ECA and looked at the  		treated SMI population and what settings individuals went to, the number of  		visits per setting and per person, and a breakdown of information by disorder  		and type of service. This survey of adults shows that 14.7% of the US  		population (not just those with SMI) reported use of mental health services,  		irrespective of diagnosis; of those with a mental disorder only 28.5% sought  		services. The ECA also looked at service use-rates for specialty mental and  		addictive disorders (SMA), general medical/nursing home (GM), human services  		(HS), and voluntary support network (VSN). For the total population the  		utilization was: SMA=5.9%; GM=6.4%; HS=3 % (includes clergy or religious  		counselors); and VSN=4. I% (includes self-help groups and relatives or  		friends). While 28.1% of the sample was affected with SMI only about half  		receive care; the lowest service percentage receiving service were individuals  		with severe cognitive impairment. Of the VSN group, most service is provided  		through family and friends, which shows the burden placed on informal  		caregivers.</p>
<h4>3. Survey-based estimates of service need</h4>
<p>A model of the Community Support System (CSS), developed in Ohio, is an  		establishment of an array of services including outreach, housing,  		emergency/crisis response, medication, vocational, and other services to meet  		the needs of individual clients.<a href="#note11"><font>11</font></a>  		In a survey of CSS case managers regarding the needs of a randomly selected  		group of clients, three major categories of need for persons with SMI were  		found: (1) supplemental services to support case management, (2) day program  		services, and (3) residential programs. Examples of supplements to case  		management include: psychotropic medication monitoring and home-based medical  		support, substance abuse treatment services, budgeting and protective payee  		services, counseling, support groups, and specialized therapy. Forty percent of  		respondents stated the need for day program services which include social clubs  		and social functioning opportunities, specialized programs for higher and lower  		functioning clients, and expanded vocational training and supported employment  		efforts. Fifty-two percent of the respondents described a need for  		housing/residential service, and 24% for subsidized apartments (three times the  		current number available). Other cited needs include group homes or structured  		residential programs and residential programs targeted toward a special  		sub-population, such as those with a dual diagnosis of substance abuse or  		mental retardation (Ford et al., 1992).</p>
<p>A mail survey in New York state had similar results to those mentioned  		above, demonstrating the need for increased housing. Most individuals also  		needed help with meals, household chores, and money management. This sample is  		not representative, as people who are homeless are not accounted for in the  		sample, and children, lower-income families, and minorities were under-  		represented; the findings, however, are consistent with other surveys (Grosser  		and Vine, 1991).</p>
<h3>C. Financing of Services for Persons with SMI</h3>
<p>State governments are largely responsible for mental health services,  		especially services for individuals with SMI and persons who are poor. It is  		difficult to analyze the revenues and expenditures to form a national picture  		of financing because states structure their mental health systems differently.  		Furthermore, obtaining information on the financing of "long-term care  		services" is difficult because this distinction is not made in the field of  		mental health. Nevertheless, a general picture of the financing can be obtained  		from Frank and McGuire (1994). They estimate that $54 billion was spent on  		mental health and substance abuse services (community and institutional  		services) in the U.S. in 1990. Of this $54 billion, 33% was accountable to a  		relatively small group of persons: the uninsured with a SMI (who account for  		2.2% of the population). Costs for these uninsured are paid for through various  		local, state, and federal programs (also known as public mental health care).  		The rest of the $54 billion is allocated to those with private insurance  		(41.1%), Medicare (4%), Medicaid (17.6%), and the uninsured who do not have a  		SMI (4%). Only 3% of Medicare payments are due to utilization of mental health  		and substance abuse benefits. Medicaid, as the authors note, is much more  		complicated to explain due to its joint federal/state nature and its mixture of  		mandated benefits and optional state benefits. In addition to Medicare and  		Medicaid, public mental health cam accounted for approximately 59% of all  		expenditures on mental health services in 1990. Public mental health involves  		services provided by facilities that are publicly owned, public insurance  		programs (e.g. Medicaid) that are used to purchase mental health services from  		a range of provider types, and direct purchase of mental health services by  		state or local government form private service providers. In addition to these  		sources of funding, there are intergovernmental transfers among the three  		levels of government.</p>
<p>No recent work has been done that explains how community-based services  		such as PACT programs or clubhouses are funded. Anecdotal evidence shows that  		PACT programs "negotiate" with states to determine which PACT services can be  		reimbursed through Medicaid and which services must be financed through the  		development of other mechanisms. More than 30 states have the rehabilitation  		option; these are the states whose community-based programs are paid with  		larger portions of Medicaid.<a href="#note12"><font>12</font></a> As  		an example of a program at the local level, Way Station receives 52% of its  		revenues from Medicaid, 29% from the Maryland Department of Mental Hygiene, 12%  		from members, 5% from Medicare, 1% from contributions, and 1% from other  		sources. While it is unclear exactly how community-based mental health  		services, particularly long-term care services, are funded, it is clear that  		some states do no utilize Medicaid at all, whereas other states use Medicaid to  		fund a large portion of these services. For the states that fund a large  		proportion of "long-term care services" through Medicaid, the availability of  		these services to persons with SMI could change dramatically if modifications  		are made to the Medicaid program.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. POLICY IMPLICATIONS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Options for Establishing Eligibility Criteria for  		Long-Term Services</h3>
<p>One of the difficulties in establishing a long-term services benefit  		that covers a diverse population is ensuring that the eligibility criteria are  		suitable, equitable, and capture the most severely disabled of various  		disability groups. Many proposals for health care reform throughout 1994  		included long-term care provisions with eligibility criteria requiring severe  		mental or cognitive impairment and need for assistance in ADLs or IADLs.  		Considerable debate has occurred regarding the appropriate choice of  		eligibility, criteria, whether eligibility should only be based on functioning,  		without looking at the cause of the disability, or if diagnostic measures  		should be used along with the functioning screens. Because the needs (measured  		with ADLs and IADLs) of elderly persons have traditionally been the focus in  		determining the eligibility for long-term care, the validity of using these  		measures should come under scrutiny when determining eligibility for a program  		that targets additional disability groups under the age of 65, including  		persons with SMI. Even though the HCBS provisions of the HSA included a  		separate list of criteria for mental or cognitive impairment, this particular  		criterion also stated that need had to be demonstrated by ADL or IADL  		dependencies.</p>
<h4>1. GAF scores and service need</h4>
<p>In one of the estimates to determine the eligible population for the  		HSA, the number of persons with a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score  		of 40 or less,<a href="#note13"><font>13</font></a> in combination  		with limitations in three ADLS (or a combination of three ADLs and IADLs) were  		estimated. The result of the analysis, conducted by Dr. Susan Bassett of Johns  		Hopkins, was an eligible population within the entire United States of .05  		percent (excludes those with cognitive impairment, i.e. individuals with  		primarily Alzheimer's and other dementias and those above age 65, as well as  		individuals with mental retardation). This analysis results in a small number  		of people with SMI who would be eligible for long-term services, but if the  		criteria used only IADL limitations (not combinations of GAF, ADLs, and IADLs),  		the eligible population expands to the point where the benefit becomes  		financially unmanageable.</p>
<h4>2. Combinations of ADLs and IADLs</h4>
<p>A second method of determining eligibility is using ADL and IADL scales  		similar to that in the proposed HSA. The benefit of using IADLs along with ADLs  		is that considerable agreement exists that IADLs are a better indicator of  		disability than the ADL criteria for people with SMI. Results of analyses of  		the 1989 Mental Health Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey  		(NHIS) of the household population show that persons with a diagnosis of a  		severe mental illness have difficulty primarily with IADLs, and very few report  		problems with ADLs only. For example, of the 3,264 individuals with a SMI, 2.7%  		of the population 18-69 years of age had limitations in personal care ADLs,  		while 22.9% of this population had limitations in IADLs. For the population 70  		years of age and above, 24.3% had limitations in personal care ADLs and 62.3%  		in the IADLs (Barker et al., 1992). IADLs that were measured included managing  		money, doing everyday household chores, shopping, and getting around outside  		the home. Analysis of data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation  		(SIPP) shows similar trends: for individuals ages 18-64, 90,000 of those with  		mental illness need help in three or more ADLs (I 09,000 for age 65+), while  		219,000 need help in a combination of three or more ADLs or IADLs (189,000 for  		age 65+).<a href="#note14"><font>14</font></a> While SIPP and the  		NHIS provide some estimates of the number of people with SW, questions arise  		about whether other eligibility criteria and sources of data would be more  		useful in capturing those people who have a SMI and need long-term services.<a href="#note15"><font>15</font></a> Furthermore, showing level of  		severity with IADLs versus ADLs is difficult, because no hierarchy exists among  		the IADLs.</p>
<h4>3. Executive cognitive function</h4>
<p>A third, less-known method for determining eligibility in people with  		cognitive and mental impairments is the Cognitive Dysfunction test, which was  		developed by researchers at Brown University and the University of Texas.  		Although the subject of considerable debate, Fogel et al. (1994) argue that one  		test which measures executive cognitive fim6tions (ECF), the functions which  		allow persons to engage in goal-directed behavior, (as well as ability to plan,  		use judgment, follow through on activities, and exercise self control) can be  		used as an eligibility determinant for all <i>mentally and cognitively</i>  		impaired populations and predict the need for long-term services among these  		groups. They state that tests of ECF address the insufficient ability of  		physical and cognitive screens to capture those individuals with a SMI. The  		rationale behind ECF is that "a person with impaired cognitive function (ECF)  		may have completely adequate physical and sensory function, and adequate  		cognitive function in many areas, but still not be able to function safely and  		appropriately or to carry out necessary activities of daily living." An example  		is a person who can walk without difficulty, but who cannot walk to a specific  		destination to accomplish a certain task. The developers of ECF indicate that  		this criteria could be used for persons with physical disabilities; they  		believe that executive deficits undermine the independence of elderly persons  		and lead to the expression of behavior problems in nursing homes. The problem  		with implementing an entirely new screening test such as the ECF is that there  		are no national surveys to accurately estimate the eligible population or costs  		of the program. Furthermore, this method has not been generally appreciated due  		to practical limits in formal testing (Royall et al., 1993).</p>
<h4>4. Use of individual states' criteria</h4>
<p>To address the limitations of the previous measures, consideration of  		other methods to determine eligibility should be examined, including methods  		used at the state level. Schinnar et al. (1990) conducted a study that looked  		at whether the populations of chronic mentally ill patients were comparable  		across states and if state estimates could be used in developing a national  		estimate of this population. The study applied the definitions of chronic  		mental illness from ten states to a representative sample of patients receiving  		public mental health services in Philadelphia. The prevalence of chronically  		mentally ill persons ranged from a low of 38 percent to a high of 72 percent.  		In another study, Schinnar et al. (1990) applied eligibility criteria from  		seventeen definitions of severe and persistent mental illness in the literature  		over the past decade. The variance was even greater, ranging from four to 88  		percent. As the authors note, variance is not only caused by different  		definitions of eligibility, but also in they manner that the criteria are  		operationalized and because of sub-state variation at the county and local  		levels (states may have an overall definition of SMI, but additional  		eligibility criteria are used for different programs). A sample of the various  		criteria used to determine eligibility for services in the SMI population among  		different states is listed below.<a href="#note16"><font>16</font></a></p>
<p>Despite the lack of national data on patterns of long-term care services  		use and needs of the SMI population, there is a clear conceptual consensus  		among mental health experts on how to define the SMI target population for  		long-term services. The experts agree that eligibility criteria should target  		persons with SMI who are at high risk of multiple and/or longstay mental  		hospital admissions and who need services that would be financed under a  		long-term care program. Conceptually, this approach meets a preliminary test of  		promoting parity across disability groups, because most severely disabled  		persons among other disability groups are individuals who are considered to be  		either "at risk" or likely to be eligible to seek placement in institutional or  		alternative community-based residential care settings. What is less clear,  		however, is whether a <b>single</b> set of eligibility criteria can distinguish  		a limited size group of individuals across all age groups and  		diagnosis/condition categories.</p>
<p>For example, based on analyses of the 1989 National Long-Term Care  		Survey (NLTCS), it appears that the elderly population with dementia, defining  		"severe cognitive impairment" by means of a certain combination of IADL  		impairments is feasible. Persons aged 65 and older who require assistance with  		at least three out of four specific IADLS (meal preparation, telephoning, money  		management, and medication management) show patterns of service use (measured  		in terms of formal/informal caregiver hours received weekly and number of hours  		that the primary caregiver reports that the care recipient can be safely left  		alone) that are comparable to those of elders who have three ADL impairments or  		who score as "severely cognitively impaired" by virtue of their error scores on  		the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Unfortunately, it is  		not currently possible to obtain comparable measures for persons with SMI  		having this same profile of IADL impairments. Not only are there no comparable  		data available on hours of formal/informal service use among the SMI  		population, nationally representative surveys of persons with SMI do not even  		include all four of the relevant IADL measures (medication management is  		missing). Thus, it is impossible to estimate how many persons with SMI have  		this particular profile of at least three out of the four IADLs listed  		above.</p>

</tr></table><p>Given the previous descriptions of state definitions of the target  		population of SMI and the options for determining eligibility for a program  		offering long-term services, several unresolved issues remain. The list of  		states' definitions and options for eligibility criteria described within this  		report are not finite. Many more options exist, but are not described. And  		among the options that have been described, no clear criteria emerge as the  		best method. It is also not clear that allowing states to develop their own  		definitions is the best route for determining eligibility. There is substantial  		variation in how states define their target population. Some states use very  		general guidelines, others have very detailed criteria. This variation may or  		may not be beneficial. If states are appropriately serving persons with SMI,  		allowing state flexibility may be the best way to continue determining  		eligibility for services. However, determining if the state's definition works  		well, especially since sub-state variation occurs, is very difficult.</p>
<h3>B. Are the Needs of Persons with SMI Addressed by  		Long-Term Services?</h3>
<p>Benefits proposed in the HSA's HCBS provisions included a requirement of  		states to provide personal assistance services and the flexibility to include  		as many of the following services: case management, homemaker and chore  		assistance, home modifications, respite care, assistive technology, adult day  		services, home health, habilitation and rehabilitation, and supported  		employment. A key issue is determining whether traditional long-term services  		and the above list of benefits would appropriately serve individuals with SMI.  		Case management services are an example of the complexity of this issue. Case  		or team management is a beneficial service for individuals with SMI. What  		becomes problematic is that the definition of case management can vary widely.  		Some models of community-based mental health services emphasize an intensive  		team approach to monitoring patients, involving daily interaction with clients  		in their own living environments. This is quite different from using case  		managers who interact with a client once per week in a facility outside of the  		clients home. The costs and. outcomes of these two approaches can vary widely  		due to differences in case management staffing, work load, client  		characteristics, and service intensity.</p>
<p>A further example of the issues related to defining benefits can be  		shown with the case management design within the Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ)  		demonstrations. RWJ announced its initiative in December 1985 with the goal to  		strengthen the potential of individuals with SMI to live independently. The  		demonstration operated on the belief that it was possible to connect previously  		alienated service sectors such as mental health and housing through case  		management. A service integration approach was used to enhance the possibility  		of creating innovative solutions to service delivery problems. The goals of the  		demonstrations were to ensure continuity of care, flexible financing, a range  		of housing options, and an enhanced range of rehabilitation programs. An  		evaluation of the RWJ demonstrations found improved continuity of care in three  		out of four cities that were studied, yet analysis was unable to detect  		improvements in client outcomes, and psychiatric symptoms were even worse in  		the second cohort studied. The RWJ demonstration succeeded in advancing  		structural goals and improving continuity of care, yet no significant  		improvements were found in quality of life even though satisfaction of clients  		was high. In any future demonstrations examining the efficacy of case  		management, these results indicate a need to focus on clinical and social care  		as well as organization and financing when designing a system which relies  		highly on case management. While coordination is important, some energy should  		focus on creating the services that people really need because case management  		alone is not enough.</p>
<p>An additional problem can be demonstrated with the case management  		benefit, as complications occur when trying to determine what services a  		long-term care benefit will cover. For example, if psychiatrists and social  		workers are members of a case management team, would it be a medical or  		long-term services benefit? Case management is not the only benefit where these  		issues become increasingly difficult. For example, are some clubhouses for  		persons with SMI analogous to adult day services provided to elderly  		individuals, even if the clubhouses provide other services such as employment  		and housing assistance? Those involved in clubhouse models of care emphasize  		that although the clubhouse is assisting in "employment" by having an  		individual work in and/or outside the facility, the benefit received is really  		a long-term service benefit because the ability to concentrate on and complete  		an entire task is being enhanced, thus increasing independence and  		self-sufficiency.</p>

</tr></table><p>The prominent issue is determining if there can be universal definitions  		of benefits for varied disability groups. To help analyze this issue, a  		comparison of psychosocial rehabilitation (PACT model) for the SMI population  		and the Program of All-Inclusive care for the Elderly (PACE) is given below.  		Please note that psychosocial rehabilitation encompasses many services, and the  		description of PACT given below may vary within specific PACT programs.</p>
<p>From the above comparisons, many similarities are evident. Both focus on  		the most severely impaired segments of the population. Both have the goal of  		keeping individuals in the community. Efforts are made through both programs to  		enhance the continuity of care. The commonalities of traditional long-term  		services and services needed by those with SMI are evident; the biggest  		differences appear to be the need for employment assistance for individuals  		with SMI, as well as the cyclical nature of the illness.</p>
<h3>C. Additional issues</h3>
<h4>1. Children</h4>
<p>When looking at children, a primary concern is determining whether or  		not they are under the rubric of long-term services. In a policy paper endorsed  		by the APA, IAPSRS, NASMHPD, and the NMHA, it was stated that children with  		mental or emotional disorders cannot be clearly identified as having a  		disabling mental illness until they reach late adolescence and that the needs  		of children can be met in a reformed health care system, not through long-term  		care and services. (Although a small proportion of children may still need  		long-term services.) Others would argue that it is not important how these  		services are labeled, but that the services are available and accessible.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing children is the lack of  		coordination of information between families, the educational system, and the  		medical profession. The juvenile justice system has a different perception of  		what constitutes emotional disturbance than the mental health profession, and  		the legal system does not have a good understanding of mental health needs and  		vice versa. There are also problems within the mental health system itself. In  		a 1982 study, the Children's Defense Fund found striking differences among the  		states. Only 21 states had a designated child and adolescent mental health  		staff person, only seven states could report how much money was spent on  		children, and many states had no separate standards for children. Compounding  		the above problems is the lack of services and supports to parents of troubled  		children to assist them in navigating through a complex and uncoordinated  		system.</p>
<p>Finally, a current policy concern is deciding how to define mental  		impairment in children for purposes of eligibility for the SSI program.  		Anecdotal evidence suggests that some children with behavior disorders  		currently receiving SSI are not disabled enough to warrant receipt of benefits  		and that families are coaching children to act in a certain manner in order to  		receive benefits. Proposals on Capitol Hill have addressed this concern by  		eliminating the "maladaptive behavior" criterion for SSI, an elimination which  		is questionable in its effectiveness.</p>
<h4>2. Caregivers</h4>
<p>Since informal caregivers provide a substantial amount of care, the  		ability to offer benefits to assist them and to establish criteria that  		captures high caregiver burden and stress is crucial. While one of the stresses  		caregivers face is the stigma of having a family member with SMI, what often is  		more troublesome is the continued presence of severe symptoms and the cyclical  		nature of the illness. Studies on the impact of families who care for someone  		with mental illness reveal that all aspects of a caregiver's life can be  		affected. Just as the nature of mental illness is dynamic, so are the needs of  		individuals with SMI and their caregivers. Problems faced by caregivers include  		fears about the future, difficulty with the unpredictable nature of SMI, and  		struggles in relationships and communication. Even though studies of caregiving  		show that caregivers sometimes participate in support groups, they still feel a  		lack of understanding of their problems by others (Lefley, 1989).</p>
<p>If a major stressor for caregivers are the cyclical and extreme  		behaviors of people with SMI, should the eligibility criteria address these  		characteristics? Fogel et al. (1994) argue that "Measurements of executive  		cognitive dysfunction complement measures of physical dependency in determining  		the amount of effort caregivers must make"; implying that eligibility criteria  		can be designed to measure caregiver burden. The ability of eligibility  		criteria to capture the stress of caregivers may be difficult to determine, but  		such criteria could ensure that appropriate benefits are targeted toward  		caregivers who are experiencing a great amount of stress, if this is an  		important goal.</p>
<h4>3. Homeless persons with SMI</h4>
<p>Individuals who are homeless also have needs that are difficult to  		identify and address. It is estimated that of the approximately 600,000 people  		homeless on any given day, 200,000 of these individuals are suffering from SM.  		What increases the severity of the situation is lack of income, insufficient  		social supports, and problems with alcohol or drug abuse. The assistance needed  		by homeless individuals with SMI is similar to the benefits needed by other  		groups of people with SMI, but these individuals need other services as well to  		assist them in a complex and uncoordinated environment: housing, alcohol and  		drug abuse treatment, health care and treatment of mental illness, and income  		support and benefits. It is unclear how the provision of long-term services  		would affect those who are homeless and have a SMI. But to qualify for  		long-term services, these individuals would obviously need to be determined  		eligible. Assertive outreach would be necessary to reach the appropriate  		individuals so that the system can assist them (Federal Task Force on  		Homelessness and SMI, 1992).</p>
<h4>4. Substance abuse and persons with SMI</h4>
<p>The needs of the homeless relate to an additional problem, individuals  		who have a dual diagnosis of substance abuse and mental illness. It is often  		not clear what caused the substance or drug abuse problem, but what is clear is  		that this makes receiving successful assistance with a mental illness more  		difficult, especially for homeless individuals because housing programs often  		will not accept people with substance abuse problems, even though the  		individual may not be capable of finding accessible treatment. The number of  		people with this problem is large. According to the analysis by Kessler et al.  		(1994) of The National Comorbidity Study, 45% of individuals with at least one  		lifetime alcohol abuse disorder reported a co-occurring mental illness; 72%  		with a life time history of drug abuse reported alcohol abuse, mental illness,  		or both; and 29% of those. with a mental disorder have a alcohol or drug abuse  		problem.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIV" id="sectionIV">IV. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Given the information presented in this report, what can be concluded  		about the major policy issues presented at the beginning: delineating the SMI  		population with long-term, versus acute care needs; meeting the needs of  		persons with SMI through appropriate eligibility criteria; and addressing the  		cyclical nature of SMI?</p>
<p>The first issue is whether or not the distinction of long-term versus  		acute care should even be made for persons with SMI. In the description of PACT  		presented earlier, the services provided ranged from medication support to  		assistance with daily living skills to housing assistance. Some persons would  		argue that the composition of the team and the medical nature of PACT services  		illustrate that these are acute services. However, when looking closely at the  		services provided, many of them seem to mirror services provided to elderly  		persons through long-term care programs (e.g. assistance with medication,  		grocery shopping, money management).</p>
<p>Since the line between acute and long-term care is blurry when looking  		at the services provided, perhaps examining the nature of the services (whether  		the services aim to support or improve functioning) would be beneficial. Acute  		services (which are often associated with hospital or outpatient services  		provided by a physician, psychologist, or other licensed provider) aim to  		improve the condition of the person whereas long-term care services are largely  		supportive. Some would argue that PACT services aim to improve performance and  		are not supportive in nature. This argument, however, may be incorrect. Many  		psychosocial rehabilitation programs such as PACT are highly supportive, as  		many persons with SMI served by these programs are <i>members for life</i>.  		What may cause some confusion is the term "rehabilitation". Rehabilitation lies  		somewhere between acute and long-term care, and often is closer to the "acute"  		side of the scale. While some of the services within PACT (and other similar  		programs) may provide rehabilitation through attempts to improve clients'  		independence, they are largely long-term and supportive in nature. This is not  		to say that all services under PACT should be provided under a long-term care  		program (e.g. assistance with obtaining entitlements, serving as a job coach)  		for an indefinite period of time; many advocates for persons with SMI would  		agree that this is not possible. But to make sincere efforts toward  		incorporating persons of all ages and all disabilities in a long-term program,  		some rethinking of what is traditional long-term care may be necessary.</p>
<p>Answers to the second issue, determining appropriate eligibility  		criteria, are also unclear. The conceptual needs for appropriate eligibility  		criteria are apparent (combining functional and social criteria), but  		sufficient data do not exist to analyze the impacts of using these criteria.  		The 1989 Mental Health Supplement to the Health Interview Survey (and the  		current Disability Supplement) does include some detail about social  		functioning, which may help provide a better picture of the types of needs  		persons with SMI have.<a href="#note18"><font>18</font></a> There is  		also the possibility of using state data, or data from specific programs such  		as PACT. Through informal discussions with various states and inquiries about  		the availability of data on the levels of functioning of clients and  		correlating service use when developing this report, many states responded that  		they did not have the data categorized by long-term services, but expressed  		interest in learning about information need by policymakers, as well as the  		willingness to listen to suggestions in modifying their databases.<a href="#note19"><font>19</font></a> Thus, efforts should be made at  		the federal policymaking level to work with states and organizations to  		identify methods for collecting data that will be useful to all parties.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, no clear methods for determining eligibility have  		been proposed that address the third conceptual issue, the cyclical nature of  		SMI. If the use of states' definitions and criteria continue, this may not be a  		major concern, as states may have the capability to quickly address needs. If  		larger long-term care reform is ever implemented, however, this need will again  		resurface. Mental health experts state that many eligibility criteria, as  		presently designed, require an individual to decompensate to receive benefits.  		In contrast, a system which is available and accessible when a person is  		functioning well would be a step toward preventing episodes of care that  		require longer and intensive provision of services. While this is an important  		goal, it leads to further problems.</p>
<p>For example, beyond establishing general criteria to enter the system,  		decisions must be made about establishing additional criteria to determine at  		what level of functioning a person will stop receiving benefits. Even though  		programs such as PACT often profess a member-for-life philosophy, such a  		philosophy is not feasible under a generic long-term care program. The next  		problem is coordinating services that are provided under a long-term care  		program with additional services, such as PACT or other psychosocial programs.  		For example, if a person is currently at a high level of functioning, how is  		the actual linkage made to those services that will be available when the  		individual decompensates? Will persons with SMI be assigned to a contact person  		with a program such as PACT who will contact them periodically to see how they  		are doing? One final problem to address is reassessment, whether or not there  		will be a new screening every time a client re-enters the long-term service  		system. Traditional long-term care services have been provided to a population  		(e.g. elderly) with needs that are not as dynamic. Dealing with persons who  		have a SMI and move in and out of the system will be difficult and  		expensive.</p>
<p>Addressing all of these issues around the cyclical nature of SMI,  		however, will be irrelevant if the criteria chosen for a long-term care  		services benefit do not capture persons with SMI who are the most disabled and  		have such cyclical needs. What may become more of an issue is not establishing  		criteria for reassessment, but determining criteria up-front that capture  		persons most disabled due to a mental disorder, persons with a SMI.</p>
<p>From the information presented in this report, do people with SMI do  		need long-term services? Their conditions are often chronic, persistent, and  		severe. However, they often do not need help with ADLs, such as assistance in  		toileting or getting in and out of bed. What they do need is some assistance in  		the IADLs, as well as constant encouragement and support in participating in  		activities such as socialization and work. What becomes crucial is (1)  		identifying the line between what is and is not a long-term service that will  		be paid for under a generic program and (2) identifying comparable services for  		persons with SMI relative to persons with physical disabilities or to elderly  		persons who are disabled.</p>
<p>This report suggests that there are some generic or at least comparable  		services between these disabled populations, even though guidelines for making  		distinctions remain unclear. Furthermore, the need for better linkages to  		different service sectors is apparent. Even though housing and employment are  		often considered different and separate services, they are also directly linked  		to the long-term success of individuals with SMI. If persons with schizophrenia  		cannot find a safe home or a supportive work environment, this may partially  		cause the deterioration of their condition to where they will cease taking care  		of themselves. Thus, while functioning problems may ultimately be evident in  		measures of IADL and even ADL limitations, they are a result of an  		unwillingness to look at the financial (i.e. housing and employment) and social  		needs of these individuals. However, long-term services will be expensive even  		with limited benefits and eligibility. To assume that a broad expansion can be  		made to help all individuals find a job under the funding of long-term care is  		unwise. But, if benefits such as housing cannot be provided under long-term  		services, perhaps improved linkages to these services can. This would be a step  		toward recognizing the goals of quality, consumer choice, and flexibility.</p>
<p>One final note: an assumption made in this report is that a future  		long-term care program will be modeled after the proposed HCBS benefit in the  		HSA. Such a generic program requires individuals to be categorized in two ways:  		having acute care needs or having long-term care needs. Looking at other models  		for delivering long-term care are possible as well, even though they were not  		discussed in this report. For example, such models might place individuals into  		three different categories: those with acute care needs, long-term care needs,  		and rehabilitative needs. Individuals with SMI may fall into this third  		category, and a program that provides rehabilitative services may be developed  		which better meets their needs and has more appropriate eligibility criteria  		than a program providing traditional long-term care services.</p>
