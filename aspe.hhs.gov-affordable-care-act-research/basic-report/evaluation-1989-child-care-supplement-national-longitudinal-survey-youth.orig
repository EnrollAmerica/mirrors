</dl><h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>This report summarizes the results of a special experiment in the  		collection (from 347 mothers) of detailed current and retrospective child care  		information carried out in conjunction with the 1989 (11th round) wave of the  		National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. It addresses a number of child care data  		quality and evaluation issues and provides some recommendations for subsequent  		data collection. Interested readers should have access to the 1989 Child Care  		Supplement in order to maximally be able to interpret the results of this  		report.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The 1989 (11th wave) round of the National Longitudinal Survey of Work  		Experience of Youth (NLSY) included a special child care supplement designed to  		obtain maternal reports of current and usual childcare, and retrospective care  		information about arrangements used since the last interview. The supplement  		was completed by 347 mothers in the sample who were all interviewed early in  		the survey round, primarily during the months of June and July. This special  		data collection was funded by the Department of Health and Human Services in  		order to evaluate several data quality issues.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Child care information in the NLSY (and in several other surveys) is  			 typically collected for the primary and secondary arrangement used by the  			 mother for her children. In this "pretest", information was gathered for every  			 child care arrangement lasting at least an hour during the survey week. The  			 intention here is to gauge the extent to which information about only the  			 primary and secondary care arrangement accurately reflects the totality of the  			 household child care arrangement for that time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1989 special child care supplement included a retrospective  			 child care section, which asked about every child care arrangement used by the  			 mother since the date of the last interview that lasted at least 10 hours in  			 any one week. The intent here was to evaluate, in a preliminary way, the extent  			 to which women are able to retrospectively reconstruct information about prior  			 child care arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The special child care supplement also contained a variety of  			 questions on other related child care topics of a behavioral and attitudinal  			 nature. The principal reason for including most of these questions was  			 essentially to test their face validity and general utility for helping explain  			 child care behavior; do they include a full range of apparently rational  			 responses and are respondents, for the most part, able to provide an answer? In  			 addition, are the precoded response possibilities, which are essential from a  			 cost perspective in any large scale survey, appropriate?</p>
</li>
</ol><h2><a name="sample" id="sample">SAMPLE AND DATA COLLECTION</a></h2>
<p>As indicated above, the child care supplement was completed by 347 women  		who were interviewed during the first month of the 1989 survey round. These  		mothers represented a full cross-section of the mothers in the survey. One  		major advantage of the approach was that over 100 interviewers were involved in  		this special data collection, with no interviewer collecting information from  		more than four respondents. Thus, the results are generalizable across a full  		range of interviewing situations. A potential disadvantage is that the limited  		interviews per interviewer may have caused some interviewers to be less  		polished in their administration of the supplement than they would have been  		had they each conducted a larger number of child care interviews. The reader is  		cautioned against using the specific statistics in this study to generalize to  		a full universe of mothers and children. These 347 cases constitute an  		unweighted sample of black, Hispanic and white mothers aged 24 to 32 who may  		not fully represent even this particular group--since they reflect interviews  		with only the first 347 of well over 3,000 mothers to be interviewed in the  		1989 survey round. Notwithstanding this caveat, the results probably reflect  		reasonably well the kinds of results, in terms of quality, which one could  		anticipate if the full cohort of mothers had been interviewed.</p>
<h2><a name="child" id="child">CHILD CARE ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE SURVEY WEEK</a></h2>
<p>Part I of the child care schedule details all of the survey week child  		care arrangements reported by the 347 mothers in this survey. Overall, about 85  		percent of the mothers indicated that the week preceding the interview was  		"typical" in terms of the child care they usually receive. About three quarters  		of the mothers indicated that someone helped them care for their children in  		the week prior to the interview. This level of actual current child care use is  		higher than is typically reported in most other studies of mothers with young  		children; indeed, the 75 percent reported using care is substantially above the  		rates of current care reported in prior N.L.S.Y. survey rounds. The fact that  		the data were collected during the summer months while many children are home  		from school does not account for this high use rate as most women (85 percent)  		reported last week as being a typical week. Indeed, only a total of 12 mothers  		indicated that they had to alter their usual arrangement because their children  		were home from school. More likely, as will be detailed below, the high rate of  		child care use probably reflects our probing for all arrangements lasting an  		hour or more, regardless of the respondent's usual activity.</p>
<p>The questions on current child care arrangements were principally  		designed to assess whether information about a woman's primary and secondary  		arrangement adequately describes all of the arrangements currently used. For 86  		percent of women, two or fewer arrangements represent all the arrangements they  		are currently using; no woman reported more than five survey week arrangements.  		<a href="#table1">Table1</a>, which synthesizes several dimensions of this  		survey week profile, shows that 88 percent of all survey week arrangements were  		either a primary or secondary arrangement, and that they accounted for about 91  		percent of all child care hours reported during the week. Thus, data collection  		limited to reports on two arrangements yields approximately 90 percent of the  		child care time that mothers typically utilize (or at least report about!). It  		is worth noting, however, that asking for information on three arrangements  		would increase the report of all arrangements and of all child care hours to  		about 97 percent. It is suggested that since the addition of third arrangements  		to data collection incorporates almost all the remaining arrangements, the  		option of including three rather than two arrangements in the NLSY child care  		data collection should be considered.</p>
<p>In general, the quality of the reporting with respect to current  		arrangements appears reasonable. Because this experiment occurred in the  		summer, and because the sample is essentially an unweighted group of mothers  		with an over-representation of minority and disadvantaged females, it is  		difficult to compare the patterning of arrangements in this study with other  		data. Nonetheless, it does appear that our intensive attempt to pick up all  		kinds of arrangements, however casual they may be, resulted in a greater  		tendency for mothers to report non-formal, sometimes non-paid arrangements.  		This probably reflects the emphasis in the introductory lead in statements  		encouraging the respondents to tell us about (1) any and all arrangements, (2)  		all arrangements lasting at least one hour, and (3) arrangements used for  		non-employment as well as employment activities. The distribution of types of  		arrangements includes larger proportions of care by relatives and smaller  		proportions of formal day care arrangements than typically found in other  		surveys--including earlier NLSY reports. In addition, relatively large  		proportions of mothers reported their spouse or partner as the caregiver. Also,  		the proportion of caregivers who are relatives tended to be even higher for  		secondary and tertiary arrangements and, correspondingly, very few of these  		arrangements were of a formal nature; and very few of these latter arrangements  		were in other than a private home.</p>
<p>Parallelling this apparent heavy representation of informal  		arrangements, only a minority of women reported that they paid for their  		arrangements. About 40 percent reported that they paid for their first  		arrangement and about 30 percent for second arrangements. This is well below  		what is, typically found in the NLSY or other surveys. In addition, the  		distribution of hours used for the primary arrangement is substantially  		different from what we have found in prior NLSY survey rounds.</p>
<p>In summary, our emphasis on encouraging women to report on any and all  		child care arrangements, formal or informal, <b>lasting for as short a time as  		one hour a week, regardless</b> of employment status, appears to have been  		relatively successful. In comparison with other available data, the mothers in  		our sample (1) were much more likely to have reported using child care, (2)  		were more likely to report non-formal arrangements, particularly relatives, (3)  		typically made child care arrangements for fewer hours per arrangement and (4)  		more often than not did not pay for the arrangement. Part of this pattern may  		reflect the summer season. More importantly, all of the above strongly suggest  		that question wordings which encourage respondents to report marginal  		arrangements appear to do so.</p>
<p>For arrangements that lasted ten hours a week or more, a variety of  		additional arrangement characteristics were collected (see Part I, questions 5I  		through 5N). This included information about the education and specialized  		child care training the caregivers may have received, the number of children  		cared for in the arrangement, the number of adult supervisors per group, and  		the date (month-year) the arrangement started.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> From the perspective of this particular study,  		the principal reason for including these questions was to gain insights into  		whether or not mothers, particularly those with multiple arrangements, are able  		to provide answers to the questions. (Whether or not the answers are indeed  		accurate would require independent corroboration, which to some extent is  		beyond the scope of our evaluation.) For the most part, the respondents were  		able to provide information about these child care characteristics. This was  		particularly true for the information about class size and number of child care  		personnel.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Mothers were  		somewhat less able to provide information on individual caregiver  		characteristics. Of the 234 women who reported a primary child care  		arrangement, 23 (10 percent) indicated that they did not know how much  		education the caregiver had. About 5 percent were unable to specify whether or  		not the caregiver had special early childhood training. The majority of the  		non-responses were reported for more formal arrangements--where the child was  		in a day or group care arrangement or was being watched by a non-relative age  		15 or over. The non-completion/don't know rates on these items were  		significantly lower for secondary and tertiary arrangements, undoubtedly  		reflecting the fact that these arrangements were more likely to involve family  		members--for whom this information would be known.</p>
<p>In contrast, virtually all the mothers provided information about class  		size and number of supervisors in the arrangement. About 85 percent of the  		children's primary arrangements was in groups of 7 or less and three quarters  		of the arrangements had only one caregiver. The relatively modest size of most  		arrangements makes the identification of the numbers of children and caregivers  		relatively easy and also probably quite accurate.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the two data items that required the greatest amount  		of recall and/or subjective evaluation appear to be of the poorest quality.  		While the start date for many, particularly major, arrangements may in most  		instances be easily recalled, there are situations where precision in  		recollection may be quite difficult. For example, if a particular arrangement  		is used intermittently over a lengthy time period, a respondent may be  		uncertain regarding which start date (or indeed, which termination date) to  		provide. A case in point would be a particular relative (e.g., grandmother) who  		is "available" for child care on a more or less continuing basis, but who is  		only used intermittently as needed. Unless a <b>precise</b> specification is  		used (e.g., "When was the very last time you used __________ for child care?")  		it is virtually impossible to obtain consistent (across respondents) usable  		information on arrangements of these types. In addition, our minimum cutoff on  		hours for obtaining dates for the beginning of current arrangements is ten  		hours. Given this rather modest hours threshold, plus the possibility that a  		respondent may be trying to reconstruct start dates for multiple arrangements,  		it is not surprising that recollection can in some instances be uncertain.</p>
<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> synthesizes the patterning of reported  		start dates for the 174 current primary arrangements lasting 10 or more hours a  		week. A usable start date could not be obtained for only three of these  		arrangements. The average (median) arrangement as of June 1989 was about nine  		months, meaning that about half the arrangements started after September 1988.  		An examination of the annual patterning of the beginning dates for these  		current arrangements indicates, not surprisingly, that the bulk of the current  		arrangements are of recent vintage. The reported monthly pattern is  		analytically somewhat more interesting. If one excludes arrangements that began  		in 1989, it is readily apparent that the most common months for beginning child  		care arrangements coincide with late summer-early fall, when children typically  		begin regular school programs. Indeed, for the pre-1989 period, almost half of  		all ongoing reported arrangements began either in August or September (the  		reasonableness of this patterning will be clarified further when the patterning  		of retrospective arrangements is considered). However, when one examines the  		pattern for those arrangements which began in 1989, it is apparent that there  		is a major tendency to report on very recent arrangements--those that began  		during the survey months. This undoubtedly reflects the reality that at any  		given point in time some substantial proportion of mothers are changing their  		child care arrangements and that this tendency may be particularly pronounced  		at the beginning of the summer, when school has just ended. Clearly,  		seasonality and duration of current arrangements can be significantly affected  		by the time of year the survey data are collected. This will be highlighted  		further in the section on retrospective data collection.</p>
<p>As a final note on the characteristics of current child care givers, it  		is useful to note that the only data item with a substantial number of  		responses falling in the "other" category is the question inquiring into the  		reason the respondent started using a particular child care arrangement. of the  		233 women who responded to this item, 77 or 33 percent provided an answer which  		did not fall into any of the available code categories. In addition, most of  		the coded responses either have only limited analytical utility or else could  		have been more appropriately diagnosed through the collection of parallel  		behavioral information; for example, 44 respondents gave as a reason "lost or  		stopped their previous caregiver," a response of limited analytical value.  		Eighty three gave as a reason the fact that they started work or training.  		Finally, it is important to note that the reason they started a current  		arrangement may have little to do with why they are currently using that  		arrangement. It is not clear how the responses to this question can be easily  		used in any analyses, unless they are more clearly specified for possible  		connection with other mother activities.</p>
<h2><a name="info" id="info">INFORMATION ON CURRENT CARE ARRANGEMENTS WHERE MORE THAN  		ONE CHILD IS REPORTED</a></h2>
<p>Part 2 of the child care supplement examined the extent to which  		within-household information about child care hours and payments were separable  		in households where more than one child utilized a particular caregiver. Our  		particular interest was in measuring the extent to which hours or costs are  		indeed separable between children and, additionally, the extent to which  		mothers indicate that they are unable to provide separate information, not  		because costs/hours were not separable, but because they were unable to  		quantify differences. Information was reported for 164 households which  		included two or more children. The data was collected for the two youngest  		children in the household.</p>
<p>On the positive side, it appears that respondents are frequently able to  		separate out child care costs which can be attributed to a particular child  		even if a particular provider is caring for more than one child in the  		household, regardless of whether both children are being watched the same or a  		different numbers of hours. On the downside, it is apparent that the  		interviewers had considerable difficulty in following the appropriate skip  		instructions for this section.</p>
<p>In only a very small number of cases were children not reported as being  		watched all hours by a particular caregiver if that caregiver was watching them  		at all; and this was true even with respect to secondary or tertiary  		arrangements. For example, 149 youngest children were reported as being watched  		by the primary caregiver and in 146 cases, the caregiver watched the child all  		the hours she worked. For the second youngest child, the same pattern held for  		129 and 121 cases respectively.</p>
<p>The interviewers had some difficulty in following the skip pattern  		instructions regarding the reporting on hours and costs; in a large number of  		cases they reported information even where it wasn't required. This is a minor  		problem, however. A bigger problem relates to the fact that many  		interviewers/mothers did not provide information on whether costs were separate  		or not (Column D in Child Care Chart BB). This probably reflects a flaw in the  		child care reporting form as many interviewers/mothers were continuing to  		follow the hours instructions in Column C--and were only reporting cost  		information if they had already reported that the hours information was  		separable; however, it is frequently possible to provide separate cost  		information even if both children were watched the same number of hours by the  		same person. However, for a substantial number of children, costs could be  		separated by child and, in these instances, most of the time separate costs  		were provided. Across all youngest child arrangements, there are 66 (of 231)  		instances where a mother indicated that separate costs could be identified, and  		in 59 of these cases, actual costs were provided.</p>
<p>Thus, in summary, the results suggest that mothers can frequently  		provide separate hours and/or cost information for each child. However, some of  		the skip patterns for questions of this type can be quite complex, considerable  		interviewer training is needed and clear questionnaire instructions provided.  		In this regard, it is useful to recall that while only experienced NLSY  		interviewers were selected for this pretest, they had only limited experience  		with this child care supplement. Their training included a brief self-study  		manual. Their actual field experience was limited to completing between one and  		four child care supplements. Thus, there was only limited opportunity to become  		thoroughly familiar with the questions and the skip patterns.</p>
<h2><a name="part3" id="part3">PART 3: INFORMATION ON ATTITUDES AND ALTERNATE  		ARRANGEMENTS</a></h2>
<p>This relatively heterogeneous (in terms of questions asked) section  		probes into a variety of issues relating to hypothetical child care interests  		and availability as well as the flexibility of current and recent arrangements  		for meeting unusual or emergency situations.</p>
<p>About four out of five mothers indicated that they would remain with  		their current child care arrangement even if <b>all</b> arrangements were  		available free of charge. Either this response pattern implies an  		extraordinarily high level of satisfaction or else individuals may not be  		sensitive to the full range of possibilities which are available. The question  		as worded has several limitations. First, a working woman's first preference  		might be to remain at home with her children (or have her spouse stay home) but  		it is not clear that this is an intended option given the wording of the  		question (even though 14 women did indicate this as a preference to their  		current arrangement). A woman's staying home implies a loss of wages, and it is  		not clear that "free" child care arrangements implies a wage subsidy to cover  		lost wages. Second, costs are certainly not the only child care constraint, as  		a woman might prefer an option which is not viable because of locational  		constraints (or other reasons). For these reasons, it is not clear how  		interpretable the responses to questions 7 and 7a really are. However, question  		8 (main reason for preferring other arrangement) does suggest that the  		principal reasons for preferring an alternate arrangement relate to the  		potential quality of the other arrangement, rather than other arrangement  		characteristics.</p>
<p>The responses to the questions asked of those not working are consistent  		with the notion that the dominant reason for non-employment for women at this  		life cycle stage is voluntary; 71 of 135 indicated that they prefer not to work  		while their children are young, and only a minority are interested in working  		at this time. (It is also useful to note that the large majority of respondents  		was able to provide a codable response to this question.)</p>
<p>In addition, the responses of most of the non-working women regarding  		what they view as reasonable costs are highly consistent with the actual costs  		being incurred by all the women who are currently paying for child care.  		Overall, on an hourly basis, the current child care users indicate a median  		wage of $1.50 an hour, with 40 percent paying $1.25 an hour or less and 40  		percent $2.00 or more. In comparison, the 131 non-working women who responded  		to the question on "reasonable costs for a full time week" of child care  		(question 12), gave a median response of $50, with 40 percent indicating $40 or  		less and 30 percent $55 or more. The modal response was $50. Thus, while this  		cost distribution was slightly below the actual costs reported as being  		incurred by those using care, the hypothetical responses were not substantially  		different from the reported reality.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to the non-workers, it is useful to note that the  		large majority specify a relative as the caregiver when they go out for reasons  		such as entertainment or shopping. There is little tendency to seek formal  		arrangements. However, there is no hesitancy regarding being able to specify  		the caregiver which is used for non-employment reasons.</p>
<p>Issues linked with child illness and employment are, not surprisingly,  		of some importance in evaluating child care/employment considerations for women  		at this life cycle stage.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> Fully one quarter (52 women) of the employed  		women had a child who was ill within the past month and 18 of these 52 women  		lost time from work because of this illness. Thus about two thirds of these  		employed women were able to make arrangements which permitted them to go to  		work while their child was ill. Of those who lost time from work, most missed  		two or fewer days and about one third had to take leave without pay. The  		important issue here is not the precise quantification of the patterns reported  		by the experimental sample but rather that (1) the phenomenon, which is of some  		importance, is analytically non-trivial and (2) women appear to be able to  		effectively report on this issue.</p>
<p>In contrast, only very small numbers report other difficulties with  		their child care arrangements over the last month. Only 5 of 213 reported  		difficulty with their regular arrangement and only 10 reported that they were  		late to work or had to leave early. Indeed, only 18 of 216 (about 8 percent)  		indicated that <b>over the last 12 months</b>, "problems with the <b>cost,  		availability</b> or <b>quality</b> of child care influenced their employment  		<b>in any way</b>." This very modest percentage reporting problems would appear  		to run counter to some popular perceptions. On the other hand, it <b>is</b>  		consistent with the earlier stated result that few of the women would change  		arrangements even if costs were not a constraint. Thus, either these results  		reflect reality or else there is something in the wording of the questions  		which affects the woman's frame of reference in such a way as to cause women to  		not consider a full range of options. Interviewer notes indicate that while  		some mothers did not actually miss work, they did occasionally take children to  		work when their caregiver was unavailable.</p>
<p>The final child care dimension considered in Part 3 of the interview  		schedule examined the issue of potential availability of relatives for child  		care assistance for those women who were currently employed as of the survey  		date. Somewhat surprisingly, the vast majority--190 of 213 working women  		indicated that they had a relative living in the vicinity. The respondents were  		in all instances able to identify the work status of these relatives. Only a  		modest percentage of these relatives, about 25 percent, are currently helping  		with child care on a regularly scheduled basis. The high percentage of mothers  		who have a relative (blood or through marriage) nearby may partly reflect the  		fact that the sample is not fully representative of all mothers; that it  		disproportionally includes women who married at younger ages and have limited  		education. It is probable that these younger marrieds are less likely than  		other women to live far away from their familial  		neighborhood/environment.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As a general comment regarding all of the attitudinal and behavioral  		items in this section of the questionnaire, there is no evidence of  		unwillingness or inability to answer questions. The cost-related information  		was provided on request, although, of course, its accuracy (regarding actual  		amounts) can be questioned. Generally speaking, the items on reasons for not  		working or child care preference were answered fairly readily and, as  		importantly, the pre-determined code categories were generally appropriate; the  		number of responses which needed to be coded into the "other" category was  		generally modest.</p>
<h2><a name="part4" id="part4">PART 4: INFORMATION ON "USUAL CHILD CARE" FOR SCHOOL  		AGE CHILDREN</a></h2>
<p>Because this pretest took place during the months of June and July, when  		most school age children are out of school for the summer, the pretest included  		a few essentially retrospective questions probing into the usual arrangements  		made for school age children after school. The bulk of the school age children  		in this study are between the ages of five and nine, and thus either in  		kindergarten or in the earlier elementary school grades. Of the 222 youngest  		school children, 196 were between the ages of five and nine; 102 of their next  		oldest siblings ("second youngest school age child") were also considered in  		this evaluation.</p>
<p>As may be noted from <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, the vast majority of  		the school age children follow a traditional post-school child care mode--they  		apparently go home and are supervised in the home by someone who is age 14 or  		older. Of those who don't go home, the largest proportion are in some other  		fairly traditional child care arrangement--cared for by other relatives, a baby  		sitter, or in a child care center. Very few mothers reported latch key  		arrangements. There are also very few reports of multiple arrangements.  		Apparently, the vast majority of the children are in the same arrangement every  		day. It is possible that if the children in this study were somewhat older,  		more latch key and other non-traditional arrangements would have been  		reported.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> It is also  		possible that some parents might have been reluctant to report about latch key  		or other "socially less acceptable" arrangements. What the data suggest is that  		analysis of the incidence and consequences of latch key arrangements will in  		all likelihood not be feasible unless one has a very large sample of children,  		given the rarity of reporting of this arrangement.</p>
<h2><a name="evaluation" id="evaluation">EVALUATION OF THE RETROSPECTIVE REPORTS ON CHILD  		CARE ARRANGEMENTS ONGOING OVER THE PAST YEAR</a></h2>
<p>The results from the retrospective data collection in the child care  		supplement clarified a variety of issues regarding the efficacy of collecting  		child care information in a quasi-event history format. Some useful data were  		collected, and some significant problems are apparent. The problems reflect  		limitations which are inherent to retrospective data collection, imprecision in  		some of the child care concepts and oversights (inconsistencies) in how we  		defined current and retrospective arrangements.</p>
<p>The major conceptual problem relates to how one defines an  		arrangement--either current or retrospective. It is apparent from both the  		coded responses as well as marginal notes in the interview schedules, that the  		concept of a continuous child care arrangement is extremely ambiguous. At one  		extreme, a mother may use a particular arrangement continuously, for a large  		number of hours each week with no intermittent interruptions. At the other  		extreme, one has situations where a "caregiver" is essentially continuously "on  		call," but only used intermittently. A grandmother living nearby (or even the  		other parent) may fall into this category--as might a more formal caregiving  		arrangement. This poses a major problem when one attempts to obtain "beginning"  		and "ending" dates for a particular arrangement. With regard to a current  		arrangement, one must consciously make a judgement as to what starting date one  		wishes. Does one want the date that caregiver was <b>first</b> utilized by the  		respondent? Alternatively, one could focus on the <b>last</b> date that the  		caregiver began assisting the respondent. Or, perhaps most reasonably, one can  		focus on a start date that allows the caregiver to have had modest  		interruptions (2 weeks?). This last option may be most appropriate in many  		instances, but perhaps not always easy to quantify, because of recall  		problems.</p>
<p>From an event history perspective, this issue becomes inherently even  		more complex if one chooses to consider several child care episodes with the  		same child care personnel as distinct arrangements. For example, a respondent  		may have used the same arrangement several times over the past year, with  		distinct time breaks between use. The gaps between use may or may not have been  		filled by other arrangements.</p>
<p>Somewhat parallel to this problem of specifying beginning and ending  		dates for arrangements, is the problem of defining hours for arrangements. It  		is likely that respondents are better able to recall arrangements which not  		only lasted longer, but which were used for a greater number of hours within a  		particular time span. In the extreme case, an arrangement that lasted 40 hours  		in a given week will be recalled more readily than a three hour babysitting  		arrangement. (In addition, arguably, a paid arrangement will perhaps be more  		readily recalled than a non-paying arrangement, unless specific probes for  		non-paying arrangements are utilized). Thus, in a retrospective context, unless  		one is probing for every hour of care utilized in a time frame, one needs to  		specify an hour minimum for a given arrangement. This is inherently complex,  		particularly if a respondent used the same arrangement for more than one  		distinct period during the year, and used that arrangement for a different  		number of hours each time.</p>
<p>In our case, we limited retrospective data collection to arrangements  		which lasted at least ten hours in any one week during the year. In addition,  		we failed to clarify whether or not using the same caregiver in two distinctly  		different arrangements constituted one or multiple arrangements. It is apparent  		from our results that many respondents were uncertain as to whether or not to  		count the same arrangement more than once, even if that arrangement was used  		intermittently over the course of the year with substantial time breaks between  		usage. In the extreme case, a respondent who may have use a particular  		arrangement off and on for a particular child over a period of many years may  		have given the child's birth as the start date, and also indicate that she is  		still (on occasion) using that arrangement. Because of these serious  		constraints, the data we have collected do not lend themselves to developing an  		annual week by week or month by month child care use profile; apparent "stop"  		and "start" dates encompass substantial time periods during which the  		arrangement may not have been used.</p>
<p>One other problem, which reflected an oversight on our part in the  		construction of the interview schedule, intensified the difficulty of defining  		the duration of arrangements. Data were collected for all <b>current</b>  		arrangements lasting at least <b>one hour</b> in the past week. However, the  		retrospective data collection was limited to arrangements lasting at least ten  		hours in <b>any</b> week. This made it difficult to attempt to link the current  		and retrospective arrangements. For example, a mother might have reported on a  		survey week arrangement which lasted four hours. She then reported once again  		on that same arrangement in the retrospective child care history, because there  		was some other time during the year when she used that arrangement at least ten  		hours. We had not allowed for this option in the interview schedule, so it  		created confusion for some interviewers and respondents. The introductory  		paragraph in the retrospective section asked the respondent "not counting your  		current arrangement(s), have you used any <b>other</b> child care for at least  		10 hours in any one week since the last interviews" Because of this oversight,  		quite a bit of hand editing was necessary in order to eliminate arrangement  		duplication. Future data collection could minimize problems of this type by  		attempting to use parallel definitions of child care for current and  		retrospective arrangements and, most importantly, assigning I.D.s to each  		arrangement. The latter procedure, if properly done, would permit researchers  		to program the child care information in whatever way is deemed most  		appropriate. Using IDs would allow one to remove duplication, if one desires,  		to compare arrangements over the full retrospective time period, defining the  		same arrangements which are temporally dispersed as the same or different  		arrangements), depending on one's inclination.</p>
<p>One final issue regarding the time frame of the retrospective section  		warrants mention. The retrospective section of the questionnaire collected  		information on arrangements used since the <b>date of last interview</b>. From  		a post-hoc perspective, this was ill advised, for methodological and perhaps  		substantive reasons. A preferable option would have been to collect the  		retrospective child care information for a full twelve or thirteen month period  		for all respondents, beginning the event history on June or July 1, 1988. Using  		a last interview starting point resulted in a gradual diminution of the level  		of child care use as one moved backwards into the summer months of 1988. We  		could certainly partially resolve this issue by translating our <b>levels</b>  		of start and stop dates into proportions. However, this would not resolve the  		problem of selective bias due to certain kinds of women (e.g., employed? home  		at certain hours) perhaps being interviewed earlier or later in the summer.  		This, of course, is only an issue in a continuing longitudinal survey such as  		this, where there are major reasons for linking with a prior survey date (e.g.,  		to link child care histories with employment history).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above issues, the retrospective child care data  		collection provided some useful analytical results--beyond the insights already  		suggested. Substantive differences (and similarities) between current and  		retrospective child care arrangements are highlighted in this section, as they  		help clarify biases inherent in the essentially different methods used to  		collect current and retrospective data.</p>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> summarizes the information on current and  		retrospective child care arrangements. It includes distributions of the number  		of arrangements currently used by mothers and the number of additional  		arrangements used during the preceding year. Most of the comparisons of current  		and retrospective patterns will essentially contrast distributions limited to  		current arrangements lasting ten hours or more during the survey week with  		distributions for retrospective arrangements which were used for ten hours in  		at least one week during the year. Thus, the comparisons are only approximately  		comparable. When arrangements of less than ten hours are excluded from the  		current arrangement distribution, only about 56 percent of women report having  		any current childcare assistance compared with about 75 percent when all  		arrangements are included. Thus, eliminating arrangements of fewer hours makes  		the percentage using care much more comparable with current usage statistics  		reported in other data sets, including earlier NLSY rounds. The largest  		majority (about 73 percent) of mothers using arrangements lasting ten hours or  		more have only one such arrangement and about 94 percent of these mothers using  		care report only one or two such arrangements.</p>
<p>Excluding all current arrangements, only about 31 percent of all the  		mothers reported on an additional arrangement over the preceding year which  		lasted at least ten hours in any one week. Thus, if these data are at all  		reliable, it may be concluded that the bulk of the more extensive arrangements  		which a woman has during a given year can at least be identified as ongoing as  		of one point in time. In addition, the intensity of involvement with the  		retrospective arrangements is somewhat less certain than is the involvement  		with the current arrangements, reflecting the ambiguity regarding the hours the  		retrospective arrangements are/were being used. In this regard, it is important  		to note that of the 109 women who report at least one retrospective  		arrangement, 17 (16 percent) indicate that that arrangement is still ongoing as  		of the survey week, but that they are not using that arrangement for <b>any</b>  		hours at this time. This highlights the issue alluded to above--that there are  		a significant number of child care users who define the duration of  		arrangements (including beginning and ending dates) in terms of ready  		availability of the caregiver, not just in terms of current usage. These  		caregivers, who frequently, although not always, are family members, pose a  		significant definitional problem in defining meaningful child care event  		histories.</p>
<p><a href="#table5A">Table 5A</a> and <a href="#table5B">Table 5B</a>  		describe the temporal patterning of current and retrospective child care  		arrangements, both in terms of seasonality and longevity. A comparison of the  		starting dates for the ongoing as well as retrospective child care arrangements  		suggests some important similarities as well as differences. With regard to the  		monthly patterning of start dates, child care arrangement "starts" in 1989 are  		separated from the results for preceding years because the interviews were all  		carried out in June and July. Most of the current (ongoing) arrangements which  		started in 1989 began in May or June, many within just a few weeks of the  		survey date. This trend partly reflects the fact that some parents are  		beginning summer arrangements for school and preschool age children to cover  		the out-of-school summer months. Part of the high reporting level for May and  		June also probably reflects an above average tendency to recall recent events.  		When one examines the pre-1989 distribution of starting dates for current  		arrangements (focusing on the January through June distribution for all  		preceding years), it is apparent that May and June are above average months for  		beginning child care arrangements. This same pattern also exists when one  		examines retrospective arrangements--those which for the most part have been  		terminated prior to the 1989 survey week.</p>
<p>The start dates for pre-1989 current arrangements as well as for  		retrospective arrangements both show a pronounced pattern of arrangements  		beginning in August and September, coinciding with the beginning of the school  		year. Thus, the patterning of the starting dates for both current and (recent)  		past arrangements both appear to have a high face validity in that the most  		prevalent beginning dates coincide with the months when parents are most likely  		to be making new arrangements.</p>
<p>The patterning of "ending dates" for retrospective arrangements,  		described in <a href="#table6">Table 6</a>, is harder to interpret. Part of the  		reason for the very low percentage of arrangements ending in the early calendar  		year months is that these months occurred prior to the preceding interview date  		for some Respondents thus their arrangement ending date would not have fallen  		within the time reference period being investigated. The high proportion of  		arrangement ending dates in the Spring of 1989 undoubtedly is closely linked  		with the ending of the school year, a transition point for many child care  		arrangements.</p>
<p>Focusing briefly on the annual patterns suggested by <a href="#table5A">Table 5A</a>, <a href="#table5B">Table 5B</a>, and  		<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>, it appears that the arrangements which  		respondents report as ongoing for ten hours or more as of the survey date are  		indeed more likely to typify the more permanent arrangements a respondent uses  		than do the other retrospective arrangements reported. It is of some interest  		to note that almost 40 percent of all current arrangements (used for at least  		ten hours in the survey week) are reported as having started in 1987 or  		earlier, compared with 15 percent for the retrospective arrangements. This  		probably reflects the fact that arrangements which are considered more  		satisfactory are probably more likely to be sustained for a longer time  		period--up to the present time. In addition, one's recollection about the  		history of recent or ongoing activities is probably better than recall about  		historic events. Third, many parents probably sustain a major arrangement on as  		continuing a basis as possible and then supplement that arrangement as needed.  		Analytically, this patterning has at least two implications. One needs to be  		cautious about assuming that lengthy ongoing arrangements are being used  		continuously, that from an event history perspective, one can assume a  		continuity of use between stop and start dates. This will be clarified with  		some of the subsequent tabular materials.</p>
<p>As importantly, <b>one must be cautious when interpreting quality  		dimensions of child care when examining a cross-section</b>. If one can  		(reasonably) assume that the current arrangements, which on average can be  		documented as much longer lasting than terminated (retrospective) arrangements,  		are more satisfactory to the respondent, <b>making judgments about satisfaction  		or quality from the cross-section must be done cautiously</b>. The less  		satisfactory arrangements are more likely to have been discontinued and thus  		less likely to appear at any one point in time!</p>
<p>Similarly, if one is focusing on the length of child care arrangements  		and how these arrangements are linked with other family characteristics, one  		needs to be doubly cautious, as both issues of seasonality and continuity are  		important. These phenomena are highlighted in <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>,  		which describes the duration, in months, of current (ongoing) as well as  		retrospective child care arrangements. It may be noted that a substantial  		proportion of current arrangements are very recent, coinciding with the fact  		that the interviews occurred in late spring-early summer when respondents are  		beginning summer arrangements. It should also be noted that a secondary  		"heaping" occurs at nine and ten months, coinciding with the beginning of the  		preceding school year. Thus, at any point in time the "shape" (and probably the  		nature) of the duration distribution will be extremely sensitive to the time of  		year the interviews are completed. For example, interviewing carried out in  		September or October will result in a duration distribution which includes a  		particularly large proportion of new arrangements (and probably a secondary  		heaping at 11 and 12 months). It may also be noted that the duration  		distribution of retrospective arrangements has a somewhat similar shape,  		suggesting that even most arrangements which have been terminated are driven by  		the same seasonal factors. However, in this case, the disproportionate heaping  		of durations up to three months is consistent with the fact that respondents  		are more likely to recollect retrospective shorter term arrangements from  		recent time periods. In addition, it is important to highlight one other fact  		about the retrospective durations which is not immediately evident from  		<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>; almost 50 percent of the retrospective  		arrangements of more than 12 months duration fall in the category of "ongoing"  		arrangements (see note to <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>), which are <b>not</b>  		being utilized for any hours in the survey week but which the respondent  		undoubtedly considers as available if needed. Thus, not only are retrospective  		arrangements less likely to be long term (as described by the distributions in  		<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>), but those which are long term are probably much  		more likely to represent non-continuous arrangements than are comparable long  		term current arrangements.</p>
<p><a href="#table8">Table 8</a> synthesizes information about the types of  		arrangements which predominate in ongoing and retrospective child care  		situations. The results summarized in this table demonstrate (1) the  		difficulties inherent in gathering comprehensive data for retrospective periods  		and (2) potential analytical biases which may exist if one treats  		cross-sectional data as typical of all child care arrangements.</p>
<p>The first point to note from <a href="#table8">Table 8</a> is that the  		nature of the current arrangements is, not surprisingly, sensitive to the  		number of hours that the child care arrangement is used; arrangements lasting  		more hours are less likely to be care by the "other parent" or a relative, and  		(not reported in table) more likely to be paid arrangements. Thus, the more one  		probes for casual, shorter term arrangements (as we have done in this pretest),  		the more accurately the mix of arrangements portrays the reality of current  		child care. Because of our probes for arrangements (1) lasting at least one  		hour during the week, (2) not necessarily linked with employment, and (3) of a  		less formal nature, it appears that this experiment picked up a fuller  		representation of <b>ongoing</b> child care arrangements than most other  		surveys have accomplished, as well as a larger proportion of all women using  		child care. (As a cautionary note, part of this differing level and mix also  		undoubtedly represents a seasonality factor, that the respondents were mostly  		interviewed in June; however, one of our comparisons is with 1986 NLSY child  		care data, which also were disproportionately collected in the summer.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the retrospective data on child care which was limited to  		arrangements lasting at least ten hours in any one week provided very different  		results, more consistent with what has traditionally been available.  		Respondents who reported retrospective arrangements were much less likely to  		list parents and grandparents, and much more likely to mention non-relatives  		and, to some extent, daycare centers. In short, truncating the data collection  		on the basis of hours shifts the child care distribution rather dramatically  		away from informal and towards formal (paid) arrangements. From the perspective  		of data collection, it is clear that the representation of child care  		arrangements will be very different for current and retrospective periods  		unless one maximally strives to use comparable definitions of child care for  		both, a difficult task at best. Analytically, the implications are of equal  		importance. Any examination of either determinants or consequences of child  		care in a longitudinal context will be difficult to interpret unless (1)  		standardized definitions are used and, more importantly, (2) these definitions  		are as comprehensive as possible. For example, evaluating the child development  		consequences of child care will probably be very sensitive to the extensiveness  		of the arrangements included in the child care definition. Thus, child care use  		defined in a more limited manner--including comprehensively <b>only</b>  		extensive arrangements of a more formal nature and shortchanging shorter term  		(but perhaps diverse) arrangements which are less formal--may have very  		differing implications for measuring impacts on childrens' development. Indeed,  		one might argue that, from a <b>child development analytical perspective</b>,  		it may be counter-productive to collect only selective, longer term child care  		input information. Analysis based on this limited data could well produce  		erroneous results leading to inappropriate policy conclusions.</p>
<p>A final analytical comment relates to the quality and utility of  		retrospective attitudinal child care information which can be collected in a  		large scale survey of this type. <a href="#table9">Table 9</a> synthesizes the  		reasons which respondents gave for beginning their current and retrospective  		child care arrangements. Nor surprisingly, the dominant reason given for  		starting an arrangement was employment related--a job was started, or a  		previous caregiver had ceased to provide assistance. In addition, relatively  		substantial proportions of women gave idiosyncratic reasons ("other") which  		could not readily be coded in any coherent manner. It is suggested that in a  		longitudinal survey which attempts to collect event history information on a  		variety of employment, family, and education characteristics, retrospective,  		even relatively "hard" attitudinal information of this kind is relatively  		worthless. More insightful information on the linkage between employment and  		child care can be gained by comparing behavioral event-history information on  		employment or schooling and child care, comparing beginning and ending points  		of different events, <b>if this information is carefully collected</b>. The  		fact that an arrangement was started because a prior one had ended is also not  		particularly useful analytically unless one also has comprehensive information  		about the reason for the change in arrangements, something which may not be  		easy to determine retrospectively. Analytically, in a longitudinal context, a  		more fruitful approach is to gather comprehensive <b>objective</b> and  		<b>subjective</b> information about current arrangements, and then wait and see  		what the implications are for subsequent change or continuity.</p>
<p>As a final note on the apparent validity of the retrospective child care  		information, it is useful to note that there is virtually no evidence of  		respondents being unable to recall the characteristics of retrospective  		arrangements. While we have no external cross-checks on the quality of the  		reports, it should be noted that virtually all of the mothers provided  		responses to the questions on the number of hours per week retrospective  		arrangements lasted, the number of children cared for in the arrangement, the  		child to adult ratio, educational attainment of the caregivers, costs of the  		arrangement, as well as information about early childhood training received by  		the caregiver. It is particularly interesting to note that a "yes" or "no"  		answer (26 yes and 82 no) regarding early childhood training was given by all  		except one parent for the primary retrospective arrangement reported. whether  		the "nos" in some instances really represent "don't knows" cannot be answered.  		In retrospect, the information on the number of children in an arrangement  		number of caregivers, and characteristics of caregivers were probably  		relatively easy to recall because the vast majority of children were in  		arrangements which included three or fewer children and either one or two  		adults.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</a></h2>
<h3>1. Current Child Care Use</h3>
<p>Overall, about three quarters of the mothers had a child care  		arrangement lasting at least one hour during the survey week, a proportion  		considerably higher than has typically been reported in other studies. Eighty  		six percent of the care users reported that they used one or two arrangements  		during the week. Ninety seven percent of care users report no more than three  		arrangements in the survey week.</p>
<p>The survey week arrangements reported on appear to include a larger  		proportion of informal (e.g., care by spouse and other relatives) and a smaller  		proportion of formal arrangements than has typically been found in other  		studies. Parallelling this result, it was found that a substantial majority of  		women do not make any cash payments for their current arrangements.</p>
<p>It is likely that the apparently more comprehensive nature of current  		child care reported in this experiment reflects at least in part our emphasis  		on encouraging women to report on any and all child care arrangements, formal  		or informal, lasting for as short a time as one hour a week, regardless of the  		employment orientation of the mother. In addition, we put no constraint on the  		number of arrangements which a mother could report on. In this regard, we have  		strong empirical evidence that allowing for three arrangements results in  		almost complete coverage.</p>
<p>Based on the above, <b>we recommend (for the NLSY or other comparable  		surveys) that a comprehensive introductory paragraph (similar to that used in  		this study) establishing the broad scope of the intended data collection be  		utilized and that data be collected on primary, secondary, and tertiary  		arrangements</b>. Our evidence suggests that this should provide reasonably  		comprehensive coverage regarding all ongoing child care activities.</p>
<p>The relatively low proportion reporting that their arrangements are paid  		for suggests the likelihood that other arrangements of a quid pro quo nature  		may be operative for some significant proportion of all arrangements. This  		could include the provision of exchange services or other benefits (such as  		food and/or housing) to caregivers. Information on arrangements of this kind  		could greatly enhance analyses focusing on either social-psychological or  		economic exchanges for child care services. For this reason, <b>it is  		recommended that subsequent data collection consider the inclusion of at least  		a preliminary attempt to measure such less easily quantifiable costs of child  		care arrangements</b>.</p>
<p>Several sections of the child care interview schedule asked a variety of  		questions about the characteristics of current (and retrospective)  		arrangements, including questions on costs, hours, caregiver education, the  		number of children included in the arrangement, and the number of caregivers in  		the arrangement. In addition, where a caregiver was used for more than one  		child, questions were asked regarding the hours each (of the two youngest  		children) was watched and the costs associated with watching each child. With  		only minor exceptions (e.g., the education/specialized training of caregivers  		in formal arrangements), the respondents were able to provide what appears to  		be reasonable responses. In addition, the results support the notion that  		mothers frequently are able to provide separate cost estimates where more than  		one child is being watched in a particular arrangement.</p>
<p>Similarly, the respondents were able to provide important and apparently  		reasonable information about the extent to which they needed to absent  		themselves from work to meet child health-related exigencies in the home or to  		cover for a "snafu" in their child care arrangement. The results suggest  		sufficient response variability to warrant collecting this information on a  		larger scale.</p>
<p>The results of the attitudinal data collection, particularly regarding  		hypothetical child care needs, are somewhat more ambiguous. The respondents  		expressed a high level of satisfaction regarding their current child care  		arrangements and only a small proportion expressed a willingness to change  		arrangements even if their ideal were available "cost-free." It may be that  		this high level of satisfaction reflects the possibility that the questions  		were not sufficiently broad. For example, a woman might, in an ideal situation,  		prefer to remain home with her children, but the foregone cost-giving up real  		wages--may have been viewed as beyond the scope of the question. It is  		suggested that the question, as worded, perhaps has limited analytical  		potential, and that future data collection attempts in this area consider  		several broader concepts; in particular, specifically, what would it take to  		get a mother to stay home with her child, if this is truly the option she would  		prefer?</p>
<h3>2. Retrospectively Reported Child Care Arrangements</h3>
<p>In general, the seasonal patterning of current and retrospectively  		reported arrangements appear reasonable, and are comparable to each other; the  		beginning and end of the summer show above average tendencies to begin new  		child care arrangements. Thus, analysis of child care duration, and its linkage  		with other explanatory factors, needs to be sensitive to the month the data are  		collected. Data collection during the summer or early fall results in child  		care duration characteristics which will include a high proportion of short  		term arrangements.</p>
<p>It appears that reports on retrospective arrangements tend to  		under-report the more casual, shorter term arrangements and overemphasize more  		formal arrangements. This tendency, of course, at least partly reflects our  		definitional constraints on the question on retrospective child care--that the  		arrangement must have been used for at least ten hours in a week at some time  		during the year. The retrospective reports also appear to include a substantial  		number of arrangements of an intermittent nature, used now and then but not on  		a continuing basis. Indeed, the longer term retrospectively reported  		arrangements are more likely to fall in this category. In general, however,  		retrospective arrangements are less likely to be long term, suggesting a  		"selection bias;" preferred arrangements are more likely to be continued into  		the present than less preferred arrangements. <b>This suggests the potential  		for significant analytical bias if one uses current (ongoing) child care  		arrangements as proxies for all arrangements when examining child care quality  		issues</b>.</p>
<p>From an event history perspective, it is unclear whether the  		retrospective event history data collected in this experiment is of sufficient  		quality to have significant analytical value. Within the context of a survey  		such as the NLSY, to be of significant analytical value, the child care event  		dating must be of sufficient precision so that it can be matched with parallel  		event history information on, for example, employment, education, and family  		experiences. For the reasons described in this report, it is not likely that  		the retrospective child care data parallel in quality the other event history  		data.</p>
<p><b>It is likely that retrospective information of sufficient quality  		could be collected, but the time and monetary costs of doing so should not be  		underestimated</b>. The data collection would require the following; beginning  		at a fixed historical point (preferably matched with other events, using  		appropriate calendars), one would need to move forward week by week (or at  		least month by month) collecting the following information: (1) child care  		use/non use for each week/month interval including the precise identification  		of the arrangement, the number of hours per unit time the arrangement is being  		utilized, as well as any complementary information desired. <b>Whatever  		definitions are used for the collection of retrospective child care information  		should parallel the definitions used in collecting current child care data</b>.  		In addition, <b>each unique arrangement should have an identification  		number</b>. If an arrangement is repeated at a different point in time, it  		could then be readily identified and linked. At the point where any arrangement  		is terminated for any length of time, an ending date would be obtained. At the  		point where any arrangement is initiated or re-initiated, a beginning date  		would be obtained. Ideally, the collection of these event history data would  		parallel equally precise data collection on other activities which tend to be  		linked with child care use--such as employment, education, or family events.  		The instructions relating to this child care data collection should ask  		respondents to describe (1) child care used for as little as one hour a week,  		and (2) arrangements of a formal or informal nature, including any and all care  		by relatives. The over-riding emphasis must be on <b>actual hours</b> that a  		child care arrangement was <b>used</b> in a given period, <b>not</b> simply  		access to a possible arrangement. It should be apparent that careful data  		collection of this type can be time consuming and expensive. However, any  		lesser efforts may well result in the collection of event history data which,  		on the surface, appears usable, but in reality is severely limiting from a  		longitudinal analytical perspective.</p>
<p><b>From the perspective of examining the consequences of child care for  		subsequent child development, the definitions of child care used may be of  		critical importance</b>. Child care use defined in a limited manner, focusing  		on longer term, more formal arrangements may affect in major ways analytical  		results in this area of research; the results may be of value, but  		generalizations regarding the costs or benefits of child care will perhaps be  		less feasible and will require more extensive qualifications.</p>
