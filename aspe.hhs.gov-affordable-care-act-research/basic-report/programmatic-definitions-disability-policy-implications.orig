</dl><h2><a name="background" id="background">I. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p>This paper looks at programmatic definitions of disability for Federal  		disability programs by: (1) reviewing and examining major programmatic  		definitions of disability; (2) describing complex eligibility processes by  		using the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program as an example;  		and, (3) discussing how some proposed changes in program definitions might  		affect future policy.</p>
<p>Massive amounts are spent on Federal programs targeted on persons with  		disabilities. In FY 1989 $85 billion or 8 percent of all Federal outlays was  		spent on disability programs targeted <b>JUST</b> on nonelderly persons with  		disabilities. Admission onto Federal programs is determined by how disability  		is defined programmatically and which specific eligibility criteria are  		employed.</p>
<p>Disability is notoriously hard to define and definitions vary widely.  		The many Federal disability programs who is eligible to receive benefits, who  		is not, who could in the future, and who would be if program modifications were  		made. Differences in programmatic definitions result in wide variations in the  		number and characteristics of persons eligible to receive benefits and huge  		difference in how much programs cost.</p>
<p>Measures from population-based surveys often serve as the basis for  		estimates of participation in Federal programs. These measures are perhaps  		hardest to derive for disability programs, because disability. For example, the  		purpose of the SSDI program is to provide monthly cash assistance to disabled  		workers under 65 and (in some cases) to dependents. In 1984, 3.1 million  		persons received SSDI benefits. According to the 1984 SIPP, measures of  		functional disability range from 21.7 million (those with any functional  		disability) to 3.2 million (those with an ADL/IADL limitation).</p>
<p>Finally, programmatic definitions are dynamic, with changes occurring  		due to amendments to the law, new regulations, and court decisions which may  		either modify programmatic definitions or eligibility criteria.</p>
<h2><a name="research" id="research">II. OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH AND PROGRAMMATIC  		DEFINITIONS OF DISABILITY</a></h2>
<p>Research definitions of disability are also hard to define, because so  		many aspects of human behavior (medical, social, and cultural) are involved.  		Definitions again depend on context. Disability is defined and measured for a  		variety of research purposes including medical, sociological, epidemiological,  		rehabilitative, vocational, and educational studies.</p>
<p>Two major conceptual frameworks of disability are widely accepted (and  		criticized) within the research community. These are the International  		Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) from the  		World Health Organization (WHO) and the Nagi model (developed by Saad Nagi of  		Ohio State University). Each model has four distinct concepts or stages. These  		are disease, impairment, disability, and handicap for the ICIDH model and  		pathology, impairment, functional limitation, and disability for the Nagi model  		(IOM). Problems in defining disability are exacerbated, because these concepts  		or stages (i.e. disability and handicap) are often interchanged.</p>
<p>Functional definitions of disability are commonly accepted measures of  		disability for the entire population. Broad overall functions fall into  		socially defined categories, which vary by age, gender, class, and culture.  		These have been defined by the National Health Interview Survey as: playing  		(under age 5), attending school (ages 5-17), working or keeping house (ages  		18-64), and living independently (for the elderly).</p>
<p>Work disability measures are applied in determining the level of  		disability among the working-age population. Levels of work disability  		typically include being completely prevented from working, being limited in the  		amount or kind of work, and being able to work only occasionally, irregularly,  		or part-time because of a health condition or impairment.</p>
<p>The activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of  		daily living (IADLs), perhaps the severest forms of disability, measure the  		ability to live independently. The 6 or 7 standard ADL items are bathing,  		dressing, eating, toileting (including going to the toilet), getting in or out  		of a bed or chair (transferring), and sometimes walking. IADLs typically  		include using the telephone, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework and/or  		laundry, doing yard work, managing personal finances, and taking medications.  		ADL measures are limited to persons over the age of 4 and IADLs over the age of  		17. IADL measures are only used for adults aged 18 or over.</p>
<p>The presence of ADL limitations (for all but acute conditions) means  		that some kind of long-term care is needed, because basic activities cannot be  		performed without help either from another person or from assistive devices  		(i.e. wheelchair). ADLs and IADLs are critical for programmatic as well as  		research reasons, because their presence may signal who might be eligible for  		programs. Among the elderly, ADLs and IADLs are significant predictors of  		admission to a nursing home, use of paid home care, use of physician services,  		insurance coverage, and death. (Weiner 1990)</p>
<p>Other major functional measure of disability include the presence of  		sensory impairments (seeing, hearing, speaking), the set of WHO functions which  		measure the functioning capacity of specific body systems (i.e. climbing  		stairs, working 3 blocks, lifting 10 lbs), and the AMA Committee on Medical  		Rating of Mental and Physical Impairment of 1958.</p>
<p>Childhood disability measures, particularly for infants and toddlers,  		are perhaps the hardest to construct. Playing and attending school--usual  		activities for children--are harder to assess than, say, working for adults. In  		addition, childhood disabilities can be easily confused with "normal"  		developmental delays.</p>
<p>Mental or emotional disabilities are also needed in order to fully  		describe the extent of disability, but functional aspects of mental or  		emotional conditions/impairments, such as cognitive impairments, senility,  		mental illness, mental retardation, learning disabilities, are hard to measure  		and define. No one agreed upon set of "psychological ADLs" exists.</p>
<p>Programmatic definitions of disability are developed with the specific  		administration of Federal programs in mind. Disability programs are established  		through legislation, which also often contains program goals, programmatic  		definitions, and eligibility criteria (<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>).  		Eligibility criteria, in turn, frequently consist of functional definitions of  		disability (i.e. blindness, ADLs). Together, definitions and eligibility  		criteria in the eligibility process are used to determine who is admitted to  		programs. Eligibility processes are almost always complex and consist of  		programmatic definitions (tending to be broad), accompanied by specific  		eligibility criteria (tending to be narrow).</p>
<p>Depending on the purpose of the program, programmatic definitions can  		typically include many other factors besides disability. Many of these other  		factors are themselves hard to define. They include age, income, veterans'  		status, work experience, and employment.</p>
<h2><a name="federal" id="federal">III. OVERVIEW OF FEDERAL DISABILITY PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<p>Nearly every Department in the Federal government has a program targeted  		on disability. These disability programs all have unique purposes and offer a  		wide range of services. These services can be generally categorized into those  		which: (1) provide include support (cash assistance)--SSDI, SSI, and Black  		Lung; (2) provide health insurance and direct medical care--Medicare, Medicaid,  		the DVA Health Services Program, and CHAMPUS for the Handicapped; (3) financed  		a range of direct supportive services--Administration on Developmental  		Disabilities program, the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, and the  		Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grant, State Grants for Children  		with Disabilities, State Operated Programs for Handicapped Children, Preschool  		Grants Program, and Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program, and (4)  		pertain to rehabilitation--Basic Vocational Rehabilitation Service Program.</p>
<p>The Federal government is also involved in funding basic research  		designed to enable persons with disabilities to lead independent lives. For  		example, there are programs in NASA, the DVA, and DoD's National Strategic  		Defense Initiative which adapt defense and space-age technology for  		rehabilitative uses. In FY 1991, Congress mandated the establishment of the  		National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) within the National  		Center for Child Health and Human Development at NIH.</p>
<h2><a name="specific" id="specific">IV. SPECIFIC PROGRAM DEFINITIONS AND  		DESCRIPTIONS</a></h2>
<h3>A. ADA</h3>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a major piece of civil rights  		legislation signed into law in July 1991, protects the civil rights of persons  		with disabilities. Equal opportunity provisions for persons with disabilities  		are contained in the ADA regarding employment, public accommodation,  		transportation, State and local government services, and telecommunications.  		Some provisions of the ADA were effective immediately while others will be  		implemented in the future. As befits civil rights legislation, a broad overall  		programmatic Federal definition of disability is contained in the ADA. The ADA  		definition is: "an individual must meet one of the following three tests: (a)  		have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of  		the major life activities of such individual; (b) have a record of such an  		impairment; or (c) be regarded as having an impairment. The ADA definition is  		identical to the one used in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and  		in the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988.</p>
<h3>B. SSA Definition</h3>
<p>The SSA disability definition, which is used by the Social Security  		Administration to determine eligibility for both SSDI and SSI, is perhaps the  		most important and far-reaching programmatic definition. This definition  		essentially also determines eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid--the two  		companion health care programs for SSDI and SSI recipients, respectively.  		Together, these four programs--SSDI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid--are the  		largest Federal programs targeted on persons with disabilities. Thus, the SSA  		definition accounts for approximately 60% of Federal outlays targeted on  		nonelderly persons withs disabilities. (Burwell, Committee on Ways and Means,  		1991)</p>
<h3>C. SSDI</h3>
<p>The SSDI program provides monthly cash benefits to disabled workers  		under age 65 and to certain of their dependents. SSDI, enacted in 1956, is the  		primary social insurance program in the country which protects workers from  		loss of income due to disability. SSDI is not a means-tested program, but a  		certain number of insured work-quarters are required. Insured work quarters are  		those 3-month calendar year quarters in which an individual works, is covered  		by Social Security, and earns a specified amount ($540 per quarter in  		1991).<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Dependent coverage is offered through SSDI to certain disabled persons.  		Disabled individuals can receive SSDI in three ways: on their own as disabled  		workers, as widows or widowers of an SSDI beneficiary (if they are aged 50-59),  		and as adults (aged 18-64) disabled in childhood. This latter group consists of  		adults disabled before age 22 whose parent(s) are either an SSDI beneficiary, a  		Social Security retiree, or deceased (but insured under SSA). Typically, these  		individuals tend to be mentally retarded/developmental disabilities. Provisions  		for disabled widows/widowers and adults disabled in childhood were intended to  		provide coverage for those who would be unlikely to ever accrue enough Social  		Security work quarters to become eligible to retire on their own. The specific  		programmatic definition of disability for adults disabled in childhood is  		identical to the one used to determine eligibility for disabled workers. In  		general, there are different rules for determining disability for the  		statutorily blind (i.e. those with central visual, acuity of 20/200 or less in  		the better eye with the use of correcting lens), widows/widowers, and surviving  		divorced wives--i.e. age, education, and work experience are not considered for  		disabled widows/widowers. Dependent coverage is also provided to certain  		non-disabled family members (spouses who are either aged 60 or over or who care  		for one or more entitled children under age 16). SSDI benefits end at age 65  		when a worker retired on disability becomes (for SSA purposes) a worker retired  		due to old-age. At the end of 1989, 3.6 million disabled Americans received  		SSDI benefits: 2.9 million workers, 103 thousand widows/widowers, and 586  		thousand adults disabled in childhood. The average monthly benefit was $556 for  		disabled workers, $381 for disabled widows/widowers, and $378 for adults  		disabled in childhood. (SSA)</p>
<h3>D. SSDI Eligibility Process</h3>
<p>Under the disability determination process for SSDI, individuals are  		judged on whether or not they meet the SSA definition. This definition is based  		on the inability to work:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"The law defines disability as the inability to do any substantial  		  gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental  		  impairment which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be  		  expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. To meet  		  this definition, you must have a severe impairment, which makes you unable to  		  do your previous work or any other kind of substantial gainful activity which  		  exists in the national economy. To determine you are unable to do any other  		  work, we consider your residual functional capacity and your age, education and  		  work experience."</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individuals initially file in one of the 1,300 SSA field offices. A  		5-month waiting period after the onset of the impairment is required before  		eligibility. The 5 sequential steps needed to determine disability are:</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Is the individual engaging in substantial gainful activity  		(SGA)</b>? The purpose of the first step is to determine if the claimant can  		work. The level of work is currently set at $500 per month for disabled and  		$810 for blind claimants. No matter how extensive their disability, persons  		earning more than the SGA are automatically denied SSDI. Information on  		individuals who pass the first step is forwarded to the State DDS.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Does the individual have a severe impairment(s)</b>? The  		purpose of this second step is to determine if the claimant's impairment(s) is  		severe and if it is expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death.  		This determination is made at the State DDS by a team consisting of a  		disability examiner and a physician. The claimant does not appear before the  		team. The decision is based on medical and vocational information sent to the  		team.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Are the impairment(s) so severe as to meet or equal the  		requirements of the medical listing in the regulations</b>? A claimant's  		medical condition or conditions are compared to the over 100 impairments  		contained in the SSA Listing of Impairments. These impairments are described as  		a combination of signs, symptoms, functioning, measurements (i.e. IQ scores),  		or laboratory findings. Examples of medical impairments which are deemed  		sufficient to prevent an individual from working at the SGA level include: loss  		of 2 limbs, fracture of vertebra with cord involvement (substantiated by  		appropriate sensory and motor loss), IQ of 60-69 and a physical or mental  		impairment imposing additional significant work-related limitation of  		functioning, and remaining vision in better eye after best correction of 20/200  		or less. (Mather) If the claimant's condition meets or exceeds those in the  		Listing, then he or she is awarded SSDI benefits, if not, he or she  		proceeds.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Does the individual have any impairment(s) which prevent past  		relevant work</b>? The DDS team determines at this point whether the claimant  		can do his or her former job and to determine what (if any) particular types of  		work on a regular and continuing basis can be done despite the presence of  		impairments. In order to do this, the claimant's residual functional capacity  		is assessed. Assessments are made of physical abilities (i.e. strength,  		walking, standing, lifting, carrying, reaching, handling), mental abilities  		(i.e. the ability to understand, carry out and remember instructions, and  		respond appropriately in work settings), and other impairments (i.e. sensory,  		pain). If the individual's impairments prevent past relevant work, he or she  		proceeds to the final step. Information about the specific types of functioning  		needed in the claimant's past job are used to make this assessment.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Can the individual do other types of work</b>? Based on the  		cumulative effects of age, education, and experience the individual is judged  		by the DDS team on whether or not he or she can perform work in the national  		economy. In general, persons under 50 are considered to be able to adapt to new  		work situations. Education is judged in terms of the number of years of formal  		training or the ability to communicate in English. For those without formal  		education, other factors (hobbies, daily activities or testings) are used to  		determine intellectual capacity. Work experience pertains to those skills  		learned in the job. Jobs are said to exist in the national economy when there  		are significant numbers with requirements which meet the specific functional  		needs of claimants. Isolated jobs which exist in only a few parts of the  		country outside of where the claimant lives are not regarded as "in the  		national economy".</p>
<p>Most of those admitted onto SSDI are determined to be eligible, because  		they meet (59%) or equal (12%) the listings--Step 3. For the remaining 29%,  		medical and vocational criteria in Steps 4 and 5 are considered. For those  		denied admittance, 15% did not meet duration requirements (Step 2), 21% did not  		have severe enough impairments (Step 3), 31% were determined to be able to  		perform their usual work (Step 4), 26% to do other work (Step 5), and 6% were  		denied for other reasons. (Mather)</p>
<p>During FY 1990, 39% of the nearly 1.6 million persons who applied for  		SSDI were initially awarded benefits. About half of the 61% who were denied  		benefits appealed. In turn, about 27% of those initially denied benefits were  		later determined to be eligible. Altogether, about 55% of those who initially  		apply are eventually awarded benefits. (Committee on Ways and Means, 1991)</p>
<h3>E. SSI</h3>
<p>The SSI program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income aged,  		blind, and disabled persons. There are no work requirements. Nonelderly persons  		who apply for SSI must meet both the SSA definition of disability and financial  		criteria for the SSI means-test. Persons aged 65 or over need only meet the  		means-test. The SSI program is administered by SSA, but many States also choose  		to supplement Federal payments.</p>
<p>Unlike SSDI, blind or disabled children can receive SSI. Programmatic  		definitions of disability differ for adults and children. The adult definition  		is based on the inability to work. Children are not expected to work, so the  		notion of comparable severity is used, that is, children's disabilities must be  		comparable to those of adults. The Supreme Court, in a recent decision  		(<b>Sullivan vs Zebley</b>) affirmed a Court of Appeals decision which found  		that SSA erred in using a stricter test for disabled children than for disabled  		adults who apply for SSI. This decision will increase the number of children on  		SSI.</p>
<p>Disability determination for adults has two components: a matching of a  		list of impairments (equivalent to Step 3 of the SSDI eligibility process) and  		a functional test of the ability of the applicant to engage in SGA (Steps 4 and  		5). Children are also matched to a list of impairments, but there is no test  		comparable to the adult work tests. However, while an assessment of the impact  		of the impairment on the child's ability to carry out expected age-related  		activities was generally carried out, the Court ruled that an individualized  		functional assessment needed to be done. However, the Court did not identify a  		method to accomplish this assessment.</p>
<p>Unlike SSDI, when a blind or disabled person SSI recipient attains 65,  		he or she is still usually considered for program purposes to be blind or  		disabled. Thus, blind/disabled SSI recipients can be any age. In December 1989,  		3.1 million blind or disabled persons received SSI--2.8 million adults and 300  		thousand children. The average monthly SSI benefit was $309 for adults and $358  		for children. (Burwell, SSA)</p>

<p>Medicare, enacted in 1965, provides health insurance coverage to aged  		and disabled persons insured under Social Security. There are two ways that  		persons under age 65 can be eligible for Medicare: (1) by receiving SSDI  		benefits for at least 24 months (the two year waiting period) or (2) by being  		in the Early Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program. Those in the ESRD portion of  		Medicare must have ESRD and require renal dialysis or a kidney transplant and  		either be insured themselves through Social Security or be the spouse or  		dependent child of an insured worker/retiree. There is a 3 month waiting period  		for ESRD beneficiaries. Nonelderly persons on Medicare who are eligible for  		SSDI range in age from 20 through 64, while ESRD patients can be any age from  		infancy onwards. In 1989, 29.9 million aged, 3.2 million disabled persons under  		age 65, and 58 thousand persons with ESRD were eligible for Medicare. (SSA)</p>
<h3>G. Medicaid</h3>
<p>Medicaid is a joint Federal-State program which pays for the health care  		of low-income individuals. Cash assistance from the AFDC program automatically  		entitles persons to Medicaid coverage, while receipt of SSI usually guarantees  		Medicaid coverage. There are also a number of optional State programs through  		which ill or disabled persons can receive Medicaid, but most (79 percent)  		persons with disabilities are eligible for Medicaid by virtue of SSI.</p>
<p>Medicaid eligibility is very complex and varies from State to State.  		People with comparable illnesses, disabilities, and incomes can be eligible for  		Medicaid in one State, but not in another. SSI receipt also guarantees  		eligibility for Medicaid in most States. However, States may impose  		additionally more restrictive eligibility criteria for Medicaid than for SSI in  		the 13 209(b) States of which 3 (Indiana, Missouri, and New Hampshire) employ  		more restrictive definitions of disability than that used by SSA--the latter 2  		exclude children on SSI from Medicaid. In 10 other States (Connecticut, Hawaii,  		Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,  		and Virginia), States use the same definition of disability, but more  		restrictive financial criteria than that used by SSI. SSI recipients in these  		States can become eligible for Medicaid by incurring certain amounts of medical  		expenses, that is by "spending down". (Committee on Ways and Means, 1991)</p>
<p>States have a variety of ways in which they can extend Medicaid to  		disabled persons who do not receive SSI. These include the medically needy  		programs, optional coverage of noninstitutionalized children, and the Section  		2176 Home and Community-Based waiver program.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Medically Needy</b> programs are present in 35 States, 4  			 Territories and the District of Columbia. These provisions extend Medicaid  			 coverage to disabled persons who apply for SSI, meet the SSA definition of  			 disability, but whose incomes are slightly above SSI levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Optional coverage of noninstitutionalized children</b> began in  			 1982. Under this provision, States are allowed to extend Medicaid to all  			 disabled children who live at home, regardless of family income, as long as  			 their disabilities are severe enough to qualify for placement in an  			 institution. As of July 1989, 19 States and the District of Columbia have this  			 provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The Section 2176 Home and Community-Based Care Waiver</b> program  			 has been elected by 41 States. One intent of this program is to keep disabled  			 persons in the community rather than in institutions. Specifically, States can  			 provide home and community-based services not otherwise included in their State  			 Medicaid plans to disabled persons living in the community who would otherwise  			 reside in institutions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition to the SSA definition of disability, State Medicaid programs  		may use functional criteria for coverage of nursing home services, home health  		services, personal care services, home and community-based waiver services, and  		other Medicaid-covered services. Thus, 2 levels of disability criteria may be  		applied--1 to determine overall Medicaid eligibility and 1 to determine  		eligibility for specific covered services. The new Medicaid Home and Community  		care option in OBRA 1990 uses selected ADLs for eligibility, specifically  		toileting, transferring, and eating. During 1989, about 24.7 million persons  		received Medicaid of which nearly 3.5 million were disabled. (Burwell)</p>
<h3>H. Black Lung</h3>
<p>Black Lung benefits are paid to coal miners who are totally disabled as  		a result of pneumoconiosis (a disease of the lungs caused by the habitual  		inhalation of irritant mineral or metallic particles), to widows of miners who  		died from Black Lung disease, and to their dependents. Almost 226 thousand  		persons were paid Black Lung benefits in 1989. (Burwell, SSA)</p>
<h3>I. VA Disability Compensation and Pensions</h3>
<p>The Veterans Disability Compensation program, administered by the DVA,  		provides cash assistance to veterans with service-connected disabilities, that  		is, they incurred illness or injury while in service. Illness, injury, or  		disease manifestations must arise during service, but time can elapse. In order  		to receive benefits, a veteran must first apply to one of 58 regional offices  		located across the country (one in the Philippines). The application is  		evaluated by a ratings board, made up of two lay people and a physician. SSDI,  		SSI, and Black Lung ahve an "all or nothing disability determination process"  		wherein a person either is or is not determined to receive benefits. However, a  		range or band of eligibility exists in the Veterans Disability Compensation  		program. This range is the ratings system of disabilities. The ratings range  		from 0 to 100 percent and are based on the presumed drop in income caused by  		the disability. Employment is not a factor--veterans can be employed and still  		receive benefits.</p>
<p>The Veterans' Disability Pension programs pays cash benefits to elderly  		low-income war veterans who have become permanently and totally disabled from  		non-service-connected causes. This program is similar to SSDI in that there are  		employability standards. Both of these VA pensions are also available to  		survivors. In 1989, 2.2 million veterans with service-connected disabilities  		and 1.2 million without service-connected disabilities received pensions.  		(Committee on Ways and Means)</p>
<h3>J. Veterans' Health Services</h3>
<p>The Veterans' Health Services programs, administered by the DVA,  		consists of a nationwide health care network which provides medical care to  		eligible veterans. Services must be provided to veterans with a  		service-connected disability, former POW's, and those with low-incomes. Other  		veterans are served on a space available basis.</p>
<h3>K. CHAMPUS for the Handicapped</h3>
<p>The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services  		(CHAMPUS) program for the Handicapped is intended to finance services for  		severely disabled spouses or children of active-duty military personnel after  		all other sources have been exhausted. The program is small--only 2,500 persons  		were covered during FY 1987 (Burwell).</p>
<h3>L. Social Services Block Grant</h3>
<p>Federal funding for social services targeted on persons is provided to  		States and Territories through the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program,  		which is administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF),  		DHHS. The SSBG was authorized under Title XX of the Social Security Act, as  		amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. Some of these funds  		can be targeted to people with disabilities. If so, States can use their  		definitions of disability. Types of services provided include services for  		children and adults in foster care, services related to the management and  		maintenance of the home, day care, transportation, employment services,  		information and referral counseling services, preparation and delivery of  		meals, and health support services. In FY 1986 States spent $293 million on the  		developmentally disabled. (Burwell)</p>
<h3>M. Administration on Developmental Disabilities</h3>
<p>The goal of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD)  		program (in ACF) is to help States assure that their developmentally disabled  		residents are given the best opportunity through increased independence,  		productivity, and integration into the community.</p>
<p>Many disabling conditions result in a developmental disability (DD), the  		most common of which is mental retardation. Other frequent conditions include  		cerebral palsy, autism, and epilepsy. However, the DD definition is functional  		not medical and must occur before age 22. In according with the Developmental  		Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1987, a person has  		a DD if there are substantial functional limitations in at least 3 of the  		following major life activities (self-care, receptive and expressive language,  		learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and  		economic self-sufficiency). The 4 ADD program components are: (1) <b>the Basic  		State Grant program</b>, which provides funds for planning and administrative  		activities and the development of new programs; (2) <b>the Protection and  		Advocacy program</b>, which is basically a referral program designed to help  		people obtain educational, employment, guardianship, transportation, and  		housing services; (3) <b>the University-Affiliated program</b>, serves to train  		personnel who will serve the developmentally disabled population; and, (4)  		<b>the Projects of National Significance Grants</b>, support demonstrations,  		research, and evaluation projects.</p>
<p>In FY 1986, approximately 57 thousand persons were served through the  		Basic State Grants programs and 250 thousand professionals, parents, and  		volunteers were trained through the University-Affiliated program  		(Burwell).</p>
<h3>N. Maternal and Child Health Block Grant--Programs for  		Children with Special Needs</h3>
<p>These programs consist of grants to States. State programs are typically  		run out of clinics with a mix of medically oriented (i.e. screening and  		treatment) and social services (case management and counseling). There are no  		Federal criteria for defining children with special health care needs. These  		programs primarily served children with crippling conditions such as polio and  		cerebral palsy. These programs have expended to serve children with a wide  		range of chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Programs for Children with Special Needs are one component of the entire  		Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program in ACF. In 1980, States spent 20%  		(amounting to nearly $99 million) on children with special needs (Burwell).</p>
<h3>O. Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services Block  		Grant</h3>
<p>Services are to be targeted to individuals with chronic mental illness,  		severely mentally disturbed children and adolescents, mentally ill elderly  		individuals and other identifiable populations which are underserved. There is  		no Federal definition or requirement as to who can be covered. As with other  		block grants, States have discretion over who is served. Funds can be used to  		support community mental health centers and to otherwise support this  		population.</p>
<p>In FY 1988, $487 million were allocated by the Federal government for  		this program. That amount was reallocated among the States in proportion to  		their population and per capita income.</p>
<h3>P. Department of Education's Educational Programs</h3>
<p>The Department of Education (Ded) administers 4 educational programs in  		order to support State efforts in special education and related services for  		children with disabilities from birth until the age of 21 and the Vocational  		Rehabilitation program. The evaluation and determination of disability for all  		educational programs are carried out by a multi-disciplinary team. 3 of the 4  		educational programs (all but the Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities  		Program) use the same definition of disability. In the other 3 programs, the  		term "children with disabilities" means children (a) with mental retardation,  		hearing impairments including deafness, speech or language impairments, visual  		impairments including blindness, serious emotional disturbance, orthopedic  		impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or  		specific learning disabilities; and (b) who, by reason thereof need special  		education and related services. For ages 3-5 only, the term "children with  		disabilities" may (at a State's discretion) include children: (a) experiencing  		developmental delays, as defined by the State and as measured by appropriate  		diagnostic instruments and procedures, in one or more of the following areas:  		physical development, cognitive development, communication development, social  		or emotional development, or adaptive development; and (b) who, by reason  		thereof need special education and related services.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>State Grants for Children with Disabilities</b>, provide a free  			 appropriate public education to all children aged 3-21 with disabilities. In FY  			 1991, Federal funding totaled $1.85 billion. During the 1986-87 school year,  			 4.2 million children were served.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>State Operated Programs for Handicapped Children</b>, expand or  			 improve educational services to children with disabilities from birth until 21  			 currently enrolled in State operated or supported schools. In FY 1991, $149  			 million was granted to the States. During the 1986-87 school year, 255 thousand  			 children were served.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities</b>, provides a  			 free appropriate public education to children with disabilities between the  			 ages of 3 and 5, as well as 2-year olds who will become 3 during the school  			 year. Federal funding for FY 1991 totaled $293 million. Funds are used to serve  			 and identify these children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program</b> serves  			 children ages birth-2 with disabilities, as well as those who will turn 3  			 during the school year. The program goal is to improve the provision of early  			 intervention services for these children so that they will less likely to need  			 further special educational services in the future. The term "infants and  			 toddlers with disabilities" means individuals who need early intervention  			 services because they: (a) are experiencing developmental delays, as measured  			 by appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures in one or more of the  			 following areas: cognitive development, physical development, language and  			 speech (communication) development, psychosocial (social or emotional)  			 development, or self-help skills (adaptive development); or (b) have a  			 diagnosed physical or mental condition which has a high probability of  			 resulting in developmental delay. States have the discretion to serve  			 individuals who are risk of having substantial developmental delays if early  			 intervention services are not provided. Each State develops its own working  			 definition of developmental delay. Federal funds in FY 1991 totaled $117  			 million.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Q. Basic Vocational Rehabilitation Services</h3>
<p>The Basic Vocational Rehabilitation Services program, established in  		1920, is one of the oldest disability programs in this country. It is  		administered through State (or Territorial) VR Agencies by the Rehabilitation  		Services Administration. The purpose of the program is to help people with  		disabilities to reach gainful employment. Specific services include counseling  		and guidance, physical and mental restoration services, and vocational and  		other training services. In order to qualify, an individual must have the  		presence of a physical or mental disability which constitutes or results in a  		substantial handicap to employment and a reasonable expectation that vocational  		rehabilitation services may benefit the individual in terms of employability.  		SSDI beneficiaries considered to be good candidates for rehabilitation are  		routinely referred to State VR Agencies. In FY 1987, $7.1 million in Federal  		grants were awarded to State VR agencies, which served 917 thousand people  		(Burwell).</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">V. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>The huge number of Federal programmatic definitions appears daunting at  		first, but some definitions fold into each other. The Social Security  		definition is the most far-reaching as it determines eligibility for 4 major  		programs--SSDI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid. Similarly, the DEd uses basically  		the same definition for 3 out of 4 education programs.</p>
<p>Programmatic definitions are constructed with the legislative intent of  		the particular program in mind. The purpose of the legislation is to determine  		the purpose of the program, who (or which population) will be served, what  		programmatic definitions will be used, and how duration and severity will be  		addressed. Specific population groups targeted for disability programs can be  		divided by factors such as age (i.e. SSDI for working-age adults and children  		for the DEd's programs), disease (i.e. Black Lung), economic status (i.e. SSI),  		other characteristics (i.e. veterans status for DVA program), or combinations  		of these factors. Like disability, many of these population characteristics are  		also hard to define.</p>
<p>Duration and severity can be defined differently, i.e. the Social  		Security definition only pertains to so-called permanent disabilities, while  		the State-run Workers' Compensation programs, recovery is an everyday feature,  		as recipients can receive benefits for a short time, recover, and return to  		work. Program eligibility thresholds also vary, i.e. the Social Security  		definition is an "all or nothing" concept where there are only 2 outcomes--an  		individual is deemed either eligible or ineligible for benefits. But the  		Veterans' Disability Compensation program contains degrees (or percentage  		ratings) of disability depending on severity.</p>
<p>Changes occur in programmatic definitions or even the titles of  		programs, i.e. the Handicapped Infants and Toddlers Program is now called the  		Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program. Future definitions and  		eligibility criteria may be based more on the use of ADLs, IADLs, and cognitive  		impairments. A number of recent Congressional bills propose program eligibility  		for Federal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, on the basis of these  		factors. These measures were never designed for program eligibility, but their  		widespread use among researchers and relative ease of understanding has made  		them appealing. Changes in the underlying more research-oriented concepts of  		disability definitions and medical criteria are also under consideration (i.e.  		revision of the ICIDH and the <b>AMA's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent  		Impairment</b>). In addition, a PHS Task Force, chaired by the Agency for  		Health Care Services Research, was recently formed to develop a strategy for a  		better scientific basis for the determination of disability, particularly for  		programmatic reasons.</p>
<p>Finally, currently no data or reporting requirements exist either for or  		in the ADA. However, definitions of disability will play a major role in order  		to derive the prevalence rates and evaluation data that will almost certainly  		be required to evaluate employment and other provisions of the ADA.</p>

</tr><tr><td><font><b>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</b>: An  			 individual must meet one of the following three tests: (a) have a physical or  			 mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life  			 activities of such individual; (b) have a record of such an impairment; or (c)  			 be regarded as having an impairment. (Same as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation  			 Act of 1973 and the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988.)</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH  			 AND HUMAN SERVICES</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)</b>:  			 An individual must have an inability to engage in any substantial gainful  			 activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment  			 which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to  			 last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. To meet this  			 definition, an individual's impairment or combination of impairments must be so  			 severe that he or she is unable to do past work, but cannot, considering age,  			 education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful  			 activity which exists in the national economy. SSDI benefits are also paid to  			 dependents (age 18-64) of retired, deceased or disabled workers provided they  			 were disabled in childhood, and widows/widowers aged 50 or over who were  			 married to SSDI beneficiaries. There are different rules for determining  			 disability for those who are statutorily blind (i.e. with central visual,  			 acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of correcting lens),  			 widow/widowers, and surviving divorced wives.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</b>:  			 Individuals can qualify as disabled or blind. For disability, an individual  			 must have an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason  			 of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be  			 expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a  			 continuous period of not less than 12 months. For blindness, an individual must  			 be statutorily blind, that is, having central visual, acuity of 20/200 or less  			 in the better eye with the use of correcting lens. <em>Adults</em>: To meet  			 this definition, an individual's impairment or combination of impairments must  			 be so severe that he or she is unable to do past work, but cannot, considering  			 age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial  			 gainful activity which exists in the national economy. <em>Children</em>: A  			 child under age 18 will be considered disabled for purposes of eligibility if  			 he suffers from any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of  			 "comparable severity" to that which would make an adult disabled.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Social Services Block Grant</b>: There is no  			 Federal statutory definition. States set their own criteria for determining  			 disability.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Administration on Developmental Disabilities  			 Program</b>: An individual must have a severe, chronic disability which is  			 attributable to a mental and/or physical impairment; is manifested before the  			 person attains age 22, is likely to continue indefinitely; reflects the  			 person's need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary or  			 generic care, treatment or other services which are of a lifelong or extended  			 duration and are individually planned and coordinated; and results in  			 substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of  			 major life activities: (1) self care; (2) receptive and expressive language;  			 (3) learning; (4) mobility; (5) self-direction; (6) capacity for independent  			 living.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Maternal and Child Health Block Grant--Programs  			 for Children with Special Needs</b>: There are no Federal criteria for defining  			 children with special health care needs. These programs primarily served  			 children with crippling conditions such as polio and cerebral palsy. However,  			 these programs have expended to serve children with a wide range of chronic  			 health conditions.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b>Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services  			 Block Grant</b>: There are no Federal requirements. States have discretion over  			 who is served. However, services are to be targeted to individuals with chronic  			 mental illness, severely mentally disturbed children and adolescents, mentally  			 ill elderly individuals and other identifiable populations which are  			 underserved.</font></td>

</tr><tr><td><font><b>Medicaid</b>: A disabled individual must receive  			 SSI in most States. Thirteen States use the 209(b) program option. They may  			 impose additionally more restrictive eligibility criteria for Medicaid than for  			 SSI. Three of these (Indiana, Missouri, and New Hampshire) employ more  			 restrictive definitions of disability than that used by SSA and the latter two  			 exclude children on SSI from Medicaid. In ten other States (Connecticut,  			 Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,  			 Oklahoma, and Virginia), States use the same definition of disability, but more  			 restrictive financial criteria than that used by SSI. In addition, State  			 Medicaid programs may use functional criteria for coverage of nursing home  			 services, home health services, personal care services, home and  			 community-based waiver services, and other Medicaid-covered services. Two  			 levels of disability criteria may be applied--one to determine overall Medicaid  			 eligibility and one to determine eligibility for specific covered  			 services.</font></td>
