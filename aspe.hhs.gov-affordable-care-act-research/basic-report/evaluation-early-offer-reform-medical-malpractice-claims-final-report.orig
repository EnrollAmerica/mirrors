</dl><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Many observers have concluded that the medical malpractice litigation  		system needs improvement. Medical malpractice cases are extremely complicated,  		requiring proof of injury, proof of the health care providers fault, and  		determination of economic and noneconomic damages. Some claimants who are  		injured through medical error receive significant awards or settlements, but  		often after long delay. In addition, the current system entails transaction  		costs, so that substantial shares of the medical malpractice insurance premium  		dollars go for litigation expenses and insurer overhead. Although many states  		have enacted medical malpractice litigation system reforms, such as caps on the  		amount of noneconomic damages, other reforms may have a more fundamental effect  		on medical malpractice litigation than these reforms. This report analyzes one  		specific alternative proposal, referred to as early offers, by  		assessing its performance using a database of actual malpractice claims.</p>
<p>Early offers provide a structured process for resolving medical  		malpractice cases shortly after they have been filed. If the defense chooses to  		do so, it may make a statutorily-defined financial offer, which the claimant  		can accept or reject. To comply with the early offer statute, the offer must  		completely cover the claimants economic damages plus appropriate  		attorneys fees. If the offer is rejected, the claimants burden of  		proof at any subsequent trial is increased. If the defense does not make an  		offer, the current system applies.</p>
<p>The basic goal of the early offer approach is to improve the performance  		of the system. For claimants, the advantage of the approach is that if they  		accept the offer, they are assured of compensation for their economic damages  		within six months after filing a claim, instead of the approximately 2-3 years  		that cases now require. For insurers and providers, if the offer is accepted,  		the damages amount paid is generally less than under the present tort system.  		Litigation expenses will be less, both for plaintiffs and defendants. There is  		also more predictable and prompter compensation for claimants attorneys  		than the current system provides. For claimants, defendants, and insurers, the  		early offer proposal reduces the uncertainty associated with the outcome of a  		prolonged litigation.</p>
<p>The analysis presented in this report indicates that early offers are  		likely to generate significant insurer savings through reduced payments for  		noneconomic damages. It will also reduce attorneys fees for both parties.  		Other things being equal, these savings could allow insurers to reduce premiums  		for malpractice insurance, thus enabling health care providers to reduce their  		fees. Ultimately, consumers, employers, and governments could benefit from  		reduced health insurance premiums and the reduced cost of care.</p>
<h3> Data</h3>
<p> This report uses medical malpractice data on closed claims from Texas  		and Florida to assess the performance of the early offer proposal. The primary  		analyses use the data provided by the Texas Department of Insurance because of  		their greater comprehensiveness. The report uses malpractice data from Florida  		data to impute data not included, or with incomplete information, in the Texas  		files. The Texas data are from the time period 1988-2002, before Texas modified  		its medical malpractice law in 2003, which significantly limited the award of  		noneconomic damages. Thus the data reflect the potential operation of an early  		offer law in a state without caps on noneconomic damages.</p>
<p>The Texas data involve all claims that were closed for an award or  		settlement greater than $10,000. The Texas data document that most claims are  		settled, with fewer than 1 percent of the settlements or awards the result of  		trial verdicts. The distribution of closed claims is highly skewed. One percent  		of the claims involve awards or settlements greater than $5 million, and 10  		percent are greater than $1 million, but 38 percent of the awards or  		settlements are between $10,000 and $100,000. The median closed claim has a  		settlement amount or court award of $156,707. Thirty-three percent of the  		closed claims involve the death of the victim and an additional 14 percent  		involve serious nonfatal injuries. Twenty-one percent involve children under  		age 18. </p>
<p>The average, as opposed to the median, claim involves a settlement or  		award of $458,000, of which 28 percent is allocated for economic loss. Only 3  		percent of cases involve exemplary damages, with the average settlement or  		award in those cases being $1,190,000, of which 21 percent is for economic  		loss. Another 4 percent of cases involve a settlement or award of $404,000, but  		no economic loss. The vast majority of cases (97 percent) do not involve  		exemplary damages, with an average settlement or award of $434,000 and an  		estimated economic loss of $124,000 (28 percent of the settlement or award).  		The settlement or award includes claimants attorney fees, normally set at  		one-third of any payment. </p>
<h3> Methodology</h3>
<p>The early offer proposal is a legal reform approach designed to provide  		prompt coverage of claimants economic losses and to reduce litigation  		costs.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> Under the early  		offer proposal for medical malpractice claims, within 180 days after a claim is  		filed, liability insurers for health care providers (hereafter referred to as  		insurers and providers) may offer claimants a payment equal to the  		claimants net economic loss (i.e., the loss beyond any other insurance  		applicable to the claim), plus reasonable legal fees, but nothing for pain and  		suffering damages. If the claimant does not accept this offer, the claimant can  		proceed with a normal tort claim for both economic and noneconomic damages, but  		the legal standards of both the burden of proof and level of misconduct applied  		to the claim would be raised, and the claimant would have to prove the  		defendants gross negligence beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>Insurers would decide whether to make an early offer by comparing the  		cost of the early offer to their expected cost under normal tort rules if the  		claim is not settled under the early offer proposal. This expected cost would  		equal the net economic damages (medical expense and wage loss but, as stated,  		not pain and suffering) plus an allowable payment of the claimants  		lawyers, which as an illustrative calculation is presumed to be 10 percent of  		the value of the early offer. That is, the insurer will make an offer if the  		expected liability and litigation costs if the claim is not settled under the  		early offer proposal are greater than the net economic damages and allowable  		claimants legal fees. </p>
<p>Thus, the insurer will make an early offer when the amount of the early  		offer is less than the insurers expected exposure from a full-scale tort  		claim. This formulation assumes that insurers act in a rational economic  		manner, are risk-neutral, and value payoffs according to their expected value.  		This report emphasizes the amounts that would be saved by insurers by making  		early offers, since such savings are a prerequisite to making early offers. But  		savings to insurers do not necessarily imply losses to claimants of an  		identical magnitude. Some of the savings are in terms of lowered transactions  		costs, such as attorneys fees, which will be reduced. Although claimants  		lose their normal recourse to full-scale tort litigation, such litigation has  		inherent uncertainties, delays, and transaction costs, as well as legal fees,  		which are deducted from any payment. Under the early offer proposal, claimants  		lose any rights only after they are guaranteed prompt payment of medical  		expenses and wage losses, plus reasonable attorneys fees.</p>
<p>Calculation of potential savings from the early offer reform requires a  		reference point for the computations. Three different points are possible using  		the Texas data: the insurers initial reserve set aside for payment of the  		claim, its final reserve, and the ultimate settlement or award. Both initial  		and final reserves include estimated defense attorneys fees, but the  		final reserve may be the most useful reference point because it is calculated  		at a point when more is known about the actual settlement or award and about  		actual defense attorneys fees. However, the savings computed from this  		reference point involves several key assumptions. Most notably, we must assume  		that the defense correctly estimates the expected value of the claim, and that  		the claimant accepts the early offer if one is made. An alternative reference  		point is the initial reserve. This measure proved to be less useful in the  		analyses, as many insurers typically underestimate this amount, thus making an  		early offer less likely.</p>
<h3> Results</h3>
<p> If the final reserve is the appropriate reference point for computing  		savings, the early offer reform could generate substantial savings. For those  		claims for which an early offer is desirable, the average insurer savings are  		$550,000 if based on the final reserve. Overall, insurers would find it  		desirable to make an early offer in 97 percent of the cases.</p>
<p>This report contains additional information on the early offer reform,  		including the likely impacts by type of injury (fatality, serious injury,  		etc.), and by whether deductions for collateral sources are included. If  		economic damages are reduced by deductions for other insurance, the results  		will be similar. The report also explores the effect of setting minimum amounts  		for cases of serious injury or death. A minimum of, say, $250,000 would often  		result in higher payments to the claimant if the offer were accepted than under  		the basic early offer computations. However, the higher the minimum offer, the  		less likely the insurer would be to make an offer, therefore reducing the  		savings from the reform. </p>
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>Based on the assumptions used in this report, the early offer reform  		could lead to insurer savings and speedy resolution of many cases if it were  		adopted. The main benefit to the claimant of the early offer reform is that if  		an offer is made and accepted, the claimant receives assurance of payment that  		covers their economic damages approximately six months after the claim is  		filed. For the average case, payment will be received approximately two years  		sooner than under the current system. </p>
<p>The disadvantage to the claimant of accepting the early offer is that  		the possibility of receiving noneconomic damages is eliminated. Since  		noneconomic damages often involve greater sums than economic damages, this loss  		is significant. In about 3 percent of the cases, the possibility of punitive  		plus noneconomic damages remains more likely if the offer is rejected and the  		claimant wins a verdict, but victory would not be assured since the burden of  		proof would be greater than it is now.</p>
<p>Insurers would only make offers in cases where the expected value of the  		outcome would result in savings. However, no offer for less than the amount of  		economic damages, plus appropriate attorneys fees, would gain the  		advantages of an early offer under the statute.</p>
<p>The extent to which these savings would be passed on through lower  		malpractice insurance premiums is unknown. However, assuming a competitive  		marketplace, one would expect that to happen.</p>
<h2> <a name="proposal" id="proposal">2. THE EARLY OFFER PROPOSAL</a></h2>
<p>The early offer proposal is a legal reform approach designed to provide  		prompt coverage of claimants economic losses and to reduce litigation  		costs. Under the early offer proposal for medical malpractice claims, within  		180 days after a claim is filed, liability insurers for health care providers,  		who hereafter will be referred to as insurers and providers, may offer  		claimants a payment equal to the claimants net economic loss (i.e., the  		loss beyond any other insurance applicable to the claim) plus reasonable legal  		fees. If the claimant does not accept this offer, the injured victim can  		proceed with a normal tort claim for both economic and noneconomic damages, but  		the legal standards of both the burden of proof and level of misconduct applied  		to the claim would be raised, and the claimant would have to prove gross  		negligence beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>Insurers would decide whether to make an early offer by comparing the  		cost of the early offer to their expected cost under normal tort rules if the  		claim is not settled under the early offer proposal; this expected cost would  		equal the net economic damages (medical expense and wage loss but not pain and  		suffering) plus an allowable payment of the claimants lawyers, which as  		an illustrative calculation is presumed to be 10 percent of the value of the  		early offer. That is, the insurer will make an offer if:</p>
<blockquote><p>Expected liability and litigation costs if the claim is not settled  		  under the early offer proposal &gt; Net economic damages + allowable  		  claimants legal fees. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, in keeping with an assumption that insurers act in a rational  		economic manner, the insurer will make an early offer when the amount of the  		early offer is less than the insurers expected exposure from a full-scale  		tort claim. Note that this formulation assumes that insurers are risk-neutral.  		Throughout this report we emphasize the amounts that would be saved by insurers  		by making early offers, since such savings are a prerequisite to making early  		offers. But savings to insurers do not necessarily imply losses to claimants of  		an identical magnitude. Some of the savings are in terms of lowered  		transactions costs, as attorneys fees will be reduced. Although claimants  		lose their normal recourse to full-scale tort litigation, such litigation has  		inherent uncertainties, delays, and transaction costs imposed on the  		plaintiffs, wholly apart from the legal fees. In addition, under the early  		offer proposal, plaintiffs lose any rights only after they are guaranteed  		prompt payment of medical expenses and wage losses, plus reasonable  		attorneys fees.</p>
<p>Early offer proposals can differ in several key points: the percentage  		share of the award allocated for the claimants legal expenses, the  		existence of an offset for collateral insurance payments, and the presence of a  		minimum payment level for different classes of injuries. In this report, we  		examine a base case early offer proposal and explore some representative  		sensitivity analyses, recognizing that our analysis does not exhaust all  		potentially attractive variants of the early offer approach.</p>
<p>This report uses Texas and Florida medical malpractice data on closed  		claims to assess the performance of the early offer proposal. The primary  		analyses use the Texas data because of their greater comprehensiveness, but we  		also use the Florida data to impute data not included, or with incomplete  		information, in the Texas files. The Texas data are from the time period  		1988-2002, before Texas modified its medical malpractice law in 2003 by, among  		other things, limiting noneconomic damages to $500,000. The effect of such  		modifications on post-2002 Texas cases is beyond the review of this study. Note  		too the data used herein is based on the final award or settlement actually  		paid, whether by settlement, trial, or appellate decision.</p>
<p>We structure the empirical analysis by considering issues in the  		following order. First, we describe the calculation of the components of the  		early offer proposal: namely, the insurers reserve set aside to pay the  		claim, as calculated both early and later in the claims process; actual  		settlement amounts and court awards; and claimants economic losses. We  		then calculate both the number of cases for which an early offer is attractive  		to the insurer as well as the average insurer savings if an early offer were in  		fact made and accepted. We perform the calculations by analyzing the data in  		two ways: by injury type (e.g., fatality or serious injury), and by type of  		damages (e.g., whether exemplary damages were reported, whether only  		noneconomic damages were reported, and whether both noneconomic and economic),  		but not exemplary, damages were reported, which is the more typical situation.  		The empirical assessment also examines alternative assumptions to include the  		effect of: (a) $100,000, (b) $250,000, or (c) $500,000 minimum payment amounts  		for deaths and serious injuries, and the effect of including offsetting  		collateral sources in determining net economic damages as part of the early  		offer. We also calculate how much time is saved if an early offer is made and  		accepted for each of these alternative specifications. In addition, we examine  		the effect on litigation cost savings, which consist mostly of attorneys  		fees, for both claimants and insurers.</p>

<h2><a name="context" id="context"> 3. EARLY OFFERS AND THE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE  		CONTEXT</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section3A" id="section3A"> 3A. The Medical Malpractice  		Context</a></h3>
<p>Numbered <a href="#itemi">Item i</a> and <a href="#itemii">Item ii</a>  		below present some of the main criticisms of current medical malpractice  		law.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> We do not purport  		to establish the validity of these criticisms, but we review them here to  		identify both the impetus for reform proposals as well as the role that the  		early offer proposal discussed herein can play in addressing these criticisms.  		Numbered <a href="#itemiii">Items iii</a>-xi below relate the early offer  		proposal studied in this report to the medical malpractice reform debate.  		<a href="#building">Sections 4</a>-8 of the report then present the financial  		effects of such a reform.</p>
<p><b><a name="itemi" id="itemi">i.</a></b> Many observers view the current system of  		tort liability for personal injury as unworkable and in need of fundamental  		reform. Under the current system, a claimant must prove two difficult elements:  		the defendant's fault, and the financial value of noneconomic damages, mostly  		for pain and suffering. In medical malpractice cases, determining fault is  		often especially complex, given the intricacies of medical decision contexts  		and the probabilistic consequences of medical interventions and their  		interaction with underlying patient characteristics. As a result, the system is  		subject to uncertainties that allow many injured patients to receive little or  		nothing while comparably injured others are paid much more than their economic  		losses. One earlier finding indicated that only 28 cents of the medical  		malpractice premium reaches claimants, and of that, only 12.5 cents goes to  		compensate for the actual expenses incurred by patients, with the rest going to  		legal fees, insurance overhead, and the like.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> All this uncertainty in turn generates  		substantial transaction costs (mostly legal fees on both sides, documented in  		this report) and long delays in any payment that is made (often up to 2-3  		years, as we show). In the end, the liability insurance system does not result  		in prompt payment to many needy victims; rather, it is a system of prolonged,  		unpredictable, expensive fights over whether claimants are deserving and/or  		what payment they deserve--a system that may operate to the detriment of health  		care professionals and seriously injured patients.</p>
<p><b><a name="itemii" id="itemii">ii.</a></b> The present system of tort liability  		insurance for medical injuries may lead to the anomalous result of providing  		the least protection to those who need it most: seriously injured parties whose  		medical expenses and wage losses exceed any applicable private or public  		insurance coverage. The present legal system in effect tells patients that they  		may be paid something, but only years from now and only after paying any  		recovery lawyers fees of 30 percent or higher. </p>
<p>The tort system imposes far fewer risks on the various medical  		malpractice liability participants who are not seriously injured victims.  		Health care providers typically have protection through their liability  		insurance coverage, and their insurers are protected by their risk-spreading,  		strengthened by actuarial calculations. Defense lawyers are paid, win or lose.  		Claimants lawyers have little incentive to take a case unless they are  		confident it is likely to lead to an expected payment in excess of their  		expenses and opportunity costs. Even if the risk of nonpayment for any given  		claim is high, the claimants lawyer can minimize this risk by taking  		multiple cases to assure portfolio diversification, a form of protection denied  		to the seriously injured victim, who normally will have only one such claim in  		a lifetime. Finally, the less seriously injured are protected more by the very  		fact of their lesser losses which may, in turn, be covered by their own health  		insurance or sick leave. </p>
<p><b><a name="itemiii" id="itemiii">iii.</a></b> The early offer reform addresses the  		main shortcomings of the current system. Before considering the benefits of  		early offers, it is useful to review their structure. Under such an approach, a  		defendant has the option (not the obligation) to offer an injured patient,  		within 180 days after a claim is filed, periodic payment of the claimant's net  		economic losses as they accrue.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Economic losses under an early offer statute  		must cover medical expenses, including rehabilitation plus lost wages, to the  		extent that all such costs are not already covered by other insurance  		(collateral sources), plus an additional 10 percent attorney's fee.  		Therefore, a defendant cannot make a lesser or low ball offer and  		still be covered by the statute. Nor is there any need for a court to determine  		whether the early offer is fair. The early offer statute defines the fairness  		of the offer, similar to a workers compensation statute for workplace  		accidents. </p>
<p>If an early offer is made and accepted, that, of course, settles the  		claim. If the defendant decides not to make an early offer, the injured patient  		can proceed with a normal tort claim for medical expense and wage loss plus  		pain and suffering. Alternatively, if the claimant declines an early offer in  		favor of litigation: (1) the standard of proof of misconduct is raised,  		allowing payment only where gross negligence is proven; and (2) the  		standard of proof is also raised, requiring proof of such misconduct beyond a  		reasonable doubt (or at least by clear and convincing evidence).</p>
<p><b><a name="itemiv" id="itemiv">iv.</a></b> Consider a typical case to illustrate  		how the early offer law would work. A patient has been injured in the course of  		treatment. If the patient wins in court, she would be awarded $1 million, but  		given the risks of litigation, she has only a 50 percent chance of winning.  		Roughly calculated, the patient has a claim worth about $500,000 (50 percent  		chance at $1 million). Assume the cost of setting aside a corpus of money to  		pay the patients net economic losses as they accrue is projected at about  		$250,000 (an often realistic assumption, as the following report demonstrates).  		The health care providers insurer would likely make the early offer,  		$250,000 being clearly less than $500,000. The patient would likely accept,  		given that under the early offer proposal the plaintiff will have the normally  		insuperable burden of proving her doctor guilty of gross negligence beyond a  		reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Now assume a change in the facts: same patient, same health care  		provider, and the same possible $1 million verdict. But here assume this  		patients chances of winning are only one in ten, with an expected value  		of $100,000 (one-tenth of $1 million). Here the defendants insurer would  		not make an early offer, $100,000 being clearly less than $250,000. </p>
<p><b><a name="itemv" id="itemv">v.</a></b> The fear of potentially higher costs to  		insurers under this early offer scheme is avoided because no defendants need  		make an offer if they would not do so without this statute. Claimants cannot  		demand an early offer. Thus, defendants will make an offer only when it makes  		economic sense for them to do so, as shown in the example above and in  		<a href="#proposal">Section 2</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="itemvi" id="itemvi">vi.</a></b> Will insurance companies thereby just  		cherry pick claims by making lower payments to clearly deserving  		claimants? Because of the uncertainty and cost of determining both liability  		and pain and suffering damages under present tort law, it is likely, as  		indicated in <a href="#itemiv">Item iv</a> above and the report itself below,  		that defendants in medical malpractice cases will make prompt early offers in  		many cases even when liability is unclear. </p>
<p><b><a name="itemvii" id="itemvii">vii.</a></b> The proposal would affect injury  		victims in many ways that are advantageous. While injury victims would lose  		their recourse to full-scale tort litigation, they would reduce their  		uncertainty, delays, and transaction costs. Moreover, they would lose their  		current tort litigation recourse only when they are guaranteed prompt payment  		of their actual economic losses plus attorney's fees. These prompt and certain  		payments will be especially advantageous to those seriously injured patients  		whose losses have outstripped other applicable coverage. Many claimants will,  		however, receive lower payment amounts unless there is a high minimum payment  		amount.</p>
<p><b>viii.</b> Several factors make it unattractive for early offers to be  		made voluntarily without an early offer statute. Defendants today may be  		confident of defeating or at least wearing down claimants, given the  		difficulties and delays in proving a tort claim. The long delay before trial  		may often enable defendants to bargain down even claimants clearly entitled to  		tort damages because the latter may need immediate money for accrued and  		accruing medical bills and wage loss. Furthermore, defendants may fear that an  		early offer to settle for claimants net economic loss will be seen as a  		signal of weakness and encourage claimants and their lawyers to seek an even  		larger settlement than originally sought. This mirrors the position of  		claimants and their lawyers, who similarly fear that an early offer to settle  		only for economic loss would be deemed an admission of weakness in their cases,  		resulting in either no payment or less than that otherwise sought. </p>
<p><b><a name="itemix" id="itemix">ix.</a></b> Early offers will be a viable mechanism  		only if defendants, not claimants, are allowed to make binding early offers. To  		see this, consider the alternative situation in which claimants and their  		counsel make binding early offers instead of defendants. If defendants are  		thereby bound by the early offer reform, then claimants would have the  		incentive to make nonmeritorious or marginal claims. But defendants, as the  		parties making payment, when confronted with clearly meritless or very marginal  		claims, will pay nothing and make no early offer, as shown in the example  		above. On the other hand, when faced with potentially meritorious claims,  		defendants will have an incentive to explore whether the statutorily-defined  		early offer involves less expected cost than a full-scale tort suit with all  		its uncertainty and transaction costs. Thus, only defendants have the  		appropriate incentives to distinguish carefully between arguably meritorious  		and clearly nonmeritorious claims in order to reduce costs by promptly paying  		the required minimum benefits in suitable cases.</p>
<p><b><a name="itemx" id="itemx">x.</a></b> There are also several rationales for why  		damages for pain and suffering are not included in the early offer reform. The  		uncertainty of determining both liability and damages for noneconomic damages  		is the key to understanding the inefficiencies of tort law and to framing a  		balanced solution that attempts to be fair to both injured patients and health  		care providers. As stated above, pain and suffering damages are indeterminate  		and highly volatile. Under an early offer system, the prospect of an award of  		pain and suffering damages still serves as a means of internalizing health care  		providers medical mishaps by providing an incentive to make early offers  		covering essential economic losses. These offers will provide prompt  		compensation to many victims of injuries that accompany the delivery of medical  		services. In effect, the threat of paying damages for pain and suffering,  		rather than the actual payments, will better serve injured patients as well as  		the public interest.</p>
<p>Pain and suffering damages also differ from economic damages from the  		standpoint of insurance. Because accidents and illnesses generally reduce the  		marginal utility of income, people do not generally find it desirable to  		purchase pain and suffering insurance.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> Indeed, no such general insurance market has  		emerged.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> In contrast,  		risk-averse individuals will desire full insurance of their economic losses,  		which is the focal point of the early offer proposal.</p>
<p>Because personal injury claims alone among all other damage claims  		routinely entail damages for both economic and noneconomic losses, defendants  		are uniquely positioned not only to make, but also to enforce by early offers,  		socially attractive settlements for only economic loss. In nonpersonal injury  		claims, where only economic damages are at stake, no comparably fair means are  		available to sanction a claimant who refuses to accept an offer of only a  		portion of the total losses claimed.</p>
<p><b><a name="itemxi" id="itemxi">xi.</a></b> A complete no-fault plan for medical  		injuries does not seem feasible. It is difficult to define in advance when  		no-fault benefits should be paid for injuries that arise from medical  		treatment. Under no-fault auto insurance policies, an accident victim is  		compensated for an injury arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or  		use of a motor vehicle. Under workers compensation laws, an  		industrial accident victim is compensated for an injury arising out of,  		and in the course of, employment. It is not feasible, however, to force  		all health care providers to pay patients for any and all adverse events  		arising in the course of medical treatment. It is often impossible to determine  		whether a patient was injured by the treatment rendered, or whether the adverse  		condition after treatment was just a normal extension of the condition which  		prompted treatment in the first place. A health care provider could not be  		expected to pay every patient whose condition worsens after treatment. Thus  		such a comprehensive <i>ex ante</i> no-fault solution seems unworkable, and  		therefore unavailable. The proposed early offer system for medical accidental  		injuries enables, when the facts are much better known, <i>ex post</i>  		comparisons of the cost of a tort claim versus that of an early offer, and so  		we conclude that this system is a workable, economical, equitable, and  		simplifying solution.</p>
<h3> <a name="section3B" id="section3B">3B. Some Operational Features of  		the Early Offer Plan</a></h3>
<p>It is useful to address some questions regarding the time frame for  		operation of the early offer plan. Is the 180-day period too short a time for  		the defendant to decide to make an early offer? In general, insurers already  		compute their initial reserve amounts in a much shorter period, and the  		preliminary discovery process would be accelerated by the early offer  		structure. In addition to doing research to decide whether to bring a claim,  		claimants and their lawyers can also take their time and press any discovery  		they deem necessary before responding to any early offer.</p>
<p>Court approval of the terms of an accepted early offer will no more be  		required than is court approval of the terms of a workers compensation  		case. Of course, there may be later disputes after an early offer settlement  		regarding what is due periodically as losses accrue in the future, but that may  		happen under workers compensation or any major medical/disability policy  		extending into the future. Courts now routinely review settlements in  		minors cases, a practice that presumably will continue. </p>
<p>An early offer settlement is no worse than lump-sum court awards in  		dealing with seemingly difficult questions, such as whether the claimants  		condition might change. The parties also might agree to a structured  		settlement. In the case of death, the survivors would be due the amount, if  		any, that the decedents earnings would have been expected to provide as  		support. Note that the Michigan no-fault auto law with its large wage loss  		coverage extending to the hundreds of thousands of dollars has been able to  		deal effectively with such matters.</p>
<p>The limit on claimant attorneys fees to 10 percent of the value of  		the early offer is a representative but plausible example. This percentage is  		based on a comparison of the almost uniform minimum of one-third of the value  		of a full-scale tort settlement or verdict and the claimants attorney  		fees under no-fault workers compensation, which are often limited to 10  		percent above a minimum payment.</p>
<p>Note further that by definition there will be no trial expenses under  		early settlements. Note too that: (1) the early settlement will also greatly  		diminish pretrial expenses, and (2) the 10 percent fee for claimants  		counsel would be exacted only after deducting any other expenses. Because the  		Texas data do not provide information on these expenses, we assume for purposes  		of the calculations that they are sufficiently small enough to be ignored in  		our estimates. If the 10 percent fee is manifestly too low because of special  		circumstances, claimants counsel can petition the court for an  		augmentation that will be payable by the early offerer.</p>
<h3> 3C. Overview of the Effects of Early Offers: Case Study  		of Serious Nonfatal Injuries</h3>
<p>This overview briefly describes the results of a statistical analysis of  		the early offer proposal described above and relates these results to the  		current medical malpractice outcomes. As indicated above, these statistics are  		based on extensive medical malpractice closed claim data required to be filed  		by pertinent insurers in Texas, which is supplemented by similar data from  		Florida. </p>
<p>The category of cases covered in our overall study includes fatalities,  		serious nonfatal injuries, and less serious cases. For brevity, the discussion  		in this overview is limited to serious nonfatal injuries, defined  		as brain damage and spinal cord injury and complications. The economic losses  		for the 1,938 cases in this category that do not report exemplary damages  		average $430,225 [see, after the appendices, <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>,  		Panel B, Row b, Column (4). Hereafter references to all such numbered Tables  		will appear in the format 1Bb(4)]. That figure of $430,224 far exceeds  		comparable figures for fatal injuries and less serious nonfatal injuries. </p>
<p>The key to estimating the effect of early offers, as set forth in  		<a href="#itemiv">Item iv</a> of <a href="#section3A">Section 3A</a> above, is  		comparing the amount an insurer sets aside early on to pay a given tort claim  		(called the initial reserve) versus the amount that would be required to pay  		the claimants net economic loss plus attorney fees. If the former is  		greater than the latter, an early offer will likely be made. (The report also  		uses the insurers final reserve and the ultimate payout for such a  		comparison.) The presence of collateral sources will also affect whether an  		early offer is made. </p>
<p>Basing the insurers decision on initial reserves, and assuming  		there is no collateral source offset, of the 1,938 claimants suffering serious  		nonfatal injuries paid under tort law (excluding 521 claims reporting exemplary  		damages in the damages breakdown<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup>), 1,055 (or 54 percent) would be tendered  		early offers under the proposed statute [2Bb(1)]. Such claimants would be paid  		on average 2.37 years (859 days) faster than under tort law [4Bb(1)], with  		total litigation costs reduced by an average of $225,200 per claim [6Bb(1)].  		The savings to insurers from paying such claims would average $578,788 per  		claim [2Bb(1)]. On the debit side, this average payment would reduce payment to  		such claimants by $321,583, with only 2.75 percent of claimants receiving more  		under an early offer than under a tort claim [7Bb(1)]. Claimants may receive  		more under early offers if most of their damages under the current system are  		economic loss, from which one-third is deducted for attorneys fees. These  		figures raise a question: given that early offers cover essential losses with  		far lower payments by insurers (and presumably with a resultant reduction, at  		least in the long run, in medical malpractice premiums), is the greater  		promptitude and certainty of such payments under early offers worthwhile? In  		this connection, note also the effect of deducting payees coverage from  		their own collateral sources on the savings of insurers in calculating whether  		to make an early offer: this effect leads to an average savings of $583,989  		deducting collateral sources [3Bb(1)], versus savings of $578,788 without such  		a deduction [2Bb(1)]. These values are similar because collateral sources  		account for only 20-28 percent of economic damages, which in turn comprise only  		one-third of total damages. Although collateral sources may be available more  		quickly than payment under current tort law, collateral sources provide only a  		small share of total economic loss. </p>
<p>To lessen discrepant payments under early offers compared to payments  		under tort law for those suffering serious nonfatal injuries (or death), a  		provision could be added to an early offer statute requiring that an early  		offer provides a minimum payment, either payment of net economic loss or a  		minimum of $250,000. (Also listed in the report is the effect of minimums of  		$100,000 and $500,000.) The number of claimants suffering serious but nonfatal  		injuries who lose an amount of compensation under the $250,000 option is  		reduced from 1,055 to 498, with the percentage of claimants gaining in  		compensation rising from 2.75 percent to 29.12 percent [7Bb(1) and 7Bf(1)]. On  		the other hand, the number of serious nonfatal injury cases receiving early  		offers would be reduced from 1,055 to 498, with the remaining claimants  		consigned to the current tort claim system [2Bb(1) and 2Bf(1)]. </p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the data from Texas is limited to paid  		claims, and so cannot be used to estimate the number of claims not being paid  		at common law that would be paid under an early offer statute. But such  		payments might be made if just the costs of defending a claim, plus even the  		relatively small risk of an adverse verdict, would exceed the claimants  		net economic loss. The smaller the insurers reserve in any given case,  		the less likely that would seem. But herein lies an important element of the  		report: it indicates the initial (or early) dollar reserve allocated to pay a  		claim are often greatly underestimated compared to a claims ultimate  		value for those claims that are paid. In the connection, the report shows that  		for nonfatal serious injuries, the average initial reserve was $578,209  		[1Bb(1)], compared to an actual settlement/award of $1,257,676 [1Bb(3)]. Note  		further, as stated earlier, that only $430,225 of that average settlement award  		consisted of the claimants economic loss [1Bb(4)], indicating how  		comparatively attractive for insurers early offers will be based on the cost of  		paying only economic loss versus full damages. Because both final reserves and  		ultimate payouts are larger than initial reserves, insurers are more likely to  		make early offers if the decision is based on final reserves and ultimate  		payout. This results in more early offer payees, prompter payment, lower  		litigation costs, and lower overall costs [2Bb(2)(3), 4Bb(3), 6Bb(2)(3), and  		3Bb(2)(3) respectively], as shown by the following lettered Exhibits:</p>

</tr></table><p>Requiring a minimum payment may increase average claimant reductions in  		compensation because the mix of claims affected by early offers changes. Such a  		minimum reduces the number of claims eligible for an early offer (compared to  		paying only net economic losses), with the result that the altered mix of cases  		entails only higher value claims.</p>
<p>The important point here is that the larger the final reserve or payment  		compared to the initial reserve, the greater the incentive for insurers to set  		a more realistic and therefore higher initial reserve, leading in turn to more  		and higher early offers. In this connection, it should be noted that  		insurers final reserve for claims involving serious nonfatal injury  		averages $1,892,127, which is much closer to the average settlement/award of  		$1,257,676 than the average initial reserve of $578,209  		[1Bb(2)(3)(1)].<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> Note  		that insurers currently do not have knowledge of the later reserve or final  		payout at the time they are making the initial reserve. However, if the early  		offer proposal is adopted, insurers would have an incentive to do a more  		refined analysis of a claim at an early stage than they do at present. Even  		without adjusting the initial reserve values to reflect the likely greater  		research that will occur in an early offer regime, the data still seem to  		indicate widespread opportunities for successful early offers.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="building" id="building">4. BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE EARILY OFFER  		PROPOSAL</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section4A" id="section4A">4A. Expected Overall Insurers  		Costs</a></h3>
<p>As indicated, the maximum that an insurer would be willing to offer to  		resolve a claim under the early offer proposal is determined by the  		insurers expected liability and litigation costs of proceeding with the  		claim under normal tort law. This expectation, of course, takes into account  		the probability of settling the claim or losing the case at trial. These  		probabilities are incorporated in the reserve amounts, but since we only have  		data on claims for which there was payment, the payment or settlement amount  		calculations are not weighted by any probabilities. Because insurers get to  		decide whether to make an early offer, we focus on the key value affecting that  		decision, which is the amount the defendant would have expected to pay for the  		claim in the absence of the early offer proposal.</p>
<p>As indicated above, in our calculations we use three different reference  		measurements to estimate the basis for that decision. The first measure is the  		insurers initial reserve amount set aside for possible payment in the  		tort case. The second measure is its final reserve amount set aside for the  		same case. The third measure is the actual amount of the settlement or court  		award in the case, plus associated legal defense expenses. (Note again, the use  		of the second or third measure to decide on the feasibility of an early offer  		assumes greater foresight on the part of the insurer.) The Texas closed claim  		data used here reports initial and final reserve divided into indemnity reserve  		(i.e., reserve for payments) and expense reserve (i.e., reserve for all  		claim-related defense expenses). The expense reserve information allows us to  		consider alternative assumptions about reductions in expected legal defense  		expenses arising out of an early offer. The closed claim data also separately  		reports both total allocated loss expenses and allocated legal  		expenses and administrative expenses assigned to a given case.</p>
<p>Texas requires that insurers submit information on claims with bodily  		injury payments of at least $10,000. Payments over $25,000 are reported on a  		long form, and payments under this amount, but at least for $10,000, are  		reported on a short form.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> The years for which Texas data are available  		to us are 1988-2003. We use data for the years 1988-2002, before Texas modified  		its medical malpractice law in 2003. The supplemental data stems from Florida  		which has two medical malpractice closed claim data sets, the archival data set  		from 1975 to mid-July 1999, and the current data set from mid-July 1999 to  		2003. Until 1997, Florida insurers were required to report all closed claims,  		even those with zero payment. After that time, insurers were only required to  		report claims with a nonzero payout, though there continued to be some  		voluntary reporting of zero claims.</p>
<p>The primary insurer (the principal one in the case) submits the Texas  		closed claim form to the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). The primary  		insurer reports its reserve based on its expected payment, and also reports  		information on its actual payment as well as what any other insurers of  		defendant parties contributed to the settlement or award. This means that the  		reported reserve corresponds to the portion of the claim the primary insurer  		expects to pay while the total settlement or court award pertains to the actual  		full payment of the claim. As an example, suppose there are two insured  		providers defending a medical malpractice case, a doctor and a hospital, and  		suppose the doctors insurer (the primary insurer) paid $250,000 and the  		hospitals insurer paid $100,000. Each insurer would then submit a closed  		claim form to the TDI, reporting both its own payment and the payment by the  		other partys insurer, and would also report the total amount of the  		settlement or court award as $350,000. For 66 percent of the Texas claims, the  		primary insurer paid the full amount of the settlement or court  		award,<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> with the  		remaining 34 percent of the claims reporting that more than one payer  		contributed to the settlement.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>All the insurers involved in any given case should generally find making  		an early offer attractive and consequently join in making an early offer.  		Otherwise any nonofferer is left facing a claimant now seeking both economic  		damages, with no collateral source offset, and noneconomic damages, with this  		case in addition being financed by payment from another insurers early  		offer. Thus we assume that the insurers can be treated as a collective entity  		and that in practice any division of the costs among the insurers will be later  		handled through arbitration. Assuming then that the early offer will be a  		collective venture among the applicable insurers, the pertinent reserve values  		to determine the willingness to pay for the early offer are the projected  		amounts for all insurers, not simply that for the primary insurer. To obtain  		this projection, we scaled up the primary insurer reserve amount by the size of  		the total settlement or award, divided by the payment by the primary insurer  		plus any deductible. In particular, we multiplied the reserve amounts by the  		ratio of the response in the Texas long form closed report claim to question  		12a7 (pertaining to the total final amount of settlement or court award)  		divided by the sum of the values in question 12a1 and 12a2 (pertaining to the  		amounts paid by the primary insurer plus any deductible paid by the insured  		provider) (see <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a> for question 12).</p>
<h3><a name="section4B" id="section4B">4B. Defense Legal Expense</a></h3>
<p>Not all of the defense legal expenses will be saved if an early offer is  		accepted because some costs must be incurred to evaluate the claim preparatory  		to deciding whether to make an early offer. To assess the share of costs that  		would be saved, we adopted an approach that is consistent with the  		proposals projected treatment of a claimants legal fees. Assuming  		the usual claimants attorney legal fee would be one-third of any normal  		tort award or settlement, the presumed early offer proposal payment of 10  		percent of net economic loss as a claimants legal expenses provides  		payment of 10/33 of the otherwise normal contingency fee as a part of the early  		offer. Making a parallel share assumption for insurers, we assume that the  		fraction 10/33 of defense legal expenses will be incurred before the early  		offer is accepted. If the insurer chooses instead to litigate the claim, it  		will incur this 10/33 fraction of defense costs plus the remaining 23/33  		fraction. Thus, by settling a claim based on an early offer, the insurer saves  		the 23/33 fraction of legal expenses. As with reserves, we scale up the primary  		insurer defense legal expenses.</p>
<p>In our calculation of whether an early offer is desirable, the maximum  		an insurer would be willing to offer is the expected tort settlement or award  		plus this 23/33 defense cost share. If the early offer is accepted, the only  		defense costs that count as insurer savings are the 23/33 share  		amount because, as indicated, the other defense costs will already have been  		incurred.</p>
<h3><a name="section4C" id="section4C">4C. Net Economic Loss</a></h3>
<p>Of the 16,437 claims in the Texas Closed Claim data set, 5,733 reported  		a breakdown of the damages into four possible categories: (1) economic damages  		(which, net of collateral sources, are payable under an early offer); (2)  		noneconomic damages (which are not payable under an early offer); (3) exemplary  		damages (the possible presence of which includes cases when an early would more  		likely be declined); and (4) prejudgment interest (which will be largely  		eliminated because of the promptness of early offer payments).<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> For cases in which the  		breakdown of economic damages is included in the Texas data, we use that  		damages amount. For all other cases, we use the average economic damages share  		calculated using the Florida medical malpractice data. In particular, we  		distinguish four different economic damages share values based on injury type  		(fatal/nonfatal) and age (under age 18/18 and over). The economic damages  		shares of the total award are as follows: 0.359, nonfatal &lt;age 18 (i.e.,  		nonfatal for those age 18 or younger); 0.156, nonfatal <u>&gt;</u> age 18;  		0.345, fatal &lt; age 18; 0.246, fatal <u>&gt;</u> age 18. Because age and  		injury type are not reported for the TDI short form claims, we use the same  		economic share for all short form claims of 0.348, calculated as the weighted  		average of the economic damages share for all nonfatal claims.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> Because our interest in the  		early offer plan is to compensate for economic loss, and because the Florida  		data does not report either exemplary (or punitive) damages or prejudgment  		interest as separate categories, we also do not provide imputed noneconomic or  		exemplary damages or prejudgment interest. To provide more information on the  		allocation of damages into the four categories, we report detailed information  		on the distribution of economic damages, noneconomic damages, exemplary  		damages, prejudgment interest, and the total settlement court award in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, Panel C, for the 5,733 claims in which a  		breakdown is reported.</p>
<p>Although the TDI long form allows reports of whether any collateral  		sources were available to the injured party, claimants are not required to  		report such sources to the insurer. Investigation of these data suggests that  		reports of collateral sources were incomplete.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> We therefore imputed the percent of economic  		loss offset by collateral sources under the early offer proposal using the  		Florida medical malpractice data, which provides more complete information on  		collateral sources. For claims with positive economic loss in the Florida data,  		we calculated the share of economic loss that will be offset by collateral  		sources as the sum of the percent of total recovery from the following  		insurance categories: Health, Disability, Workers Compensation,  		Automobile,<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> and  		Medicare. We then translated this percentage into a dollar value based on the  		total economic loss. The average percent collateral offset for the different  		classes of cases is then calculated as the average dollar value of collateral  		offset divided by the total economic loss, calculated for each of the four  		age/fatality categories used to impute economic loss. The specific collateral  		source fractions of economic loss are as follows: 0.249, nonfatal &lt; age 18;  		0.281, nonfatal <u>&gt;</u> age 18; 0.213, fatal &lt; age 18; 0.199, fatal  		<u>&gt;</u> age 18. Because age and injury type are not reported for the TDI  		short form claims, we use the same collateral source offset for all short form  		claims of 0.264, calculated as the average for all nonfatal claims.</p>
<h2><a name="special" id="special">5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND  		MINIMUM PAYMENT</a></h2>
<h3>5A. Exemplary Damages</h3>
<p>Claimants who do not accept an early offer must show that the  		providers conduct was grossly negligent, which is variously but similarly  		defined in several states, in order to collect full tort damages. A useful  		measure of whether claimants would anticipate if this higher legal standard  		could be met, and therefore opt out of the early offer settlement choosing  		instead to litigate, would be whether exemplary damages in the tort settlement  		or court award are reported to the TDI. For purposes of our analysis we assume  		that all claims in which there are such reports of exemplary damages will opt  		out of the early offer and that all claims without exemplary damages will be in  		a position to accept an early offer if one is made.</p>
<p>In practice, some claimants who ultimately might have received exemplary  		damages may choose to accept the early offer, since there is substantial  		uncertainty as to whether such damages will be awarded. Likewise, some  		claimants who ultimately will not receive exemplary damages will choose to  		reject the early offer because they overestimate their chances of receiving  		such damages. Based on these assumptions, we distinguish claims that report  		exemplary damages from those that do not, and we indicate the results under the  		early offer proposal with and without these claims. Only 521 of the 16,437  		claims in Panel A of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> thus involved exemplary  		damages, or about three percent of the claims [1Aa(5), e(5)].</p>
<h3>5B. Minimum Payment for Death or Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Another feature in the proposal arises from the treatment of serious  		tort claims in which economic damages would be small, though noneconomic losses  		substantial. Deaths to children and older people with no or low levels of  		earnings would, for example, tend to produce few economic damages, though the  		nonpecuniary costs to the survivors would of course be large. As a result, we  		explore two alternative approaches to treating serious claims, which we define  		as deaths, amputations, brain injuries, and spinal cord injuries. These were  		the claim categories in the TDI data with the largest amounts of noneconomic  		damages. First, what would the damages be if we valued the claim based on the  		actual net economic damages incurred, and second, what would the damages be if  		we set a floor of $250,000, or alternatively of $100,000 or $500,000, as the  		minimum amount of damages payable in such serious cases?</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">6. FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section6A" id="section6A">6A. Reserve and Awards</a></h3>
<p>We begin by reporting insurers initial and final reserve, the  		total settlement or court award, and claimants economic loss.  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, Panel A, Column 1 reports the average projected  		initial reserve amounts using the multiplication factor described above in  		<a href="#section4A">Section 4A</a>, which scales up the reserve amount to  		reflect total payments by multiple parties. Column 2, <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a> reports average projected final reserve amounts. Column 3,  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports the average total settlement or court  		award actually made for the claim. Column 4 reports average economic loss.  		Column 5 reports the sample size for each row. The difference between Column 3,  		Total Settlement or Court Award, in Panel A of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>  		and Column 4 of that table equals the sum of noneconomic damages, prejudgment  		interest, and, where applicable, exemplary damages. Panel B of  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports the same information as Panel A, except  		that it is by injury type rather than claims report categories. Panel C of  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports the breakdown and distribution of awards  		into these categories for the 5,733 claims reporting such a breakdown. Panel D  		of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports reserve, total settlement or court  		award, and legal expenses for the 66 percent of claims in which the primary  		carrier paid the full amount.</p>
<p>In Panel A of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> (as well as in Panel A of  		the subsequent tables), the rows of the table stratify the sample into four  		groups to show how different types of claims in the TDI data are handled by the  		early offer proposal. It is important to remember that only about one-third of  		the claims report a breakdown of damages into the four possible categories of  		damages, namely, economic damages, noneconomic damages, exemplary damages, and  		prejudgment interest. The largest group is composed of claims that do not  		report the allocation of damages into these four categories. For these claims,  		we impute economic damages using methods discussed above in  		<a href="#section4C">Section 4C</a>. These claims are indicated by the row  		heading Imputed economic damages and appear in Row d of Panel A in  		each of <a href="#table1">Tables 1</a>-7. For those claims that do report the  		breakdown into the four categories of damages, one group is composed of claims  		with exemplary damages as well as other damages. We analyze these exemplary  		damages cases separately as we assume that these claimants will not accept an  		early offer and will go to full-scale litigation. These claims are indicated by  		the row heading Exemplary damages reported and appear in Row a of  		Panel A in each of <a href="#table1">Tables 1</a>-7.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> The next group is composed of claims for  		which neither exemplary damages nor economic damages were reported. For these  		claims, all damages amounts paid by the insurer were noneconomic and/or  		prejudgment interest. These claims are indicated by the row heading No  		exemplary damages, economic damages reported as zero and appear in Row b  		of Panel A in each of <a href="#table1">Tables 1</a>-7. Thus, under an early  		offer proposal that pays economic damages only, claimants with zero economic  		damages would receive zero payments. We analyze these claims separately  		because, first, these claims will be most affected by a minimum payment  		requirement in the early offer proposal, and second, without a minimum payment,  		such claimants gain nothing from the early offer and will have the most  		incentive to pursue litigation. The final group is composed of claims with  		positive economic loss reported. Such claims typically also report noneconomic  		loss and/or prejudgment interest. These claims are indicated by the row heading  		No exemplary damages, positive economic damages reported and appear  		in Row c of Panel A in each of <a href="#table1">Tables 1</a>-7.</p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, Row a consists of the 521 cases for which  		exemplary damages are reported. As is apparent, these cases involve the largest  		stakes of any of the subsamples in the table. Row b pertains to the 645 cases  		in which there were both no exemplary damages nor reported economic damages.  		For example, there might be only damages for pain and suffering. Granted these  		cases would all receive zero payment under an early offer approach with no  		payment minimum, but with a payment minimum of $100,000, $250,000 or $500,000,  		all of these cases will be compensated. Row c consists of the 4,567 cases in  		which there were no mention of exemplary damages, but economic damages were  		reported. Row d reports the cases for which there is no damages breakdown but  		for which we imputed the economic damages share using the imputation procedure  		employing the Florida data discussed in <a href="#section4C">Section 4C</a>.  		Row e reports the pooled set of results for all claims.</p>
<p>Several patterns are noteworthy. The exemplary damages cases in Row a  		have the highest values for every reserve or loss value in the table. The other  		entries tend to be more similar in terms of reserve and award values, with the  		largest amounts being for cases in Row c for which positive economic damages  		are reported. For every row in the table, the projected initial reserves in  		Column 1 are below the total settlements or court awards in Column 3, which in  		turn are smaller than the projected final reserve in Column 2. But one thing to  		note is that the reserve amounts in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> include  		defense expense reserves, which are mainly legal expenses, in addition to  		indemnity reserves, whereas the settlement or court award values in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> do not take such expenses into account. These  		expenses will be considered in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p>It may be puzzling that the initial reserves are so much lower than the  		final reserve, but there are several possible explanations of this difference.  		The fact that initial reserves are well below final reserves does not  		necessarily imply that insurers are under-reserving on average with their  		initial reserve amounts, though that may well be the case as indicated in  		scholarly literature.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup>  		The cases observed in the data set are the successful claims that led to  		insurer payouts. If, for example, the insurer reserves the same amount for  		claims of a particular type with this amount corresponding to the average claim  		costs, then the claims that are ultimately successful will be under-reserved  		initially, while the unsuccessful claims will exhibit over-reserving. Thus, the  		selection of claims for inclusion in the data set could alone account for the  		observed pattern without any bias in the reserving practices. Moreover, as the  		claim matures, the insurer will learn more about the claim, distinguishing  		which claims in this overall claims category are those with the highest  		expected losses.</p>
<p>Even apart from that, however, an expert claims manager at a major  		medical malpractice insurer confirms the scholarly literature mentioned above;  		namely, that initial under-reserving is generally pervasive in this field.  		Indeed he thinks it the leading cause of financial failure among medical  		malpractice insurers. To that extent, it should be noted here that a crucial  		element of the early offer plan is that it provides insurers with much more  		incentive than they now have to reserve more realistically very early on (i.e.,  		within 180 days). Indeed, today defendants have an incentive to delay the whole  		process, thereby hoping to weaken the bargaining power of needy claimants.</p>
<p>Panel B of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports information by nature  		of injury, excluding claims reporting exemplary damages because, as indicated,  		we assume such claims will most likely lead to claimants opting out of an  		early offer. Information on the nature of injury is reported on the Texas long  		form and enables us to distinguish fatalities and serious nonfatal injuries  		(brain damage, spinal cord injury, amputation) from other nonfatal injuries.  		Overall, 47 percent of the cases for which the injury type is given are either  		death or serious nonfatal injuries.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> The Texas short form does not record the  		nature of the injury. Because claims reported on the short form represent  		damage payments under $25,000, it is probable that these claims do not  		represent cases with death or other serious injury, and so these claims are  		grouped with nonfatal, nonserious injuries in the table.</p>
<p>In each instance the column headings for Panel B, <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> are the same as Panel A of <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a>, but the rows are different. Row a in Panel B provides information for  		all fatality claims, Row b for the serious nonfatal claims, and Row c for all  		other nonfatal injuries and short form claims. Row d provides values for all  		claims excluding those with exemplary damages. In terms of empirical  		magnitudes, the serious nonfatal injuries in Row b of Panel B involve the  		largest reserve amounts and settlement or award amounts. Indeed, this is the  		only category for which the average settlement or court award is above $1  		million. The average economic loss for this category remains substantial but is  		well under $500,000.</p>
<p>Panel C of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> reports the 10th, 25th, 50th,  		75th, and 90th percentiles of the distribution of total damages and the damages  		components, as well as the mean and standard deviation of each category of  		damages for the 5,733 cases for which the breakdown is provided. For the  		average settlement or court award of $592,316, most is for noneconomic damages  		with an average of $344,875, with economic damages of $181,330 on average.  		Exemplary damages and prejudgment interest together account for a combined  		share of only slightly over 10 percent of the total settlement award.</p>
<p>The skewed nature of the damages distribution is evident from the  		results in Panel C. For economic damages, the mean value of $181,330 is almost  		six times larger than the median value of $33,021, which is shown at the 50th  		percentile, indicating the substantial influence of some unusually large claims  		on the mean. For example, the total economic damages value at the 90th  		percentile is $396,256. The datas broad damages variability is further  		reflected in the large value of the standard deviation of $613,140 for economic  		damages shown in the bottom row of Panel C, <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. This  		variability in turn is consistent with the certainty provided by early offers  		being attractive to risk-averse plaintiffs. The patterns of high variability  		exhibited by the noneconomic damages distribution and that of total settlements  		and awards are similar.</p>
<p>Exemplary damages and prejudgment interest are zero for most cases, but  		are significant when they do come into play. At the 90th percentile the value  		of exemplary damages is zero, but the overall mean is $41,579, indicating that  		a small number of cases have substantial exemplary damages. Similarly,  		prejudgment interest has a value of zero through the 75th percentile, with a  		90th percentile value of $34,711 and a mean value of $24,533. In other words,  		for most cases neither exemplary damages nor prejudgment interest come into  		play, but the average effect over all cases does matter.</p>
<p>Panel D of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> provides the counterpart of  		Panel A for the claims paid entirely by the carrier. Thus, for these claims the  		complications raised by multiple parties do not arise. Focusing on these claims  		indicates that for claims for which exemplary damages are reported, final  		reserve are very similar to the value of the settlement or court award.  		However, for all claims combined the initial reserve is less than half of the  		total settlement or court award, while the final reserve is about one-third  		greater than the actual settlement or award.</p>
<h3><a name="section6B" id="section6B">6B. Early Offer Outcomes Without  		Collateral Source Offset</a></h3>
<p>At the outset it should be noted that <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> (and all subsequent tables) concern cases where  		an early offer will be made, whereas <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> concerns all  		cases where tort payment was made. <a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a> provides  		an example of the calculations for the values reported in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> (and all  		subsequent tables), as these numbers cannot be derived from <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. With that in mind, as indicated earlier, whether  		insurers will choose to make an early offer and how much they will save  		relative to the current medical malpractice regime depends on the maximum  		amounts that they would be willing to offer under the present tort regime minus  		the amounts that they would have to pay under the early offer regime. We refer  		to these amounts as the insurer savings stemming from the early  		offer plan, meaning that compared to the current system, the early offer  		proposal will save insurers these amounts. (But, as discussed below, insurer  		savings do not equal the reduced amount of payments to claimants.) These  		results are reported in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, where the results in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>  		do not deduct collateral sources to calculate economic damages, and the results  		in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> make this deduction in order to calculate net  		economic loss. The columns in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> report insurer savings calculated from different  		assumptions about the insurers expected costs. In Column 1 of each table,  		the insurer savings are calculated using projected initial indemnity (i.e.,  		damages) reserve; in Column 2 the insurer savings are calculated using  		projected final indemnity reserve, and in Column 3 the insurer savings are  		calculated using the actual total settlement or court award. In calculating  		economic loss plus legal fees, we assume, as pointed out above, that the early  		offer plan sets legal fees of the claimant, as a surrogate for a reasonable  		fee, at 10 percent of the value of the tendered economic loss. Thus, the legal  		fee payment is in addition to economic loss rather than being deducted from the  		loss payment as is done under the current tort regime. <a href="#table2">Table  		2</a> reports the average insurer savings when they are positive (or zero)  		based on the following calculations:</p>
<blockquote><p>Column (1), Rows a - d:<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup>Insurer Savings = Projected (initial  		  indemnity reserve + 23/33 initial expense reserve)  1.1 economic  		  loss.</p>
<p>Column (2), Rows a - d: Insurer Savings = Projected (final  		  indemnity reserve + 23/33 final expense reserve)  1.1 economic loss.</p>
<p>Column (3), Rows a - d: Insurer Savings = Total settlement or  		  court award + 23/33 total allocated loss adjustment expenses  1.1  		  economic loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> reports the corresponding insurer savings  		replacing economic loss with net economic loss,  		calculated as economic loss minus the collateral source offset. We also  		calculate these insurer savings based on the assumption of a minimum payment of  		$100,000, $250,000 or $500,000 for fatalities and serious nonfatal injuries,  		with these values reported in Rows e-h of Panel B in <a href="#table2">Table  		2</a> and <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, the  		bracketed values refer to sample size, and the dollar numbers in each entry  		correspond to the average insurer savings under the early offer plan for the  		category conditional on it being desirable for the insurer to make an early  		offer. For example, in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, Panel A, the entry in Row  		c, Column 1 indicates that based on the initial reserve, it is desirable for  		the insurer to make an early offer in 2,753 of the 4,567 cases in this category  		(claims with no exemplary damages reporting positive economic damages). If the  		claimants were to accept, the average insurer savings compared to the current  		medical malpractice payout would be $325,973 based on the initial reserve. The  		counterpart deducting collateral sources is reported in <a href="#table3">Table  		3</a> with the entry in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, Panel A, Row c, Column 1  		indicating that deducting collateral sources increases the number of claims in  		which an early offer based on the initial reserve would be attractive for  		insurers to 3,034 claims, with the average insurer savings from the early offer  		dropping slightly to $323,824. This decline in the average savings occurs  		despite the inclusion of a collateral source offset because of the expanded  		number of claims for which an early offer would be made. Note that the insurer  		savings reported in Row b of both <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> and  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> are identical because this row reports claims  		with zero economic damages and so there is no collateral source offset.</p>
<p>Row e in Panel A of <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> provides a summary of  		statistics for all claims. Out of the 16,437 claims, making an early offer is  		desirable for 11,383 claims based on the initial reserve amount, for 15,895  		claims based on the final reserve amount, and for 16,409 claims based on the  		actual award or settlement. The greatest insurer savings are for the projected  		final reserve approach, where for the claims in which an offer is desirable the  		average insurer savings is $549,871.</p>
<p>Panel B of <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> provides information for the  		same columns of early offer scenarios by nature of injury, excluding claims  		reporting exemplary damage, but including a variant of the analysis in which  		there is a minimum payment of $100,000, $250,000, or $500,000 for death or  		serious injury. The effect of the minimum payment on the desirability of making  		an early offer is substantial. For the fatalities, based on the initial reserve  		amount, which is reflected in Row a and Column 1 of Panel B of  		<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, an early offer is desirable for 3,074 cases out  		of the 4,609 fatalities. But as the results in Row e indicate, with a $250,000  		minimum an early offer is attractive to insurers in fewer cases -- 1,124.  		Lowering the minimum payment to $100,000 raises the number of claims for which  		an early offer is attractive to insurers to 2,036 claims (reported in Row g,  		Column 1.) Much the same pattern is observed for serious nonfatal injuries in  		Row f, with the early offer based on the projected initial reserve attractive  		in 498 cases compared to the Row b number of 1,055 when there is no $250,000  		minimum, and 808 claims with a minimum of $100,000. Interestingly, the  		imposition of the minimum payment increases the average savings per case. That  		seemingly paradoxical result can be traced to the change in the mix of claims  		for which an early offer is desirable. As the minimum payment amount is  		increased, it is desirable for insurers to make an early offer for fewer  		claims. Once a $250,000 or even a $100,000 minimum is imposed, it is only the  		very high stakes claims for which the insurer will find an early offer  		attractive. Raising the payment minimum consequently reduces the number of  		claims in which an early offer will be made but increases the average savings  		for this altered mix of cases. These are the claims that have a large level of  		noneconomic damages, while under the early offer regime the insurer only pays  		net economic damages, subject to a minimum, plus an allowance for attorney  		fees. (The same phenomenon applies to the effect of minimum payments on  		claimant losses recorded in <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>).</p>
<h3>6C. Collateral Sources</h3>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> repeats the analysis of <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> deducting imputed collateral sources from economic  		loss. Naturally enough, the early offer proposal will be attractive to insurers  		more often when collateral sources are offset from economic loss. But although  		collateral sources offset about 25 percent of economic loss, the effects are  		generally similar to the <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> findings, with the  		largest increase in savings occurring when insurers are basing the  		attractiveness of the claim on final reserves.</p>
<h3>6D. Time Saved</h3>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> and <a href="#table5">Table 5</a> report  		time saved by acceptance of the early offer proposal under the assumption that  		offers will be made and accepted in 180 days. Claimants will obviously benefit  		from quicker payment. The early offer proposal will expedite payments by about  		two years, and for some categories such as that shown in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>, Panel B, Row f for serious nonfatal injury (where  		prompt payment is especially needed), the payment is expedited by about two and  		a half years.</p>
<h3>6E. Litigation Cost Savings</h3>
<p>The main quantifiable gain in efficiency from the early offer proposal  		is the savings in litigation costs. There are of course other efficiency gains  		that are more difficult to assess, such as the benefit of reduced payment  		uncertainty. As discussed in <a href="#section4B">Section 4B</a>, for insurers  		we estimate the litigation cost savings based on the fraction 23/33 of the  		reserve for legal expenses or actual legal expenses, depending on whether the  		calculations in <a href="#table6">Table 6</a> are based on reserves (Columns 1  		and 2) or actual expenditures (Column 3). The initial reserve for legal  		expenses does not account for the fact that incurring these expenses will not  		be immediate. We convert these estimates to a present value (PV) assuming a 3  		percent interest rate and a time period equal to the time period savings under  		the early offer proposal. For the other litigation cost estimates, we assume  		that no discounting is needed. In all cases, for claimants we estimate the  		litigation cost savings as 0.23 of what the total settlement or award would  		have been in the absence of the early offer proposal.</p>
<p>The specific equations used to calculate litigation cost savings  		reported in <a href="#table7">Table 7</a> are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Column (1), Rows a - d: Litigation cost savings = 0.23* Total  		  settlement or court award + PV(23/33* initial expense reserve)</p>
<p>Column (2), Rows a - d: Litigation cost savings = 0.23* Total  		  settlement or court award + 23/33* final expense reserve</p>
<p>Column (3), Rows a - d: Litigation cost savings = 0.23* Total  		  settlement or court award + 23/33* attorney expenses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the estimates in <a href="#table6">Table 6</a> indicate, the  		litigation cost savings are substantial, as these average savings are over  		$100,000 per claim for every category in Panel A of <a href="#table6">Table  		6</a>, except for one of the estimates based on the initial reserve amount. As  		the analogous distribution in Panel B of <a href="#table6">Table 6</a>  		indicates, the cases for which the litigation cost savings are under $100,000  		are for the nonfatal injuries that are not serious (as defined in  		<a href="#section4A">Section 4A</a>) and claims reported on the short form  		(which are for claims under $25,000). Even this category for less serious  		claims in Row c of Panel B in <a href="#table6">Table 6</a> has average  		litigation cost savings ranging from $50,085 to $108,737.</p>
<h3>6F. Gains or Losses to Claimants</h3>
<p>The effect of different early offer proposal structures on different  		categories of claims can be assessed as well. Under the current tort system we  		assume that claimants receive two-thirds of the total settlement or award, with  		the remaining one-third going to attorney fees. The early offer plan  		compensates claimants for net economic damages, which must in turn be inflated  		to account for their quicker payment, which, as indicated, we do using a 3  		percent interest rate.</p>
<p><a href="#table7">Table 7</a> indicates the effect of early offers on  		claimants in terms of the average net gain or loss in dollars paid. Each cell  		also provides in parentheses the percentage of claimants in each group who will  		gain from the early offer approach. Consider the effect on all claims in Row e  		of Panel A in <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>. The percentage of claimants who  		gain in dollar payout is 4 percent or less, with an average loss of  		$134,601-$161,663, but the results in Panel B of <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>  		indicate that the imposition of a minimum payment amount can substantially  		increase the percentage of claimants who benefit. The percentage of cases  		involving a fatal injury that would be better off under the early offer  		proposal is as high as 45 percent for a $250,000 minimum and 59 percent for a  		$500,000 minimum.</p>
<h2><a name="number" id="number">7. EFFECTS ON THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND  		DETERRENCE</a></h2>
<p>An important question is whether more or fewer claims will be paid under  		an early offers regime. We are not able to answer this question, in part  		because the Texas data are limited to paid claims, so we do not have a basis  		for analyzing the number of claims unpaid at common law that are likely to be  		payable by early offers. In this section we discuss some of the issues that  		affect the number of claims under early offers relative to the number of claims  		under the current tort regime.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of defendants incentives, compared to present  		system the early offer regime will reduce the costs of settling a claim,  		including defense costs. Claimants will also be more willing to settle than  		under the present regime so that in terms of the theoretical structure of the  		settlement process, settlement of any given claim should be more likely than at  		present.</p>
<p>But a premise of the early offer regime is that defendants are not  		required to make an offer in any claim, including for claims not likely to be  		paid now. Data other than our own indicate that some 60 percent of medical  		malpractice claims now brought are closed without payment.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> Our sample shows that 31  		percent of all claims now being paid will not lead insurers to make an early  		offer based on the analysis using initial reserves [2Ae(1); 11,383/16,437 =  		69%]. If early offers are calculated on the basis of final reserves or actual  		payout, the percentage of claims now paid that would also be paid under early  		offers rises to 98 percent and almost 100 percent respectively [2Ae(2)(3)].</p>
<p>A key factor that will affect the attractiveness of making early offers  		would be high defense costs, especially for serious nonfatal injuries  		[6Bb(1)-(3)], as discussed in <a href="#section3B">Section 3B</a>. If any claim  		is serious enough that defense costs, coupled with even a relatively small risk  		of an adverse verdict, exceed the claimants net economic loss, an early  		offer might be forthcoming. But insurers may be reluctant to make offers based  		primarily on avoiding defense costs because that may affect their bargaining  		position for other claims. On the other hand, two informal estimates by medical  		malpractice defense counsel, one in a big firm, the other in a small one,  		indicate they would be inclined to recommend early offers in about 80 percent  		of the cases they were currently defending.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>From the claimants perspective, any claim not likely to have been  		initiated prior to the early offer regime where the claimants attorney  		received a one-third share of a full award will probably not become more  		attractive when the payment of legal fees is limited to 10 percent of only the  		economic loss. The main offsetting influence is that payments to attorneys will  		be more immediate and entail less work.</p>
<p>On this subject of more claims under early offers, it is important to  		emphasize that a key premise of an early offer regime is to make better use of  		medical malpractice dollars now being expended, not to increase them. This is  		based on the perception that medical malpractice costs are already high.  		Although others often call for higher premiums in order to pay the many smaller  		claims not now being pursued due to high litigation costs,<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> that is a much vaster social  		undertaking than the early offer proposal entails.</p>
<p>The issue of more -- or fewer -- claims, along with reduced costs,  		raises the question of more or less deterrence of unsafe delivery of health  		care under an early offer regime. In the first place there is currently no  		consensus regarding whether the present medical malpractice regime effectively  		deters lapses by health care providers.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> At least the early offer approach will be an  		improvement on the present system in providing timely and certain compensation  		with lower litigation costs, goals much more readily accomplished than improved  		deterrence. But incentives for responsible care will be provided as long as  		there is substantial internalization of the costs of medical mistakes. The  		certainty and greater promptitude of these internalizing payments under early  		offers will also enhance deterrence compared to the current system in that  		deterrence to be effective must be swift and certain.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">8. CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>This report has analyzed the quantifiable effects of the early offer  		reform of medical malpractice liability insurance. This approach will greatly  		reduce insurer costs, provide payments to injured patients much more  		effectively and quickly, and lower transaction costs.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> The report has analyzed the effect of a  		particular early offer proposal under three different assumptions regarding its  		expected costs based on insurers initial reserve, final reserve, and  		actual awards or settlements. We explored the effect of subtracting collateral  		payments or not, as well as the introduction of different minimum payments  		ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 for fatalities and serious injuries. These  		differences influence the net gains or losses of the parties, with these  		effects varying by injury type. Because of the substantial role played by  		noneconomic damages, insurers usually reap greater net financial benefits than  		do claimants. But claimants with serious injuries and great financial need, for  		whom any insurance mechanism should be particularly concerned, may prefer the  		early offer payment, particularly, but not only, if there is a high minimum  		payment. In this connection, note that the level of collateral sources  		available to claimants is relatively low, as shown in <a href="#table3">Table  		3</a>, Panel B compared to <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, Panel B, (both in  		<a href="#section6A">Section 6A</a> above). This indicates how few financial  		resources claimants typically have while waiting for any tort payment. Indeed,  		for all early offer payees, in contrast to tort law receipt of compensation  		occurs almost two years earlier on average. For all injury categories and all  		the variants referred to above, there are also savings in both overall insurer  		costs and litigation costs averaging hundreds of thousands of dollars per case.  		Such savings in turn will reduce medical malpractice insurance premiums in the  		long run.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup></p>

<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Note</a> also that we use standard statistical terms  			 throughout this report.

Percentiles are  			 values that indicate how many data values are below and how many are above the  			 given percentile value. For example, 30 percent of the data values lie below  			 the 30th percentile, and 70 percent of the data values lie above the 30th  			 percentile. The median, which is equivalent to the 50th percentile, is the  			 value at which half the data values are larger than the median and half are  			 smaller than the median.

Because injury type is not reported on the short form, we  			 group short form claims in the early offer analysis with nondeath, nonserious  			 injuries. Given the indemnity cap of $25,000 for short form reports, the  			 injuries are unlikely to be death or serious injury.</font></td>

<td><font>8a - 8f</font></td>
<td><font>Primary carriers reported  			 initial and final reserves for indemnity and expenses corresponding to their  			 payment reported in question 12a1. As reported in the 2002 Annual Report (p.  			 11), some insurers included expense reserves with indemnity reserves. This  			 means that total reserves reported in 8c and 8f may be more reliable than the  			 components reported in 8a, 8b, 8d, and 8e. For cases in which primary  			 carrier reports zero payment in 12a1, reserves correspond to payment reported  			 in 12a2. For cases involving a self-insured entity, reserves correspond to the  			 sum of 12a1 and 12a2. Per conversation with TDI staff, the relevant  			 comparison of reserves in 8a - 8f is to the sum of 12a1 and 12a2 for all  			 claims.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Attorney  			 employed</font></td>
<td><font>9</font></td>
<td><font>Attorneys were employed  			 by the plaintiff in 98 percent of the claims and by the insurer in 94 percent  			 of the claims. For simplicity, we assume all claims will employ an  			 attorney.</font></td>

</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Damage  			 components</font></td>
<td><font>11b2 a - e, 11d3 a - e,  			 11e3 a - e</font></td>
<td><font>For some claims, total  			 damage amounts are reported in four components: economic losses, noneconomic  			 losses, exemplary damages, and prejudgment interest. Claims settled by court  			 verdict or settled after a court verdict are required to report this breakdown.  			 Claims settled out of court report the breakdown only if, in the opinion of the  			 individual completing the form, the settlement was influenced by a demand for  			 or possible award of noneconomic, exemplary damages, or prejudgment interest.  			 For these amounts, we use the TDI calculated variables reported in  			 Columns 184 - 188, labeled ECONOMIC, NONECO, EXEMP, and INTEREST. For  			 claims not reporting the breakdown, we use Florida data to impute economic loss  			 as a fraction of the total court award or settlement amount. The fractions are  			 as follows: 0.359, nonfatal &lt;age 18; 0.156, nonfatal &gt; age 18; 0.345,  			 fatal &lt; age 18; 0.246, fatal &gt; age 18. Because age and injury type are  			 not reported for short form claims, we use the same economic share for all  			 short form claims of 0.348, calculated as the weighted average for all nonfatal  			 claims. The average are based on numbers reported in Table 5A and Table 5B of  			 the Phase I report.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Payments</font></td>
<td><font>12a1 - 7</font></td>
<td><font>Payments are reported by  			 the primary carrier and are reported as amount paid by primary carrier (12a1);  			 amount paid by the insured, due to deductible (12a2); amount paid by excess  			 carrier (12a3); amount paid by the insured due to settlement or award in excess  			 of policy limits (12a4); amount paid by other insurers on behalf of other  			 defendants (12a5); amount paid by other defendants that were not insured  			 (12a6). The total amount of settlement or court award is reported in 12a7 and  			 is the sum of the numbers reported in 12a1 - 12a6. As reported in the  			 2002 Annual Report (p. 3 - 4), the total settlement amount may be incomplete  			 because carriers report only known settlement amounts paid to the claimant.  			 Specifically, p. 4 states: Reports indicating involvement of other  			 contributing parties may not have included the other contributing parties  			 payments in the total settlement amount. Respondents were asked to  			 indicate unknown when they did not know amount paid by other  			 parties. As an example, our calculations show that the amount paid by other  			 insurers on behalf of other defendants was reported as unknown for  			 460 claims, and the corresponding dollar amount was recorded as  			 zero.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Collateral  			 sources</font></td>
<td><font>14a, b, c1 - c6, long  			 form only</font></td>
<td><font>The form asked whether  			 workers compensation was available to the injured party (14a); whether  			 the respondent was aware of any other collateral sources available to the  			 injured party (14b); and for those indicating yes to 14b, to select those  			 sources that were available from a list of collateral sources (medical  			 insurance; disability insurance; social security disability/ supplementary  			 security benefits; Medicare, Medicaid; sick leave; other). The values of these  			 collateral sources are not reported. Furthermore, as reported in the 2002  			 Annual Report (p. 6), claimants were not required to make collateral source  			 information available to insurers, so the data may not report all cases when  			 collateral sources were available, leading to a lower than accurate value of  			 the role of collateral sources. We therefore impute collateral sources  			 offset using Florida data reporting percentage payments for corresponding  			 collateral source categories and stratified by age and fatality. We calculate  			 the share of economic loss offset by each of the five collateral sources  			 reported in the data, then calculate the dollar value that applies to each  			 claim, then take the average in each of the four categories. The collateral  			 source offsets are as follows: 0.249, nonfatal &lt; age 18; 0.281, nonfatal  			 <u>&gt;</u> age 18; 0.213, fatal &lt; age 18; 0.199, fatal <u>&gt;</u> age 18.  			 Because age and injury type are not reported for short form claims, we use the  			 same collateral source offset for all short form claims of 0.264, calculated as  			 the weighted average for all nonfatal claims. We examine the  			 comprehensiveness of the collateral source reporting in Texas and magnitude of  			 possible underreporting by matching percentage payment reported in the Florida  			 data to the presence of collateral sources reported in the Texas data. The  			 categories reported in both the Texas data and the Florida data are  			 Medicare/Medicaid, health insurance, and workers compensation. If the  			 claimant in the Texas data had such coverage we assigned the percentage payment  			 reported in the Florida data. The resulting average collateral source offset  			 would be only 4.8 percent, a number far lower than calculated using the FL  			 data. See note 5 above.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Legal  			 expenses</font></td>
<td><font>17a - 17d</font></td>
<td><font>The amount paid to  			 outside defense counsel is reported in 17a, allocated expense for in-house  			 counsel is reported in 17b, allocated loss adjustment expenses such as court  			 costs and stenographers are reported in 17c, with the total allocated loss  			 adjustment expense reported in 17d. As reported in the 2002 Annual TDI Report  			 (p. 7), cost containment expenses are not reported on the closed claim forms  			 and so the expenses incurred to settle the claim are understated.</font></td>
