<p>The authors would like to thank the many people who contributed to this  		monograph. First, we thank John Hoff, former Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office  		of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy, who saw the need for and took  		the lead in setting the goals of this study, as well as project officer Linda  		Bergofsky, who contributed throughout the project, including participation in  		one site visit and two annual meetings of the Federation of State Medical  		Boards.</p>
<p>Second, we thank the knowledgeable and helpful members of the  		projects Technical Advisory Group (TAG) (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#appendA">Appendix  		A</a>). Before case studies began, they helped shape the issues addressed and  		overall approach taken, as shown in the concept paper (Bovbjerg and Stockdale  		2004). Third, we thank Lisa Robin of the Federation, who served on the TAG and  		provided automated access to the Federations <i>Exchange</i> data (FSMB  		2003b), which provides detailed information about Boards that facilitated case  		study site selection and contributed to this report. The Federation  		subsequently also provided access to their most recent member board survey,  		which has much useful data on Board operations.</p>
<p>Fourth, our special thanks go to the many state officials and others in  		each case study state that granted us substantial amounts of their time--in  		many instances during multiple sessions--and supplied numerous documents. Their  		generous contributions of time, energy, and information made this project  		feasible. Reasons of confidentiality as well as numbers preclude their being  		listed by name here. Finally, we thank our colleagues--Holly S. Stockdale, who  		worked on this project until October 2004; Barbara Ormond and Timothy S. Jost,  		who reviewed and contributed to the manuscript; and Timothy Waidman, who has  		managed this and other ASPE projects within the Urban Institutes Health  		Policy Center.</p>
<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>State Medical Boards that license and discipline physicians play an  		important and insufficiently studied role in medical quality assurance. This  		project gathered information on Boards structures, processes for  		disciplining physicians, especially those relevant to improving medical  		quality, and methods of self-assessment. The project also identified practices  		that state Medical Board staff or other experts believe effective or  		potentially effective in improving their processes or impacts on quality.</p>
<p><b>Data collection</b>. Issues of interest were framed by the project  		statement of work and elaborated through literature review, national expert  		discussions, input from a technical advisory group, and production of a concept  		paper (Bovbjerg &amp; Stockdale 2004). Information on Board structure and  		operations came from detailed case study interactions in six states during  		2004-05. Descriptive analysis of cross-state structural and performance data  		was possible based on case study results and national data on Boards for 2003,  		the most recent available, from the Federation of State Medical Boards, and  		current licensure requirements came from the compilation of the American  		Medical Association. </p>
<p>Case studies were conducted in six states: California, Iowa,  		Massachusetts, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington. They were chosen to include  		innovations of interest and for reputations of good administration, as well as  		for some diversity in size and geographic location. Available documentation on  		Boards was obtained; and open-ended sessions were conducted with physician and  		non-physician Board members, executive directors and other managers, staff, and  		outside observers or participants in Board activities. The project focused on  		current experience, defined as about the last five years, but key informants  		also referred to prior history.</p>
<p><b>Board Structure and Resources</b>. Literature suggests that the  		following factors influence disciplinary performance.</p>
<ul><li>Some Boards are part of a larger umbrella state agency  		  while others operate more independently. </li>
<li>Board membership always has a physician majority, but nearly half may  		  be public members. </li>
<li>Board powers and operations are influenced by specific state enabling  		  legislation, the states law of administrative procedure, and judicial  		  rulings. </li>
<li>Boards spending per thousand physicians ranges widely, affected  		  by licensure fee levels and state budgetary policies. All six study Boards were  		  in the middle half of budgetary resources nationally in 2003, but the highest  		  state studied still had almost double the funding of the lowest.</li>
</ul><p><b>Complaint Resolution</b>. Discipline of physicians beyond initial  		licensure is the Boards main activity. Discipline is largely  		complaint-driven, and Boards proactively begin few cases.</p>
<ul><li>Some 60-90% of complaints came from the public in the study states,  		  almost entirely from patients and families. Boards also receive input from  		  other government agencies, hospitals, and malpractice insurers. </li>
<li>Many complaints at least in part involve allegations of poor quality  		  care--a quarter to half of them, according to executive directors. </li>
<li>The volume of complaints per thousand physicians varies considerably  		  by state, in part because of differing standards of what constitutes a  		  complaint. </li>
</ul><p>Complaint resolution proceeds through four main stages: intake,  		investigation, pre-hearing preparations, and hearing. Intake resolves about 14%  		of cases before investigation, largely because they are minor or complain about  		unregulated behavior, such as physicians charges. Investigation closes  		almost two-thirds of cases, typically because there is too little evidence to  		support formal charges but sometimes with an informal notice of concern or  		similar communication with the respondent physician. Pre-hearing processes  		resolve almost 20% of cases, either dropping them after further consideration  		by staff and prosecuting attorneys or settling them by agreement with the  		respondent. Only about 1.5% of complaints reach formal hearing. </p>
<p>A final level of process is court appeal after final Board decision.  		Physicians whose hearing imposed strong sanctions not infrequently appeal,  		according to case study informants, but appeals constitute a very small share  		of total disciplinary cases because hearings are so uncommon. In all, almost 5%  		of complaints result in some level of sanction, which may be negotiated before  		hearing or imposed after one. Most Boards have authority to take a full range  		of actions to resolve a complaint. Actions may be informal, such as a  		confidential letter of education or censure. The most prejudicial  		formal actions are loss or restriction of license. Other prejudicial actions  		include fines and reprimands. Some actions are classified as non-prejudicial,  		often unrelated to sanctions, such as reinstatement of license. Most cases are  		closed without any action. </p>
<p><b>Measuring Disciplinary Performance</b>. A key question posed in all  		case study sites was what outputs Board managers intended to achieve and how  		they measured them. Only two performance measures were noted in all sites. The  		first was the number of disciplinary sanctions imposed. The second was  		timeliness of complaint resolution--and avoidance of a lengthy backlog of open  		cases.</p>
<ul><li>The annual rate of prejudicial actions per thousand practicing  		  physicians is not high. Nationally, the average is just under six actions per  		  thousand physicians per year, just under seven in the study states, with  		  substantial variation across states. </li>
<li>The speed of complaint resolution also varies greatly. For instance,  		  in the typical state only about 10% of cases take more than 360 days to  		  resolve. However, such slow closures constituted 60% or more of closures for  		  about one-fifth of reporting Boards nationally. </li>
<li>All the study states reported having to address significant backlogs  		  of complaints in some recent period.</li>
</ul><p><b>Impediments to Disciplinary Performance in Practice</b>. Board  		members and managers described facing different challenges at different stages  		of the disciplinary process. At intake, a key issue is conducting reliable  		triage to set priorities for investigation. During investigation, Board staff  		must overcome barriers to obtaining medical records from physicians, their own  		understaffing, and problems discerning whether quality cases were serious  		enough to receive high priority. Difficulties obtaining sufficient medical and  		legal expertise were especially problematic. They apply both at screening  		stages, as Board staff must prioritize investigations or decide whether to  		charge and prosecute a physician and in preparing for and conducting formal  		testimony at hearing.</p>
<p>High costs were endemic at all stages, particularly for quality-based  		cases--starting with the need for early medical screening, more in preparation  		for hearing, and most of all in fully contested hearings. Where possible,  		Boards often resolve quality-related concerns against a practitioner by finding  		an easier-to-prove ground, such as failure to report required information in  		renewing his or her license. Boards do not track costs by function, but  		executive directors could provide an approximation of their costs for a recent  		fully contested quality case that had necessitated expert testimony. Three of  		the six said such a case had cost $100,000. Costs are high for going to hearing  		rather than settling because revoking a license requires proof through expert  		testimony of a continuing pattern of negligence or lack of competence. Board  		members and managers described wrestling with determinations of just how many  		instances of negligence are needed to demonstrate incompetence. They confirmed  		that are no agreed upon, objective standards of competence on which they can  		rely.</p>
<p>Systemic problems of fragmentation of responsibilities and  		discontinuities in the disciplinary process were also described. There are  		typically multiple hand offs among staff as a case progresses  		through the process, and cases may be sent back for additional investigation  		once an attorney begins final preparation for hearing. </p>
<p>Board staff also recognized that relying on complaints to find problem  		physicians is a reactive process with a very narrow focus that generates a  		large volume of investigation to find a small number of actionable cases,  		especially starting with complaints from the general public. They expressed  		desire in better input from expert sources as well as alternatives to  		conventional discipline. All but one manager complained about the available  		information technology, although two reported that their states had at least  		embarked upon major upgrades. </p>
<p>Finally, some noted that decisions on sanctions must weigh not only  		quality concerns but also competing considerations. For example, whether taking  		disciplinary action in a marginally troublesome case would curtail physician  		access in a rural area or reduce patient access to desired pain medication or  		alternative therapy.</p>
<p><b>Effective Practices for Improving Complaint-Driven Discipline</b>.  		Another focus of the project was identifying effective or potentially effective  		ways to improve Boards quality-related performance. Most input from Board  		managers involved methods they saw as improvements to conventional discipline,  		including:</p>
<ul><li>more effective intake and triage of complaints;</li>
<li>selective enhancements to staff capacity, especially for  		  investigation and investigative oversight (the stage that resolves most  		  cases);</li>
<li>improved access to medical expertise throughout the disciplinary  		  process;</li>
<li>monitoring of throughput of cases in investigation; and </li>
<li>more modern information technology (IT) including more sophisticated  		  data entry, retrieval, and analysis.</li>
</ul><p>IT was prized partly for its ability to save on costs of paperwork and  		data sharing and retrieval. For example, managers reported coping with funding  		shortfalls in part by automating licensure functions and shifting resources to  		discipline. Even more, better IT and data systems were believed to enable  		managers to learn much more about their processes and what people and practices  		work most effectively; over time better tracking capabilities were expected to  		promote better measures to track. Managers wanted to improve their use of  		whatever level of funding and staff they have to work with, improving triage  		and efficiency of throughput in investigation, for example. Experience in two  		states suggests that better analysis of data on accomplishments and shortfalls  		can help persuade legislatures to grant more funding as well as Board-desired  		legal changes. </p>
<p>Two other potentially effective practices sought to enhance medical  		expertise for conventional discipline:</p>
<ul><li>One state reported great success in contracting out medical screening  		  reviews to a national peer review organization. Sources there reported not only  		  expanded access to expertise but also improved speed of review.</li>
<li>Managers in all but the larger states reported interest in regional  		  pooling of experts, as the available in-state expert pool was sometimes very  		  small, especially for subspecialties like pediatric neurology. </li>
</ul><p>Other effective practices were also suggested as improving the  		efficiency of conventional discipline through cross-cutting interventions:</p>
<ul><li>reducing handoffs by creating unified teams of investigators, Board  		  managers, and prosecuting attorneys--especially for high-profile cases almost  		  certain to go to hearing;</li>
<li>more centralization of case oversight to reduce fragmentation of  		  responsibility;</li>
<li>standardization of sanctions to improve consistency and, by  		  extension, deterrent effect; and</li>
<li>more active leadership. </li>
</ul><p>Increased budgets were perceived to be necessary to effectuate many of  		the above noted improvements. All managers believed that improvements in  		budgetary or IT resources would improve their output. There were suggestive  		indications that this is so from the increase in cases closed in Virginia,  		whose budget was significantly increased during the observation period. </p>
<p><b>Other Innovations Ancillary to Complaint Resolution</b>. Such  		practices do not directly affect existing conventional processes of  		disciplinary complaint resolution but rather complement them. </p>
<p>Several Board managers and outside observers suggested that Boards act  		through rules of general application to head off whole categories of  		case-by-case complaints. One state cited the example of prompt development of  		guidelines for bariatric surgery, relatively new as a high-volume procedure.  		Another cited a collaboration with the pharmacy board to block physicians from  		filling prescriptions for controlled substances in the names of family members.  		</p>
<p>Ohios Quality Intervention Program (QIP) is a less formal and  		faster process that uses two subsidiary panels of volunteer physicians to  		resolve less serious looking quality cases, typically ones involving a single  		deficit in a physicians capabilities. Investigators refer quality cases  		to QIP that are likely to be remediable with re-education but that still might  		need to be referred back for conventional discipline and stronger action.</p>
<p>A similar alternative to conventional complaint investigation is  		referral to one of the regional or national clinical assessment centers (CACs)  		run by medical schools and others. The centers use a variety of hands-on  		methods to assess any deficiencies a referred physician might have, and can  		also prepare a program of re-education at the center and continuing back  		home. California refers many conventionally sanctioned physicians to an  		in-state center for remediation, but the other states were just beginning to  		use such centers, mainly earlier in the disciplinary process. </p>
<p>The Massachusetts Boards Patient Care Assessment (PCA) program  		operates quite separately from conventional, complaint-based discipline. The  		Boards PCA unit reviews and approves hospitals own PCA safety plans  		and monitors their operations through several types of required reports. The  		goal is to promote facilities own efforts and to create safe environments  		within which physicians can practice, rather than to identify and sanction  		problem physicians. Managers believe improvements are occurring and also praise  		the process for quickly uncovering the problems in bariatric surgery noted  		above, which would have taken far longer to be discovered through conventional  		complaints.</p>
<p>Another alternative described by case study Board managers and others is  		to encourage hospitals and other medical institutions to identify physicians  		with potential quality problems before they hurt patients or generate  		complaints, referring them to a CAC for evaluation and re-education. A small  		experiment in several states is attempting to demonstrate the feasibility and  		utility of this approach; its performance was not part of this case study.</p>
<p>Online physician profiles have been adopted to better inform prospective  		patients and payers about physician characteristics and thus potentially  		encourage market responses that promote quality. All the study states make such  		information available, at varying levels of detail.</p>
<p><b>Other Innovations</b>. Many Board members and managers wanted to do  		more for safety than react to complaints. The literature review and case study  		respondents suggested some other proactive alternatives to complaint-based  		discipline. These included audits of physician practices, non-disciplinary use  		of CACs, and efforts to encourage ongoing maintenance of competence. Such  		approaches not now observable in the field were beyond the scope of this  		study.</p>
<p><b>Implications</b>. This case study documented many aspects of  		Boards structure and operations. It also identified practices considered  		to make discipline more efficient or effective. Other states could learn from  		the particular practices recommended by managers and others from these six  		states. A cross-cutting lesson is that organized assessments of Board  		performance are useful internally and in seeking a grant of more resources and  		other Board-desired changes from state legislatures.</p>
<p><b>Limitations</b>. The six case study states are not nationally  		representative. They were judgmentally selected to help the project observe  		innovations. The national survey data available provided comparative  		perspective, but not fully standardized definitions of data elements.  		Assessment of the impact of innovations also relied heavily on informed  		judgment, that of knowledgeable managers and other key informants. It is  		generally agreed to be beyond the current state of the art to assess  		performance by measuring any direct impact of Board activities on public health  		or safety.</p>
<p><b>Next steps</b>. One near-term development for Boards will likely  		involve making good use of the new capabilities in IT and data management that  		managers were actively seeking in every case study state. Beyond the hardware  		and software, performance improvement was also said to call for: (i) a new  		approach to data entry and maintenance, (ii) enhanced analytical capabilities,  		and (iii) standards or comparative benchmarks against which to measure  		performance. Data from the Federations member board survey already offers  		Boards some comparative information, but has some limitations, and demand for  		improved comparative benchmarking seems likely to grow.</p>
<p>For policy research, the next steps may be to more rigorously study  		existing state interventions or conduct demonstrations to see how well some of  		them travel to new states. More careful study would be useful for  		such things as Californias use of clinical assessment centers,  		Massachusettss physician profiling and unusual relationship with hospital  		safety efforts (the PCA), Ohios quality improvement program, and efforts  		in numerous states to form teams of investigators, managers, and lawyers to  		streamline the handling of important cases. Non-case study states of course  		also offer opportunities for study.</p>
<h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This project described State Medical Boards disciplinary  		processes, assessed measurement of disciplinary performance, and identified  		practices that Boards believe effectively improve their functioning. Finding  		ways to assess Boards performance is important because states have given  		them a key role in safeguarding medical quality and patient safety.  		Boards importance has become apparent again during the recent medical  		litigation crisis. Many other private and public efforts also attempt to  		protect quality, but all ultimately rely on Boards to address practitioners who  		simply cannot or will not meet minimum standards.</p>
<p>The project used case studies and other methods to address such research  		questions as: </p>
<ul><li>How do Boards perceive their mission?</li>
<li>How does discipline relate to licensure and other Board  		  functions?</li>
<li>What approaches do states use to discipline physicians?</li>
<li>How is performance assessed--by commentators and by Boards  		  themselves?</li>
<li>What factors appear to facilitate or impede disciplinary  		  functioning?</li>
<li>What effective practices have Boards adopted to improve performance  		  that might merit wider adoption?</li>
<li>How does the work of Boards relate to malpractice litigation and to  		  the new patient safety movement?</li>
</ul><p>More detailed background is provided in the projects prior concept  		paper (Bovbjerg and Stockdale 2004).</p>
<h2><a name="goals" id="goals">MOTIVATION AND GOALS OF THE PROJECT</a></h2>
<p>State Medical Boards are one of the earliest public interventions in  		medical quality, dating from the turn of the last century (Ameringer 1999), and  		have newly attracted attention in the recent surge of interest in medical  		quality (Bodenheimer 1999), safety (Kohn et al. 2000), and medical litigation  		reform (Mello et al. 2003). Prior commentary on Boards has long been critical  		of their performance (Derbyshire 1965), but mainly in very general terms, such  		as the failure of licensing boards to discipline licensees (Young  		2002) or that professional self-policing is inherently unreliable. Others  		repeat anecdotes of seemingly egregious physician misbehavior that has  		consistently not been addressed by Boards (Boodman &amp; Davis 2003; Richmond  		Times-Dispatch 2003; Hall 2004; Thompson 2005a, 2005b) or conclude that states  		ranking low in disciplinary rates are simply too low (Public Citizen 2005; CJD  		2002). Suggestions for improvement are usually general as well. </p>
<p>Substantive analysis is rare, and even careful descriptive documentation  		of Board activities is unusual (exceptions include R. Fellmeth 1989; Jost et  		al. 1993; JLARC 2000; J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). In short, the  		literature is long on opinions about Boards but short on documentation, and  		there is almost no analysis of disciplinary activities in practice. How best to  		measure what Boards do is not agreed upon, much less to measure how well they  		do it, and least of all to assess how disciplinary activities affect health  		care outcomes.</p>
<p>This projects overall goal, in the words of the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation statement of work, was to  		improve the documenting and measuring of how Boards operate, so as  		to identify opportunities for improvement. The project was designed  		to produce descriptive information on Boards structures, their missions  		and roles, and their operations. It aimed to develop logic models  		of existing disciplinary processes. Within each model in use, activities and  		functions were to be cataloged, along with existing and potential measures of  		performance. The project then intended to identify impediments to and supports  		for effective performance, as well as effective and potentially effective  		practices for improving performance. We also sought to identify innovative  		alternatives to conventional approaches and key informants perspectives  		on their feasibility and desirability. </p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA AND METHODS</a></h2>
<p>We base the findings presented in this report on information derived  		from four sources--a review of the literature, discussions with national  		experts, case studies of State Medical Boards in six states, and analysis of  		data from national data sets.</p>
<h3>Literature Review and Other Early Input</h3>
<p>The initial literature reviewed included journal articles as well as web  		page materials and Board characteristics in <i>The Exchange</i>, produced by  		the Federation of State Medical Boards or the FSMB<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#notea">a</a></font></sup> (FSMB 2003b). It provided background on Board  		structure and characteristics as well as prior evaluations of performance.  		(Most of the literature reviewed is listed as references at the end of this  		report.) Following our review of the literature, we held directed discussions  		with national experts to help identify issues and discuss states to be  		considered for the case studies. At this stage, a technical advisory group  		(TAG) was created from among national experts to provide additional background  		and help develop the projects conceptual review of issues for further  		investigation (Bovbjerg &amp; Stockdale 2004; see TAG Membership,  		<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>.) </p>
<h3>Case Studies</h3>
<p>The core of the project was case studies in six states--California,  		Iowa, Massachusetts, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington. The case studies provided  		detailed information about each states experiences and approach. Each  		case study began by reviewing written materials found on the states web  		page, provided by state officials in advance, or located in news accounts or  		other sources. Much information came from answers to questions posed during  		site visits, which took place between June 2004 and May 2005, and from  		follow-up telephone calls and subsequently provided written materials. Site  		visits lasting two or three days were made in five of the states. In the sixth  		state, California, the study relied on the states rich written sources  		and used only telephone calls. </p>
<p>During the site visits, we met with the Boards Executive Director,  		typically more than once; if needed, another person with longer historical  		perspective; staff responsible for the main stages of disciplinary process,  		including intake and screening, investigation, charging, and prosecution; a  		person in charge of the automated complaint/case tracking system, if any; an  		experienced attorney, usually from the attorney generals office; and one  		or two Board members. For additional perspective, where possible, we also spoke  		with medical or hospital associations and other outside participants in or  		observers of disciplinary matters. </p>
<p>Before each visit, state officials were sent a discussion guide in  		advance to facilitate preparations, including which staffers to meet, and  		interactions on site. The guide addressed characteristics of Boards and  		conventional disciplinary process that were expected to be common to all states  		based on the literature--including Board history, mission, and vision for the  		future; data on annual expenditures and staffing; description and data on each  		stage of disciplinary process from intake to resolution and potential  		follow-up; and explanations of how managers track the process, what barriers  		they perceive and would like to change, and what standards or rules they use in  		various parts of the process. (See Discussion Guide, <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>.)</p>
<p>For the visits, the discussion guide was augmented with additional  		questions specific to each state based upon review of supplementary literature  		and how that states experience related to the research goals identified  		in the conceptual review:</p>
<ul><li>to generate relevant background information on Boards  		  structures and roles;</li>
<li>to describe logic models of how existing disciplinary  		  activities are meant to work;</li>
<li>to categorize and describe Board activities and functions within each  		  model;</li>
<li>to identify existing and potential measures of performance, overall  		  and by activity;</li>
<li>to assess supports for and barriers to good performance, overall and  		  by activity; and</li>
<li>to describe promising innovative alternatives and their alternative  		  logic.</li>
</ul><p>Each state-level respondent addressed slightly different issues and  		questions depending upon his or her area of responsibility or expertise in  		their respective states. This flexible approach resulted in a wide-ranging  		discussion and allowed us to cover similar issues across states while also  		giving respondents the opportunity to explain their circumstances, their  		experiences, areas of concern, and their plans. Post-visit follow-up by  		telephone and email allowed clarification of the information previously  		obtained. </p>
<p>Overall, this approach provided a full picture of important developments  		in each state, although somewhat different information for each one, given the  		differences in their programs. At the end of the case studies, we spoke again  		with executive directors in all six states to get contemporaneous responses to  		a smaller set of core issues that emerged as a result of case study  		discussions, such as priorities for additional budgeted funds (if they were  		made available), costs of taking a case to full hearing, and perceptions of  		effectiveness relative to other Boards.</p>
<h3>National Data</h3>
<p>Several national data sources supplement the case study information.  		Three come from the Federation of State Medical Boards and one comes from the  		American Medical Association:</p>
<ul><li><i>The Exchange;</i></li>
<li><i>Member Board Annual Survey;</i></li>
<li><i>Summary of Board Actions; and</i> </li>
<li><i>State Medical Licensure Requirements and Statistics.</i> </li>
</ul><p><i>The Exchange</i> is a compilation of descriptive information by state  		about Board structure, staffing, and other characteristics (FSMB 2003b). The  		<i>Member Board Annual Survey </i>is a FSMB database that covers Board budgets,  		staffing, and detail on licensure and discipline (see Member Board Annual  		Survey, <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#appendD">Appendix D</a>). Boards in 48 states and the  		District of Columbia responded to the survey, although not to every  		question.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote1">1</a></font></sup> We  		acquired the data for 2003, the most recent available. The <i>Summary of Board  		Actions</i> provides an annual tally of disciplinary activities and numbers of  		physicians (FSMB 2005). Again, we used data from 2003. <i>State Medical  		Licensure Requirements and Statistics</i> is a manual of licensure fees and  		other requirements by state (AMA 2006). These national sources greatly enrich  		the case study observations and provide context for interpreting the field  		observations. </p>
<p>The <i>Member Survey</i> is conducted under promise of confidentiality,  		and its database was obtained without state identifiers (see <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#appendD">Appendix D</a>). We subsequently obtained case study  		states permission to identify their states, so as to link survey data  		with other information, but this report maintains the Federations promise  		of confidentiality. Information specific to individual states is presented  		where relevant, mainly when available from public sources. Some exhibits  		identify states only by rank numbers, which differ from exhibit to exhibit.</p>
<p>Because states are identified in <i>Board Actions</i> and <i>The  		Exchange</i>, measures such as budget per physician can be calculated.  		<i>Member Survey</i> data are confidential, however, so that disciplinary  		staffing and complaint data cannot be adjusted for or compared with state  		characteristics known only from public data, nor can full national totals be  		computed, as some medical Boards did not respond. The <i>Member Survey</i> also  		includes an unknown number of responses from the nations 14 osteopathic  		boards and four territorial boards, which are systematically much smaller than  		State Medical Boards in licensees and staffing. Although the latter types of  		boards are likely underrepresented among survey respondents,<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote2">2</a></font></sup> most presentations of data in  		this report omit extreme values, as a way of focusing more reliably on State  		Medical Boards--for example, by presenting only a percentile range rather than  		maximums and minimums.</p>
<h3>Overview of Case Study States and Analytic Approach</h3>
<p>The six study states were selected for having Boards with reputations  		for being well administered and to include Board innovations of interest.  		Selection also sought diversity in geographic location, extent of Board  		independence as defined by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB 2003b),  		and other characteristics. Together, the six study states account for about  		one-quarter of the nations practicing medical doctors (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>). </p>

</tr></table><p>California is the largest of the case study states and has changed board  		structures several times. Its Board has more written description and data  		available online than the other study states combined. Not only does the Board  		compile extensive information, but the legislature also recently funded a  		separate, temporary office of Discipline Monitor to provide analysis and  		recommendations (e.g., J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). Iowa is a much  		smaller state that has recently coped with a large backlog of disciplinary  		cases. The Massachusetts Board has an apparently unique role in reviewing  		hospital safety and an evolving relationship with other patient safety efforts  		within and outside state government. Ohio was an early adopter of formal  		standards for triaging disciplinary complaints and created an unusual, less  		formal process for reviewing certain complaints related to medical quality (its  		Quality Intervention Program). Virginias Board was the subject of an  		unusually detailed legislative critique in 1999, which prompted numerous  		changes, including a change in legal standard of proof to facilitate  		disciplinary prosecutions (JLARC 2000). Washington state is part of an umbrella  		agency, recently had its standard of proof increased by judicial action, and  		recently undertook a thorough assessment of its own disciplinary performance.  		</p>
<p>This report presents descriptive statistics on State Medical Boards,  		descriptive analyses, and synthesis of respondents expert judgments about  		problems and performance. It also assesses the logic model of how  		Boards seek to discipline physicians. The logic-model approach describes the  		inputs, activities, and regulatory outputs that Boards consider important to  		their mission, along with the causal links among them, a standard approach to  		program assessment (Hatry 1999). These foci resemble the quality assessment  		trilogy of input, process, and outcome (Donabedian 1966, 1972, 1980) but are  		more practical and measurable.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote3">3</a></font></sup> Assessing Board activities impacts on  		ultimate outcomes in health care, like morbidity, mortality and medical injury,  		would go well beyond current capabilities because outcomes are poorly measured  		and are affected by so many other factors than Board discipline.</p>
<p>The case studies and this report focus on the last five years. These  		years differed from the prior five in several respects. First, state budgets  		were under great strain. Revenues dropped markedly across the nation after  		fiscal 2001, owing to economic recession and sharp drops in taxpayers  		capital gains, while Medicaid and some other spending programs rose rapidly  		(Boyd &amp; Jenny 2003). Significant program cuts were common, as were state  		hiring freezes or layoffs and across-the-board cuts in some administrative  		support (Coughlin &amp; Zuckerman 2005; J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004).  		Second, much new publicity about the extent of medical errors was generated by  		the rise of the patient safety movement and the release of the  		Institute of Medicine book <i>To Err Is Human</i> (Kohn et al. 2000). Third,  		starting in 2000, physician malpractice premiums rose rapidly in most states,  		prompting calls for legal reform and increasing public and legislative concerns  		about physician competence and extent of negligent behavior (Mello et al. 2003;  		Blendon et al. 2002).</p>
<h2><a name="logic" id="logic">THE REGULATORY LOGIC OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS</a></h2>
<h3>Boards Mission and Activities</h3>
<p>Medical regulation is an exercise of states inherent police power  		to protect public health and welfare. State enabling statutes, typically called  		medical practice acts, date from a century ago. Protecting the public is today  		generally recognized as the main rationale for State Medical Boards (OIG 1986;  		Finocchio et al. 1998, p.5, FSMB 2003a).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote4">4</a></font></sup> The logic of public protection is very  		straightforward: Boards should identify unqualified or unfit doctors and bar  		them from practice in the state, which directly protects patients from them (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit2">Exhibit 2</a>). Indirectly, imposition of sanctions may also  		lead other physicians to practice more carefully or to tailor their practices  		to their capabilities. Removal of unsafe physicians from practice has been the  		most often commented on Board activity (Public Citizen 2005; CJD 2002), but in  		practice Boards more often impose lesser sanctions, including occasional formal  		re-education, that aim to keep physicians available to serve patients but with  		improved future performance.</p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="exhibit2" id="exhibit2">EXHIBIT 2</a>: The  			 Simple Logic of Public Protection</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/68466/stdiscpE2.JPG" alt="logic graphic" /></td>
</tr></table><p>Boards exercise two main regulatory functions, licensure and discipline.  		</p>
<p><b>Licensure</b> requires a demonstration of educational attainment and  		knowledge as evidence of competence at the time when doctors first begin  		practice in a state, whether as a new physician or a mid-career transfer from  		another state. Over time, requirements for continuing education were added as a  		condition of licensure renewal. Today, many policy makers are calling for  		periodic testing of practitioners as a condition of re-licensure, to monitor  		continuing competence throughout physicians careers (discussed  		below).</p>
<p><b>Discipline</b>, in contrast, oversees ongoing practice in a state.  		Physicians can be disciplined for numerous misbehaviors, from business offenses  		to problems in the quality of care. Disciplinary actions range in severity from  		non-public warning letters, to public reprimand, to suspension or revocation of  		the license to practice. The theory is that discipline protects the public  		directly by removing some problem physicians from practice, restricting their  		scope of practice, or improving their practice. The threat of discipline is  		also meant to deter physicians from practicing beyond their capabilities.</p>
<p>Although discipline is the key method of protecting the public from low  		quality care,<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote5">5</a></font></sup> most  		Boards perform three other quality-related functions with regard to practicing  		physicians: continuing medical education, some quality-relevant rule making (as  		on use of drugs), and mid-career licensure (as for immigration of out-of-state  		physicians).</p>
<h3>Structural Factors as Enablers or Impediments to  		Disciplinary Performance</h3>
<p>Structural characteristics are often said to influence what approaches  		are taken to discipline as well as disciplinary effectiveness in practice (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit3">Exhibit 3</a>). Some factors are perceived to support Boards  		and enable them to run effective disciplinary processes. Often cited among  		these are the following (e.g., Ameringer 1999; Fellmeth 2003; Finocchio et al.  		1995; FSMB 1998, 2002; Public Citizen 2005):</p>

</ul><p>The case studies and state-specific literature reviews were designed to  		assess the influence of these structural factors on observed operations of  		medical discipline.

<h2><a name="findings" id="findings">FINDINGS ON BOARD STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES</a></h2>
<p>State medical practice acts establish Boards missions, structures  		and powers, and administrative procedure acts governs many Board processes,  		especially for promulgating regulations and holding hearings. Legislation also  		provides Boards with their budgets and staffing authority. Boards add  		specificity to general legislative language through regulations, guidelines,  		and internal practices. Some judicial decisions affect Boards powers and  		activities as well. This section considers the structural factors that are  		often said to influence disciplinary activities and that influence perceptions  		of Boards independence.</p>
<h3>Board Membership, Terms and Remuneration</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the core of a State Medical Board was its panel of board  		members (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit4">Exhibit 4</a>). All or almost all members were  		physicians, typically selected by governors from a list submitted by the  		states medical society or other organized medical group(s). Some medical  		society influence survives in some states, either by law (as in New  		York)<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote7">7</a></font></sup> or tradition;  		but starting in the 1980s, the role of organized medicine has generally been  		reduced (Adams 2001a).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="exhibit4" id="exhibit4">EXHIBIT 4</a>: Board vs.  			 board: A Note on Nomenclature</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>All the  			 observed states have literal boards (small b) as  			 described in this section. These boards are panels that function like a very  			 active board of trustees. Physician and other board members serve part-time,  			 convening periodically to help set general policy and decide on the merits of  			 specific disciplinary cases put to them. These boards roles and level of  			 authority vary by state. Day-to-day administrative operations in the six study  			 states are conducted by a full-time staff of state employees, typically headed  			 by an executive director. In a broader sense, medical Board  			 (capital B) means the collectivity of the board/panel, all board  			 staff, and all other administrative entities responsible for any aspect of  			 physician licensure and discipline. This report mainly describes capital-B  			 Boards, which facilitates making cross-state comparisons. In all states Boards  			 run similar processes for similar reasons, but their component board/panels  			 each play smaller or larger roles according to each states specific  			 legislative design and administrative arrangements.</font></td>
</tr></table><p>Almost every state now requires some number of lay members, on the  		theory that they are more likely to hold errant physicians accountable (e.g.,  		Robeznieks 2002b; Peters 2005). The typical medical board today has 10-15  		members and usually covers osteopathic physicians; stand-alone osteopathic  		boards are smaller. Some states require geographically representative  		membership, typically based on Congressional districts. For example, California  		has 21 members, split between autonomous divisions of licensure and discipline;  		14 serve in discipline, functionally split into two panels of seven to decide  		disciplinary cases (California Board 2003).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote9">9</a></font></sup> No state has a majority of non-physicians;  		in the six study states, their share ranges from 21-37% (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>). Sometimes other medical practitioners are also  		represented. Often, the board chair must be a physician. </p>
<p>Board members are appointed by state governors to staggered terms, most  		commonly of four years (FSMB 2003b). The longest term nationally is 8 years,  		the shortest is 3 years. Two study states had 3 year terms, three 4 years and  		one 5 years. Typically, members may be re-appointed to an additional term, but  		almost all states have 2-term limits; only six states have no limits on number  		of terms. Four study states had 2-term limits; one had three, and one was  		unlimited. Payment levels are set at the level of per diem honoraria rather  		than remuneration for professional time lost from other work. Daily allowances  		typically range from $50 to $100 (FSMB 2003b); Washington is among the highest  		states at $250.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote10">10</a></font></sup>  		Consequently, Board members generally serve in this capacity on a part-time  		basis and almost all work full-time in another job.</p>
<p>In practice, Board executives reported that they strive to keep some  		representation of key medical specialties on the board, including obstetrics.  		Specialized public member skills, especially those of an experienced attorney,  		are also valued. Professional skills, however, are not the same as Board member  		skills needed for disciplinary case review, consideration of new Board rules,  		and the like. An executive director in a non-case study state suggested having  		long terms and monthly board meetings more quickly develops a good skill base  		among members, compared with some states that meet only quarterly and have  		shorter terms, which does not afford enough time to learn to do the job well.  		One national advocacy group provides education for new consumer Board  		members.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote11">11</a></font></sup> The  		rationale is that they can be more effective participants if helped to advance  		up the learning curve and make them comfortable in sitting on a Board with  		expert professionals.</p>
<p>Staff elsewhere noted the importance of rebuilding institutional memory  		when members change. Professional Board staff are thus concerned about member  		recruitment and turnover. In one state, key informants expressed satisfaction  		with having longer than usual tenure and no problem with turnover. In two  		others, strong concerns were expressed about inexperienced new Board members  		and the difficulties of keeping good members to work long hours for little pay  		(relative to what most physicians earn).</p>
<h3>Boards Place within State Administrative  		Operations</h3>
<p>A frequently made structural distinction is whether a Medical Board is  		free-standing or instead part of an umbrella administrative agency.  		Umbrella agencies group together various licensing boards, usually in one of  		two approaches. A department of health may group boards of medicine, nursing,  		pharmacy and the like. A department of professional licensure typically  		includes far more occupations.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote12">12</a></font></sup> Organizational structures in state  		government vary considerably across states and over time within a state (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a>). </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="exhibit5" id="exhibit5">EXHIBIT 5</a>: Administrative Structures  			 in States</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>State  			 hierarchies seldom follow standardized, predictable patterns. Over time all  			 have tended to add various departments, divisions, offices, commissions, and  			 boards, as well as quasi-public entities. Reorganizations also occur. In  			 Massachusetts, the State Medical Board in 2003 was moved from an administrative  			 home within the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation to the  			 Department of Public Health. Public Health also directly licenses a number of  			 other health care professions and institutions, but some remain in Consumer  			 Affairs. Washington state effected a similar reorganization over a decade  			 ago.</font></td>
</tr></table><p>Medical boards also typically act as mini-umbrellas themselves. Most  		medical boards oversee physician assistants (80% of all boards, nationally,  		according to calculations from Federation data). Within the six case study  		states, various boards also covered such other professions as acupuncturists,  		chiropractors, osteopathic physicians, physical therapists, and respiratory  		therapists, even massage therapists and naturopaths. Nationally, 14 states have  		separate osteopathic medical boards.</p>
<p>In a variation on the umbrella/independent typology, the Federation  		categorizes Board structure as independent, semi-independent, or advisory to a  		state agency (FSMB 2003b). The Federation typology goes beyond umbrella status  		to consider the extent to which a Medical Board exercises authority over key  		functions. It defines independent boards as those that exercise all  		licensing and disciplinary powers, though some clerical services may be  		provided by a central agency. Semi-independent means that the board  		exercises some key powers; central agency may provide clerical and  		administrative services and make some decisions. Advisory means that the  		board acts in a purely advisory role to a larger entity (FSMB  		2003b). Nationally, the Federation classifies about two-thirds of boards as  		independent, almost a third semi-independent. Only three Medical Boards are  		advisory. As already noted, three study states are classified as independent,  		three as semi-independent (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>). Such  		classifications are useful descriptors, although somewhat subjective.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Sharing of Functions beyond Medical  		Boards</b></i></p>
<p>All boards, independent or not, are to some extent integrated into state  		government and rely on other state entities for some functions. Board staff are  		normally state employees and subject to civil service rules and any applicable  		union requirements; executive directors may be exempted. Other functions  		typically handled outside of a Medical Board and its immediate staff include  		revenue collections and payroll disbursements, acquisition and management of  		office space, as well as purchase and support for information technology. Most  		notable among other changes, some Board members and managers described having  		to cope with new intra-governmental charges imposed by central authorities for  		such services, which were once provided without charge. Moreover, all the  		observed Medical Boards had to rely upon state Attorney Generals offices  		for legal representation in disciplinary cases. All were also subject to  		general administrative cost-cutting measures imposed by central authority,  		notably including staff freezes. And in promulgating rules or adjudicating  		disputes, all had to adhere to the same procedural requirements as other  		agencies under each states Administrative Procedure Act.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because disciplinary functions are shared differently in different  		states, what the medical boards do is not directly comparable.  		Hence this paper refers to capital-B Boards to include the totality  		of a states arrangements for exercising all licensure and disciplinary  		functions (see <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit4">Exhibit 4</a>). </p>
<h3>Statutory Support for Board Actions</h3>
<p>State enabling acts give Boards their mission to protect the public, set  		statutory grounds for discipline, and establish available sanctions. Contrary  		to traditional complaints (e.g., Derbyshire 1974, 1979), state officials seldom  		cited unclear mission or inadequate legal grounds for discipline as a  		limitation on their ability to take action, perhaps partly because of statutory  		amendments. California has been the most active of the six case study states,  		enacting significant legislative reforms in 1990, 1993, 1995, 1997, and 2002.  		The 1990 act explicitly set protection of the public as the highest  		priority for the Medical Board and also set investigative priorities, created a  		new oversight position of independent enforcement monitor, and required  		specialized medical review of quality of care complaints (California Board  		2004; J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). Most boards today can address a broad  		range of problems--for instance, Ohios statute gives 38 grounds for  		discipline.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote15">15</a></font></sup> Key  		informants also noted that they could often infer authority from general  		provisions.</p>
<p>Board officials do find it useful to have a broad range of sanctions  		available. Being able to apply a lesser sanction for a lesser offense (or less  		readily provable one) enables Boards to negotiate voluntary settlements rather  		than having to seek a stronger sanction through the much more protracted and  		expensive process of a full-blown adversarial hearing. Most Boards have such a  		range of sanctions available. In Virginia, statutory reform in 2003 gave its  		Board authority to address minor misconduct through a totally  		confidential consent agreement.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In practice, however, according to officials in several states,  		negotiating agreement to even a minor sanction without a hearing is today more  		difficult than in the past. For example, physicians fear being barred from  		health plans provider networks for almost any Board action, which reduced  		willingness to settle and raises the costs of achieving any sanctions.</p>
<p>The standards by which Boards judge potential offenses were mentioned as  		a substantial issue in two states. In 2001, Washingtons Supreme Court  		increased the standard of proof by which the Board must make disciplinary  		findings from mere preponderance of the evidence, that is, that an  		offense more likely occurred than not, to clear and convincing  		evidence.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote17">17</a></font></sup>  		Nationally and among the case study states, about two-thirds of Boards use a  		preponderance standard and one-third the higher, clear and  		convincing rule. Other states have shifted the other way; Maryland by  		statute adopted the preponderance standard in 2003, although not for discipline  		based on quality of care concerns.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In Washington, officials reported that the higher standard made their  		job more difficult. In Virginia, the traditional standard was gross  		ignorance or malpractice, that is, persistently outrageous behavior. The  		standard was reduced to a finding of intentional or negligent  		conduct likely to cause injury.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote19">19</a></font></sup> Consequently, workload in Virginia  		increased and the state raised fees in an effort to compensate.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The legal authority to subpoena records was cited as very important by  		managers in Ohio. Traditionally, their Board lacked subpoena power, a basic  		tool of legal investigation. That power was added by a 1980s reform. </p>
<h3>Board Funding and Staffing</h3>
<p>The sources and extent of available funding also affect a Medical  		Boards effective exercise of autonomy.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote21">21</a></font></sup> In all six case study states, boards are  		almost exclusively funded from physician licensure fees, as seems to be true  		for the country at large. Usually fee levels are set by statute, sometimes by  		regulation. Regardless of the legal arrangements, managers reported that their  		budgets are effectively subject to legislative control rather than under full  		control of each Board. Virginia was unusual in that the Board--that is, its  		umbrella agency--can increase fees by regulation, though within legislative  		guidelines. In four of the states, physician fees went into a Medical Board  		trust fund separate from general state revenues. Fines, however, often went to  		the state treasury. Some commentators and an occasional state-level study  		participant have cited earmarked physician fee-based funding as evidence of  		board independence. However, the Boards typically need legislative approval to  		draw on their funds.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In practice, how much financial support Medical Boards receive depends  		both upon the level of licensure and other fees assessed (including whether the  		Board retains any fines or other monies collected) as well as how much of fees  		the legislature appropriates. Any mid-year or ongoing cutbacks on spending  		authority or staffing are also influential. Annual fees range widely, in the  		case study states from $153 to $300, nationally from $51 to $450 (AMA  		2006).</p>
<p>Substantially more physicians obtain licenses--and pay some level of  		fee--than actively practice in the state. The six study states had from 20% to  		73% more licensees than practicing physicians (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit6">Exhibit  		6</a>), an average of 35% more, slightly below the national average of 44%. It  		is notable that Virginia and Iowa, the states highest in non-practicing  		licensees, have sizable river border populations whose metropolitan areas spill  		into adjoining jurisdictions. The two lowest states, in contrast, have their  		concentrated populations along their seacoasts. Higher fees may also lower the  		extent of double licensing by making it more expensive to keeping a little used  		license in active status.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote23">23</a></font></sup> More thorough national analyses could  		improve upon such casual empiricism.</p>

</tr></table><p>Because physician fees are set in nominal dollars, fee revenues can rise  		only as fast as the population of licensees, unless the governor and  		legislature act to raise them. Fixed fees plausibly keep up with workload  		driven by the population of physicians overseen, but they generate no  		additional funding to cope with shifts in workload patterns, nor to meet rising  		regulatory salaries and other expenses. Officials and other respondents  		reported great physician resistance to fee increases in all states, and most  		reported that many years passed between fee increases. Some observers have  		noted that fees are often raised as part of a legislative reform in response to  		highly publicized Board shortcomings.</p>
<p><i><b>Budgets</b></i></p>
<p>Boards annual budgets vary widely across states, even taking into  		account the variation in number of physicians regulated (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit7">Exhibit 7</a>).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote24">24</a></font></sup> Nationally, the best funded 25% of Boards  		receive more than double the resources per in-state practicing physician as  		their lower funded counterparts in the bottom 25%.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote25">25</a></font></sup> This difference across states seems  		large, given that Boards perform very similar functions in all states. (Based  		on knowledge of the case study states, we believe these reported budgets  		typically cover similar Board functions regardless of whether some spending  		occurs in an umbrella agency.)</p>
<p>Budgets also ranged broadly in the six case study states--the highest is  		almost double the lowest. All the case study states, however, lie in the middle  		half of Boards nationwide; none is a budgetary outlier. The highest case study  		state is only at the 75th percentile nationally, and the bottom one is just  		above the 25th percentile nationwide. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, most of the case study states must operate more frugally  		than average: Five of the six have funding that is below the national average  		as well as the median. Exactly how frugally depends upon the relative costs of  		labor and other expenses of operating a regulatory agency in different states,  		but no adjustment can readily be made for this practical budgetary concern.</p>

</tr></table><p>All Board managers in the six case-study states reported frequent if not  		constant budgetary worries; one reported occasional declines in state financial  		support. All reported that constrained funding or staffing limited their  		capabilities to discipline doctors, although not necessarily in the same ways.  		Respondents in all states also reported that their Boards do not receive all  		fee revenues. Some said that physician fees are intermingled with those of  		other professions within an umbrella agency.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote26">26</a></font></sup> Others said that some share of fees has  		ended up being retained by the state, sometimes as a result of trust fund  		re-allocations as described above. The Massachusetts Board got an especially  		low share of fees, only about 40% before 2002 legislation raised fees. The  		Board got 100% of that increase, which was a condition for the medical  		societys supporting the fee increase. The increase doubled the  		Boards available resources, but it still received only 75% of licensure  		fees paid to the state (Massachusetts 2003).</p>
<h2><a name="importance" id="importance">THE IMPORTANCE OF BOARDS DISCIPLINARY  		ROLE</a></h2>
<p>Discipline is a key function of Boards and seems to be rising in  		importance. In the later 1990s, the Pew Trusts commission on workforce  		reform surveyed medical organizations and individuals about ten areas of  		workforce policy on which the commission had recommended reforms (Gragnola and  		Stone 1997). Respondents showed a relatively low level of concern about  		disciplinary improvement. The top three areas of concern were titles and scopes  		of practice, redesign of Boards structure and functions, and assuring  		continuing competence of practitioners--the latter an alternative to  		case-by-case discipline that also addressed improving quality. </p>
<p>Case study Board executive directors rated recent changes in public  		perceptions of disciplines importance.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote27">27</a></font></sup> All but one reported some level of  		increase (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit8">Exhibit 8</a>).

</tr></table><p>The importance of discipline shows also in how Boards allocate their  		funding internally. National survey data do not track discipline as a category  		in asking Boards how they break out spending by function. The similar category  		reported is investigation, which is the most expensive part of discipline. </p>
<p>The national median for share of budget spent on investigative functions  		is 49%, compared with 27% on administrative functions, and 21% on licensing (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit9">Exhibit 9</a>). The median for case study states is slightly  		higher. The full disciplinary share of funding is likely higher than 49%. Some  		fraction of the spending categorized as administrative probably pays for  		executives and medical board members involvement in disciplinary  		activities, up to and including conduct of hearings.</p>
<p>A final indicator of the importance of discipline to Boards is  		executives priorities for use of any revenue increase. In post-case study  		follow-up discussions with executive directors, the project asked how they  		would allocate a hypothetical15% budgetary increase. We used the three  		categories deemed to be standard--discipline,  		licensure, and administration. We added  		information technology because some Board staffers had said earlier  		that it is very important; IT could facilitate activities across all three  		functions. </p>

<p>The primary Board function of interest is discipline. The primary  		process by which Boards seek to discipline physicians is investigation of  		complaints. The case study participants agreed with the literature on the  		centrality of complaint resolution. Some alternatives are in use or discussed,  		which are considered separately below.</p>
<p>Each Board handles complaints somewhat differently. Everywhere, cases go  		through the same basic stages of processing, however. Moreover, all Boards must  		address very similar issues in deciding what methods and standards to use at  		each stage of complaint resolution. </p>
<p>The five basic stages are intake, investigation, pre-hearing process,  		hearing, and action (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit11">Exhibit 11</a>). Each stage begins  		with input of cases from the prior stage and ends either by current resolution  		or by forwarding the case to the next stage of the process. The diagram shows  		the full progression of stages, but most cases drop out along the way. States  		also differ in the number of steps a case may go through within each diagramed  		stage; <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit12">Exhibit 12</a> generalizes and simplifies for  		clarity of presentation. The diagram also omits the parallel, non-disciplinary  		rehabilitation process to which physicians may be diverted for problems of  		mental health or substance abuse.</p>

<h3>Intake of Complaints</h3>
<p><b><i>Sources of Complaints</i></b></p>
<p>Throughout the case study, all Board managers and staff agreed that most  		complaints come from the public, usually patients or family members. Most  		states call all disciplinary cases complaints even when there is no  		complainant. </p>
<p>Five states provided information on sources of complaints (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit12">Exhibit 12</a>). The reported public share of complaints  		ranged from about 60% to 90%.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote29">29</a></font></sup> The next most common sources are other  		public agencies and hospitals, accounting for a much smaller share of  		complaints. Three states received a substantial minority of complaints from  		other sources, an omnibus category that includes such sources as: </p>
<ul><li>physicians, nurses, pharmacists, other health personnel;</li>
<li>Board staff (based on media reports or offshoot of separate  		  investigation), a particularly high source in one state;</li>
<li>hospital peer review;</li>
<li>malpractice claims notifications; and</li>
<li>police or drug enforcement officials.</li>

</tr></table><p>Many of these other sources come in the form of a standardized report,  		such as from malpractice insurers or courts, hospital disciplinary authorities,  		or other agencies taking certain actions, which vary by state. These are  		typically screened, and only some become complaints, subject to  		investigation.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote30">30</a></font></sup>  		Complainants typically must submit complaints with some degree of formality--on  		a signed written form, in a similar online form, or by telephone. Ohio is  		unusual in accepting anonymous complaints (although they represent a negligible  		proportion of the total); most states ask for names because anonymous  		complaints are hard to investigate and prosecute. Individual complainants are  		asked for details of the perceived problem, which become the basis for  		investigation.</p>
<p><b><i>Types of Complaints</i></b></p>
<p>Boards do not typically report information on the nature of complaints  		in annual reports or other regular compilations.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote31">31</a></font></sup> The categories by which they code cases  		internally are idiosyncratic, often seeming to relate to the particular  		statutory listing of sanctionable offenses under which each Board operates.  		This case study sought information on states top three categories of  		complaints, with special attention to cases involving clinical quality for  		which expert reviews could be anticipated. No existing category in any state  		matched this definition. The categories reported were too disparate to tally  		for all six study states. One state reported changing its coding of complaints  		in 2003.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote32">32</a></font></sup> It can be  		noted that in California, about 40% of complaints in 2003-04 received a quality  		review; in Massachusetts about 12% in 2003 (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004;  		Massachusetts Board 2003). The FSMB Member Survey does not obtain information  		on types of complaints, possibly because states lack common definitions on  		which to report. Seeking to create consistency was outside the purview of this  		project.</p>
<p><b><i>Volume of Complaints</i></b></p>
<p>The case study Boards varied considerably in number of complaints  		received, from a low of about 700 to a high of nearly 9,000.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote33">33</a></font></sup> Larger states naturally  		generate more complaints than smaller ones, but complaint volume still ranges  		widely even after accounting for number of practicing physicians. The typical  		study Board received about 100 complaints per thousand physicians, but the high  		was one-quarter larger, and the low three-quarters lower (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit13">Exhibit 13</a>). Some of this variation may be due to varying  		definitions of complaint in state intake processes. Board managers  		and staff uniformly said that they log in almost all public complaints, but  		many reports from other entities do not become complaints. Officials reported  		that caseloads are rising over time, but such increases were not uniform. </p>

</tr></table><p>Importantly for Boards ability to resolve complaints promptly, the  		volume of complaints received can seem high relative to the staff available to  		process them.

</tr></table><p><b><i>Intake Triage of Complaints</i></b></p>
<p>Generally, clerical intake staff log in complaints as they arrive,  		although in very rare cases, a misdirected communication may not even be logged  		in. The Boards all use automated systems for docketing and tracking cases, but  		resulting data are not routinely integrated with other relevant data on  		operations.</p>
<p>Once logged, cases are screened to determine whether the Board has  		jurisdiction, that is, whether the Board could legally take action if the  		complaint is found accurate. Some aspects of triage can be carried out by a  		paralegal or even by experienced clerical staff who have developed a  		feel for complaint handling. Intake triage is a modest screening  		process that avoids expensive investigation of every complaint or communication  		received. </p>
<p>The main reason for closure without investigation is that a complaint is  		non-jurisdictional (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>). It may be  		misfiled with the Medical Board and need to be referred to a different agency  		that has responsibility, such as a Board of Pharmacy or Nursing.  		Non-jurisdictional closures also occur where a complaint involves physician  		conduct not constituting an offense, such as refusal to accept Medicare  		patients, overcharging for services, or failure to provide sufficient patient  		parking. </p>
<p>Another reason for closure is that the conduct, while potentially  		actionable, was deemed too minor to warrant action, sometimes referred to as  		below threshold cases. Such matters include allegedly offensive  		language (short of sexual harassment) and minor billing disputes (short of  		fraud). Two states intake and enforcement staff said that they track  		below threshold closures and occasionally have disciplined a physician for  		repeated offenses. There appear to be no standardized subcategories for  		closures at this stage, and the Member Survey codes all such closures as  		non-jurisdictional.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote35">35</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Intake triage accomplishes the first winnowing as cases proceed through  		the disciplinary process. Nationally, about 14% of closures in 2003 occurred  		before investigation (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>). The balance  		proceeded to some level of investigation.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>The investigational stage consists of cases about which Board staff seek  		more information in order to resolve the complaint. This stage accounts for a  		large share of states disciplinary effort (accounting for half or more of  		Boards spending, <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit10">Exhibit 10</a> above), and cases  		are handled in different ways according to their perceived importance.  		Operational details and the flow of cases through this stage also vary by  		state. The following description is a general one.</p>
<p><i><b>Investigative Triage and Levels of  		Investigation</b></i></p>
<p>Full investigation is very resource intensive, so assignments are  		typically made by some form of triage team of more senior staff in the  		Boards investigations or enforcement unit. Depending on the stage of the  		process and the seriousness of the complained about behavior, different  		combinations of decision makers may be involved. For significant cases decision  		making may also involve enforcement attorneys. California conducts unusually  		extensive triage of quality cases, subjecting all to a medical  		consultant review before assigning them for investigation in the field  		(J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). It thus reports a much higher share of  		cases closed before investigation than is presented in <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>. Ongoing oversight may also close a case when  		early investigation is not promising. </p>
<p>The extent of investigation undertaken can vary widely. Some cases are  		assigned for office based or in house investigation via  		phone calls or a request for written information from the physician. Some of  		the states provide for an informal, confidential conference with the respondent  		physician at this stage. State officials reported, however, that physicians  		increasingly involve defense attorneys in any interaction they have with their  		Board.</p>
<p>Other cases are assigned to a field investigator for interviewing of  		witnesses as well as obtaining medical records and other information at a  		physicians office, hospital, pharmacy, or other location. What  		information is needed depends on the nature and severity of the case. Cases  		alleging substandard clinical care or incompetence require much more effort  		than those based on criminal conviction or revocation of license in another  		jurisdiction, for example. It may sometimes be necessary to formally subpoena  		records, but investigators typically try to obtain voluntary compliance with  		requests. </p>
<p>A small share of high-priority cases, those posing serious, ongoing  		threats to patients, are investigated immediately on what many call a  		fast track basis. Boards usually have authority to impose summary  		suspensions in such cases, pending final resolution, although it is not clear  		how often such suspensions occur.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote37">37</a></font></sup> For fast track or other unusual cases  		obviously bound for prosecution, staff may constitute a team of complaint,  		investigative, and legal staff to prepare each case for hand off to  		prosecutors.</p>
<p>Investigators also must prioritize their own regular caseloads as a  		matter of routine because more recently received cases may be more important  		than older pending ones. Caseloads can reach into the hundreds, and backlogs  		are a common problem at this stage of disciplinary process, one that has drawn  		considerable managerial attention, as considered more below. </p>
<p><b><i>Staffing</i></b></p>
<p>Investigators typically work in their own section or department of the  		Board, or totally separated from other functions in an umbrella agency.  		Investigative staff account for almost half of Board staff nationally, more in  		the case study states, much like the investigative share of spending (not  		presented, similar to <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit10">Exhibit 10</a>). Investigation does  		not operate in complete isolation from licensure, however. Some disciplinary  		complaints are generated by licensure renewal forms that ask  		physicians to self-disclose such things as malpractice claims and other legal  		problems. Some initial or endorsement licensure applications may have gaps in  		histories or other anomalies on which the licensure section may ask for  		investigative help.</p>
<p>The typical Board nationally received 32 complaints per staff member in  		2003, slightly more for the median case study Board. Relative to investigative  		staff, the ratios are higher--some 70:1 nationally and 46:1 in the case study  		states reporting. These complaint-volume-to-staff ratios are slightly higher  		than the actual investigatory caseload, as 14% of complaints are dropped before  		investigation (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>). </p>
<p>Investigators in most states are assigned geographically and spend much  		of their time alone on the road. This offsite mode of operation complicates  		record keeping and managerial oversight, although cell phones and computers  		keep investigators more integrated into home office operations than  		they once were. Most investigators have prior law enforcement experience rather  		than nursing or other medical expertise, which was not given high priority by  		discussants. Today, in most Boards, medical expertise is mainly applied outside  		the field, through review of records generated or obtained by non-medical  		investigators. Turnover among investigative staff is frequently said to be a  		problem, but consistent data are not readily available to support or refute  		that assertion.</p>
<p><i><b>Closures of Investigations</b></i></p>
<p>Three-quarters of investigations end with closure during investigation  		(<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>). The main reason for closure is that  		investigation has generated insufficient evidence to support Board action. A  		small share of closures involve unilateral Board issuance of an informal, minor  		sanction such as a letter of education or warning (as they are called in Iowa)  		or a voluntary agreement with the respondent physician to a more significant  		action. All information gathered typically remains confidential until the Board  		takes such action. In several states, study participants noted that the process  		had become less informal over time. Whereas once they could resolve many cases  		through discussions with a doctor, physicians now much more often involve an  		attorney even for preliminary interactions with Board staff. Informal or  		intermediate hearings may be held to determine whether a case should be  		continued.</p>
<p>Investigators write reports with recommendations, and higher level staff  		or Board members make the decision whether to proceed. Outside audits of Board  		practices in two states in earlier periods found shortcomings in extent of  		investigation before closure.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote38">38</a></font></sup> If the decision is to close the case, a  		Board committee or Medical Board member may have to agree. If moved forward,  		the next stage is further consideration of whether to formally  		charge a physician and seek a more severe sanction.</p>
<h3>Pre-Hearing Process: Charging and Settlement or  		Prosecution</h3>
<p>About 20% of all complaints nationally reached this stage in 2003 (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>). In this pre-hearing process, Boards make a  		final decision on whether to drop an investigated case, to issue a letter of  		warning or take other non-prejudicial action,<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote39">39</a></font></sup> or instead to bring formal charges,  		seeking significant sanctions. The decision to bring charges is akin to a  		probable cause determination in criminal process and may be referred to as  		such.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The charge document may have different names, including  		citation and accusation. Doctors are legally entitled  		to have formal notice of the charges against them, and issuing charges has  		significant implications for both the Board and for the respondent physician.  		Immediately, those charges become a public record, which alone may affect a  		doctors reputation. Physicians objecting to proposed sanctions are  		legally entitled to a hearing (next stage, below) and other legal, due  		process procedural rights at hearing and in pre-hearing preparations. The  		legal work on both sides requires a substantial commitment of resources. </p>
<p>Boards charging decisions therefore receive senior input,  		typically involving staff executives, medical board members, and lawyers. In  		Virginia, for example, the Board president must agree to a staff recommendation  		to bring charges, although a single board member can authorize dropping a case.  		Even at this late stage, review of the investigative report may result in  		sending the case back for further investigation. </p>
<p>Different Board staff than those who investigate may make the final  		decision whether to prosecute and thereafter to prepare cases for prosecution  		and present evidence at hearing. Such separation may be said to promote  		independent exercise of prosecutorial discretion and to avoid any appearance of  		undue zeal or bias from the investigative stage. Not all states hand  		over responsibility in this way.</p>
<p>Once a charge is made, cases move on to the most formal stage of the  		process--usually termed prosecution.<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote41">41</a></sup> Board staff make final preparations for  		presenting the case against the physician at hearing. Prosecutorial staff may  		be in a separate administrative entity--in California, the Health Quality  		Enforcement Section of the Attorney Generals Office; in Virginia, the  		Division of Administrative Proceedings. In almost all states final decisions  		about prosecutorial strategy involve the Attorney Generals office, whose  		lawyers actually present cases at hearing.<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>Voluntary settlements with respondent physicians may occur at any time  		during this pre-hearing process. Settlement negotiations may be informal or  		there may be a formal settlement conference before hearing. Most cases are  		resolved without a hearing, and most resolutions at this stage involve some  		level of sanction (discussed further below). </p>
<h3>Adjudicative Hearing </h3>
<p>Only about 1.5% of all complaints reach a formal hearing (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>). At one time, hearings could be quite  		informal, but today such adjudicative hearings more closely resemble a non-jury  		trial in a civil court. Administrative procedures and rules of evidence are  		somewhat less elaborate than judicial ones. States follow one of two basic  		models for the main adjudicatory hearing, although the details vary  		considerably across states. In one approach the Medical Board hears evidentiary  		presentations and legal arguments on each case. In the other, an administrative  		court, presided over by an administrative law judge separate from the board  		does this. </p>
<p>Among the six study states, California and Massachusetts send cases to  		separate hearing agencies. The Massachusetts board formerly held its own  		hearings, but a legislative initiative generated by the medical society  		succeeded in moving hearings outside the agency in the late 1980s. The  		California agency, the Office of Administrative Hearings, has a specialized  		medical unit called Medical Quality Hearing Panel. The Massachusetts Division  		of Administrative Law Appeals is unspecialized and hears matters from many  		other state agencies and Boards. At the close of the evidence in Massachusetts,  		the hearing officer makes written findings of fact and law and recommends an  		outcome. The recommendation then goes back to the board, and the parties on  		both sides can make objections and suggestions. The board then decides whether  		to accept, reject, or modify the recommendation in issuing a final decision or  		order. </p>
<p>The other study states hold hearings before the Medical Board, but the  		board is assisted by a hearing officer with administrative law training. In  		some states, including Iowa, preliminary proceedings may be presided over by a  		subset of the board or by an administrative law judge, followed by full hearing  		before the full Medical Board panel.</p>
<h3>Imposition of Sanction</h3>
<p>Sanctions include prejudicial actions regarding license, other  		prejudicial actions and non-prejudicial actions. Sanctions may occur throughout  		the process, but more serious ones typically come after charging, according to  		Board managers and staff. In any case, it is the final step in the Board  		process. If imposed involuntarily after hearing, sanctions must also be upheld  		against any appeal to court. A sanctioned physician can lodge a judicial appeal  		to a statutorily designated level of state court, usually a trial court.  		Appeals are very uncommon--states typically had only a few pending, from  		multiple years of operations--but any resulting court rulings can be very  		influential. Appeals are also very costly both to pursue and to defend.</p>
<p>The Federations 2003 tally of available sanctions showed little  		variation across states (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit16">Exhibit 16</a>). All states can  		impose severe sanctions like license revocations, and all have the power to  		make stipulations or consent agreements to facilitate case settlements of  		various types. There is more variation in availability of the lower-level  		actions, including letters of concern or of censure. As already noted, states  		often lack authority to collect costs of proceedings.</p>
<p>Available sanctions vary considerably in severity. The most severe type  		involves loss or restriction of a physicians license, including  		revocations, suspension, and imposition of mandatory retirement. In the  		Federations annual tally of Board actions, these are termed  		prejudicial actions; some national experts and Board members and  		managers called them actions against the license (FSMB 2004b). Next  		in severity is what the Federation refers to as other prejudicial  		actions, such as monetary penalties or reprimands. Reprimands may be made  		public or kept private, and may vary in degree, for example, from letters of  		concern to censure. A final category tracked by the  		Federation is non-prejudicial actions, often not really sanctions,  		such as denial of a license for lack of qualification and reinstatement of  		license. </p>
<p>On average, about 10% of initial complaints result in some level of  		sanction. Rates of sanctioning are discussed further below.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="measuring" id="measuring">MEASURING DISCIPLINARY PERFORMANCE</a></h2>
<p>The nearly universal mission of Boards is to protect the publics  		health and safety. There is, however, no feasible way to measure  		regulations health impacts,<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote43">43</a></sup> so this  		project used the more managerial approach of performance measurement (Hatry  		1999, 2002; USGAO 1998). Performance measurement focuses more narrowly on the  		outputs of discipline, that is, intermediate regulatory outcomes or  		products. </p>
<p>A key question posed in all case study sites was what outputs Board  		managers intended to achieve and how they measured them. Two and only two  		outcomes were noted in all sites. The first was counting disciplinary  		sanctions. The second was closing open complaints in timely fashion and thus  		avoiding a lengthy backlog of open cases.<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote44">44</a></sup></p>
<h3>Rates of Sanctioning Physicians</h3>
<p>The main output of discipline is disciplined physicians, and the rate of  		disciplinary actions is the most publicized measure of Board activity. Board  		managers universally recognize the importance of sanction counts, and Board  		reports typically present data on numbers and types of sanctions (Massachusetts  		2004). Counts for all states are compiled annually by the Federation (FSMB  		2004b). The traditional Federation tabulation lists 16 types of sanction,  		grouped into two levels of prejudicial action and one level of other actions,  		as noted above.</p>
<p>Most sanctions taken by Boards in 2003 fell into the most severe  		category--loss or restriction of license--on average 60% or more of all actions  		(<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit17">Exhibit 17</a>). The case study Boards averaged 4.4 such  		actions per thousand physicians. Nationwide, the average for all Boards was  		similar, at 4.7 severe actions per thousand. Variation across Boards is wide.  		The top quarter of states had rates that were more than double those of the  		bottom quarter, as seen by the percentile spread. The six state study states  		showed less variation, as measured by the standard deviation of their  		distribution. (Some variation may come from states using different  		definitions of whether an informal action, like a mild letter of concern, is  		counted as an action for reporting purposes.)</p>

</tr></table><p>Non-severe prejudicial actions constituted a lower share of total  		actions, averaging about 20% in study Boards and 25% nationally. Thus, the  		study Boards average total of all prejudicial actions was 5.8 per  		thousand, versus 6.8 nationally (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit17">Exhibit 17</a>). Again  		here, there was less variation across the six study states than nationally.</p>
<p>Other actions were the smallest category, averaging about one per  		thousand, both in study states and nationally, or about 15% of all actions.  		Such actions are not mainly disciplinary in character, as described above.</p>
<p>Observing a range of action rates cannot by itself show what level is  		right, and many key informants noted that a low score does not  		capture other successes that reduce need for sanctions. Most mentioned that  		active effort to avoid licensing problem physicians is very important,  		particularly for doctors seeking to transfer into a state in mid-career. Others  		noted different efforts to address shortcomings in care, such as encouraging  		informed consumer choice among practitioners, promoting safe practice through  		development of practice guidelines and rules (including the aforementioned rule  		covering narcotic prescribing), and encouraging hospital-based attention to  		safety--all considered in more detail below. Still, most study state Board  		members, managers, and staff reported that they are interested in increasing  		their states rates of discipline.</p>
<h3>Throughput of Cases: Backlogs and Speed of  		Resolution</h3>
<p>Rates of actions taken at the end of disciplinary process may get more  		public attention, but Board managers express more concern about regularly  		moving all cases through to some resolution, often called their  		throughput. Unresolved cases can build up at various stages of  		disciplinary process.</p>
<p>Backlogs are a major concern to Board management. Boards are seen as not  		fulfilling their primary mission to protect the public if they do not take  		prompt action on a respondent physician who is perceived as not practicing  		safely. Moreover, if a patient is harmed by a physician on whom one or more  		complaints is stuck in a backlog, a Board faces very unpleasant media and  		legislative response. Even absent a scandal, backlogs may be indicative of  		underperformance obvious to any outside observer. Inquiries found that Boards  		do not generate consistent data across states on backlogs at various points in  		process. But backlogs have consistently caused problems in all states within  		the recent memory of Board managers. For example: In California in the 1990s, a  		large backlog of uninvestigated complaints led to controversial administrative  		closures without investigation (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). In Iowa, by  		2004 the backlog had reached about two years worth of investigations (Iowa  		2004), and ultimately led to substantial changes in case handling procedures.  		Massachusettss large backlog of cases by 1999 generated bad publicity, a  		crash program of catch-up review, and a change in administrative leadership  		(Massachusetts 1999). </p>
<p>Speed of completion of cases is related to successful throughput, and  		critiques of Board performance have often cited long delays before closure  		(JLARC 2000). Closure times vary considerably according to how far through the  		disciplinary process a case proceeds. Nationally, cases resolved before or  		during investigation averaged 180 days from intake to closure in 2003, 425 days  		for cases closed after investigation but before hearing, and 675 days to reach  		hearing (FSMB member survey, not presented).</p>
<p>As for other measures, speed of case resolution varies greatly within  		and across states. Most states closed a large majority of their cases quickly  		in 2003, according to their reports for the Federation's member survey. The  		typical Board's share of "quick" closures (under 180 days) was about 70% of  		total closures. However, the range was great. About a fifth of states closed  		only 20% or less of their caseload faster than 180 days. At the slower end of  		the spectrum, the typical state took longer than 360 days to close about 10% of  		its cases. For about one-fifth of reporting Boards, however, such slow closures  		constituted 60% or more of all closures. The typical Board closed about 20% of  		cases at intermediate speed (between 180 and 360 days).</p>
<h2><a name="impediments" id="impediments">IMPEDIMENTS TO DISCIPLINARY PERFORMANCE IN  		PRACTICE</a></h2>
<p>One area of inquiry for this project was what factors might inhibit  		Boards functioning (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit3">Exhibit 3</a>), and thus act as  		barriers to better Board performance or bottlenecks or chokepoints in the flow  		of cases through Boards disciplinary process. Board members and managers  		identified a variety of concerns, some specific to particular stages of  		disciplinary process and others more cross-cutting.</p>
<h3>Problems at Intake</h3>
<p>Key respondents expressed some frustration that Board complaint intake  		was not finding enough of what might be termed problem physicians  		or not finding them soon enough. Views differed on whether the issue was  		generating more complaints or getting different types of referrals. Some saw  		the level of complaints as too low and actively sought to stimulate more  		complaints by better informing the public and medical audiences about the Board  		and its complaint resolution role, but most did not. Nor do all have 800  		numbers or take anonymous complaints to stimulate submissions. </p>
<p>A contrasting view was that the important shortfall was in complaints or  		referrals from sources more expert than the general public. Respondents almost  		universally noted that most public complaints, while surely indicative of real  		consumer dissatisfaction, were inadequate indicators of quality problems and  		other failings on which Boards could take action. Acting on complaints from the  		general public, especially after alleged mistreatment or injury, also  		necessarily puts the Board in a reactive position. </p>
<p>Many key informants stated that physicians, nurses, hospitals, and other  		providers have the best information about quality problems and problem  		practitioners, and also should theoretically be able to refer a practitioner  		for discipline before patients are injured. However, it was widely believed  		that hospitals and fellow professionals underreport disciplinary or peer review  		actions taken against practitioners, and greatly underreport problems that have  		not received peer review attention. These beliefs are consistent with the  		observation that that 70% of reports to the National Practitioner Data Bank  		come from malpractice payouts rather than Medical Board or hospital  		adverse actions, and that about half of US hospitals had never  		reported a single clinical privileges action (suspension of 30 days or more)  		from the Banks inception in 1989 through 2003 (NPDB 2004).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote45">45</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One aspect of the underreporting problem is that legal mandates have not  		worked. All six case study states and almost all states nationally mandate  		reporting of possible violations of the medical practice act including  		incompetence along with all the other grounds for discipline noted above (FSMB  		2003b). About half of states provide for some level of confidentiality for  		whistle blowers who report problems, as suggested by an analysis of Boards  		published in 1987 (Kusserow et al. 1987), although in some states including two  		case study states confidentiality applies only for investigations, not if the  		physician is charged with a violation. A few states provide civil penalties for  		failure to report. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, medical professionals remain reluctant to report possible  		quality issues with one of their colleagues for a number of reasons, said case  		study respondents (see also Terry 2002a). Some mentioned medical culture or  		reluctance to conclude incompetence from observing one mistake or injury. It  		has also been suggested that fear of professional retaliation may deter some  		practitioners from reporting (Twedt 2003), while desire to retaliate may prompt  		others to report (Fellmeth 1989 suggested that Boards may receive as many  		reports based on personal animosity and hospital politics, as on  		medical performance). Similarly, hospitals are often said to be reluctant  		to conduct peer reviews or formally to discipline physicians, preferring to  		accept a voluntary departure, and even more reluctant to inform state  		authorities (e.g., Heisel and Saar 2002a, 2002b).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote46">46</a></font></sup> Both whistleblowers and institutions may  		fear litigation by reported physicians. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that Board managers and staff also described  		underreporting from police departments and the courts.</p>
<p>Boards themselves seem not to seek out intake from one potentially  		relevant source, federal Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs, formerly  		known as PROs) that perform quality reviews for Medicare. Case study  		respondents did not suggest this, and only a few Boards in 2003 had formal  		information sharing agreements with QIOs (FSMB 2003b). </p>
<p>Boards do get information about malpractice claims. Liability carriers  		are required to report paid claims to Boards in most states, and in all but one  		of the case study states (FSMB 2003b). In California, attorneys are required to  		notify the Board even before filing a malpractice lawsuit, sending it the same  		notice of intent to sue that they must send defendants, and insurers notify the  		state Board at the time they file paid-claims reports nationally (J. Fellmeth  		&amp; Papageorge 2004). The Massachusetts Board has worked with plaintiffs  		attorneys to receive regular notification of the subset of cases that may  		involve the type of gross negligence that warrants Board action for a single  		incident (Massachusetts Board 2004). </p>
<p>Since 1989, Boards have also been entitled to obtain a physicians  		record of paid malpractice claims from the federal National Practitioner Data  		Bank. Nationally, Boards make over 5,000 such queries a year (Jones 2005).  		However, each query costs five dollars, and case study respondents said that  		they could not afford to query on a routine basis.<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote47">47</a></sup> A national survey of Boards conducted by the  		Health Resources and Services Administration (an agency in HHS) found that they  		would have made 70% more queries if querying were free of charge, but it is  		unlikely that the fee will be waived for Boards (Jones 2005; Pincus 2006).</p>
<p>As with consumer complaints, getting more complaints seemed less of an  		issue than knowing how to identify which are worth detailed investigation; many  		Board managers suggested that they received far too many reports of malpractice  		payouts to investigate them all. They also noted that malpractice, even with  		patient injury, is not the same thing as incompetence. Malpractice is a  		conclusion about physician behavior in a single accident or incident, whereas  		incompetence is a continuing status of incapacity or inability. Most case study  		Boards did not even list malpractice reports as complaints, and  		California, for example, appears to close most reports routinely without  		investigation (J. Fellmeth &amp; Pagageorge 2004). When it comes to the utility  		of malpractice reports as a source of insight into physician competence, the  		perspective of those outside the Board (e.g., legislators, can be decidedly  		different) (JLARC 2000; Public Citizen 2003a).</p>
<h3>Problems in Investigation</h3>
<p>Every state reported having some recent problem with backlogs of cases  		at the investigatory stage of discipline, as already noted. Given that it is  		during this stage that Boards close about two-thirds of all cases opened, at  		some times investigators cannot close cases as fast as more are assigned to  		them.</p>
<p><i><b>Staffing and Flow of Complaints</b></i></p>
<p>One contributor to investigatory backlog is simple volume of cases per  		investigator, especially when the volume of complaints jumps or the number of  		investigators falls. One executive director noted that many cases receive  		preliminary review, perhaps including an initial interview with the doctor,  		then are set aside into a low priority queue. Another source of backlog is the  		difficulty investigators have in determining investigative priority order, as  		well as how much time each case is worth. Individual investigator preferences  		and practices also influence work flow.</p>
<p>Most cases in most states appear to be handled on a one-on-one basis.  		Each investigator decides what information is needed--from office records to  		interviews with former employees, colleagues, or neighbors--then personally  		tracks down each piece of evidence and assembles a report. Investigators must  		constantly juggle moving forward on their stock of existing cases  		as new ones arrive, some of which need to go to the head of the queue. High  		priority cases include those with significant potential for ongoing patient  		harm, but also often licensure derived cases, where a binding deadline may  		require a prompt decision. The level of oversight and coordination of  		investigations varies across states.</p>
<p>Investigators must also spend some time searching for other leads in the  		field, working from pending cases or developing new ones by following leads  		from news accounts, listening to medical personnel, or to police and other  		justice system sources. Investigators geographic assignments facilitate  		their knowing the territory in these ways. From most reports,  		investigators tasks appear to be relatively unstructured and call for  		exercising a good deal of discretion, which contributes to differences in  		approach and in activities across people and areas. Investigators need to  		be able to investigate on ones own in the field, independently seeking  		out and following leads, is one reason that executives value prior  		investigative experience in hiring new investigators. The frequent field travel  		also poses problems of managerial oversight, according to a number of Board  		managers.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote48">48</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Staffers at Medical Boards that must share investigators with other  		licensing entities often noted that investigations of physicians required  		different skills than for other licensees or that medical investigations were  		not getting sufficient attention. Few managers thought that lack of formal  		medical training was an obstacle to investigations, although some would have  		liked additional medical training for investigators. Managers mainly wanted  		investigators to obtain and bring in material for evaluation and looked to hire  		former police officers in preference to nurses, for example, in support of  		their primary roles as fact finders and not decision makers. Resource  		constraints are always perceived as an obstacle. In every state, managers felt  		shorthanded and under-funded for investigations, even though the median case  		study state devoted 59% of its resources to investigation in 2003, 10 points  		above the national median (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit9">Exhibit 9</a>). In California,  		the Enforcement Monitor reported that the long-lasting personnel freeze was  		particularly damaging to that Boards disciplinary capacity (J. Fellmeth  		&amp; Papageorge 2004)--even though California has the highest funding and most  		staff per licensee of any of those studied and might be expected to achieve  		some economies of scale. At the small end of the study scale, in Iowa, a 2005  		budgetary shortfall came on the heels of a 2004 across-the-board state cut and  		translated into the loss of 38 hours a week of compliance and supporting staff  		time--a substantial impact for a Board with only 16 employees in 2003 (Iowa  		Board 2004; FSMB 2003b).</p>
<p>There was little agreement about appropriate levels of staffing or case  		loads and standards do not exist. For example, Californias Auditor  		General asserted in 1991 that a caseload of 20 cases per investigator was  		reasonable, drawing an analogy to law enforcement agencies. The Board went on  		record in mid-decade that a caseload of 26 cases per investigator was  		unreasonably heavy (as quoted by J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004,  		pp. 42, 44). Managers in Iowa, in contrast, thought that 60 cases per person  		was quite manageable. (As noted above, California triages quality  		complaints through medical record screening and drops many quality complaints  		without sending them for field investigation, so its quality cases on average  		are presumably more consequential than those in Iowa.) </p>
<p><i><b>Difficulties in Obtaining Medical  		Records</b></i></p>
<p>Record acquisition is a constant challenge for external investigation.  		Almost any quality-related case requires records review, and Board managers and  		staff typically said that investigators request needed records on a voluntary  		basis, often with the patient-complainants authorization, but that  		compliance was often delayed. One Board manager described the problem as having  		been worse before the Board had obtained subpoena power to compel delivery of  		requested records, which was seen as a basic regulatory need. There are three  		problem aspects of record acquisition: (i)unwillingness of complainants and  		other patients to share information and of respondents to cooperate with the  		investigative process; (ii)involvement of attorneys who encourage clients and  		staff not to assist in the investigation; and (iii)that many facilities have  		contracted out the preparation of record copies, which results in increased  		costs and delays.</p>
<p>Problems accessing medical records were cited by external reviews of  		Board processes in California and Virginia (California Joint Committee 2005;  		JLARC 2000).</p>
<h3>Preparations and Prosecutions</h3>
<p>Another key focus in this project was to examine the role of physician  		discipline in quality-related cases. For these types of cases, a major hurdle  		is good access to medical expertise when Boards must make judgments about  		whether to proceed. Usually, this need arises after investigation, but  		California performs an initial medical review for potential quality-related  		cases even before field investigation. Different reviewers later advise on  		whether to prosecute a case and help prepare for prosecution. Informants  		reported backlogs at the point of expert physician review, citing insufficient  		peer review capability.</p>
<p>Some Boards use physician or nurse staffers or Board physicians for  		reviews at earlier stages of disciplinary process in lieu of outside experts,  		although outside experts are needed for actual hearing testimony.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote49">49</a></font></sup> This approach, applying  		medical expertise, makes Board decision-making very dependent upon key staff  		and Board members. In Ohio the Board Secretary (the physician chair) and  		Supervising Member (a senior lay member) read every case file and must agree on  		all prosecutions. In Virginia, any one Board member may agree to close a case,  		as already noted, but only the Chair must agree to take a case forward. This  		reliance on key members suggests that leadership is important to Board  		performance. In several states key informants noted the importance of having  		talented and engaged Board members, particularly since Board service is a part  		time position, and the workload can be substantial. A number of study  		participants noted that members face a steep learning curve to operate  		effectively in a regulatory setting. Some felt that turnover among Board  		members was too frequent, so that much time was spent bringing new members up  		to speed. </p>
<p>As a Board moves to charge and prosecute a case after investigation, the  		disciplinary process becomes much more formal. Many key informants noted that  		the involvement of lawyers slows the process. Generally, Boards are reliant on  		assistant attorneys general (AAGs) from a different state office; in some  		states the AAGs are dedicated to the Medical Board, but in others they serve  		many boards. In a number of states, disciplinary hearings are under the purview  		of agencies outside of the Board. From the perspective of several key  		informants, this involvement of other actors may delay the process. However,  		the Federation member survey does not track times past the initiation of  		hearing, so documentation of comparative times under different arrangements for  		hearing and prosecution is not available. </p>
<h3>Costs and Other Cross-Cutting Problems</h3>
<p><b><i>The High Cost of Proving Low Competence</i></b></p>
<p>High costs are a major obstacle to disciplinary throughput and,  		ultimately, prosecutions. Cost is especially high for investigation and  		prosecution of quality-related cases. Board members and managers reported that  		it is difficult to prove persistently unacceptable quality or physician  		incompetence because there are no objective, readily applicable standards to  		imply, only implicit standards that must be established and applied through  		expert peer review. One key informant noted that Boards have no objective tool  		to decide medical competence. The reason is that, with few exceptions,  		the science to develop standards to measure medical performance has been  		largely unavailable, according to the American Board of Medical  		Specialties (ABMS 2001). Thus, in order to take strong disciplinary action a  		Board must document a continuing problem or series of related problems that  		suggest a pattern of low quality. Thus the challenge, as well described by one  		participant, is distinguishing between an isolated incident and a pattern or  		way of doing business in standard of care cases. All discussants  		noted the difficulty and expense of proving substandard care through expert  		review and testimony.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote50">50</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Given the difficulty of proving low quality, Board managers and staff  		say that they often pursue other grounds for discipline that are easier to  		prove. One example cited was sanctioning a physician for not following his own  		practices established standards for prescription of pain medication.  		Another was concealing a prior hospital staff privileging action in submitting  		an application for relicensure; it was said to be easier to discipline for the  		concealment than for the underlying competence problem. Just how often such  		shifts in grounds for discipline occur is not clear.</p>
<p>A member of the projects TAG noted that Boards essentially have to  		win multiple malpractice actions simultaneously to revoke a medical license.  		Boards cannot simply rely on the fact of liability settlements or even of  		peer-review based hospital discipline, but must re-prove each case used to  		justify any disciplinary holding. Even when hospitals notify the Board of  		disciplinary action taken against a physician, they may provide little  		information other than the fact of having taken action. The Board therefore has  		to start its own case from scratch. Boards can use proceedings in other  		jurisdictions as evidence for action in their own state, but even then, a new  		hearing is typically required, in the study states as in almost all others  		(FSMB 2003b).</p>
<p>The lack of a clear standard complicates the efforts of Boards, which  		must face the issue of how many individual instances of substandard conduct  		they need to prove to impose a severe sanction like license revocation. Several  		states reported that staff at least until very recently often felt the need to  		prove the validity of ten or more complaints; one AAG recalled a decade old  		case with 40 complaints and another instance in which the hearing officer had  		limited presentation to 15. Many managers said they had sought to develop  		internal guidelines on the number of cases sufficient to support action. One  		states managers reported judicial guidance on this issue, that revocation  		was justified by a single instance of gross negligence or more than three  		instances of simple negligence. The applicable legal standard for gross  		negligence, however, called for a physicians conscious wrongdoing, so  		that in practice it was easier to wait to accumulate three instances of simple  		negligence.</p>
<p><i><b>High Costs of Legal Process</b></i></p>
<p>Many Board members and managers commented that over time their  		disciplinary process has become more legalistic. That is, staff  		perceive more need for documentation, for outside medical opinions, for having  		more formal stages in process, and above all for more frequent, earlier, and  		more thoroughgoing participation by attorneys on both sides. The participation  		of lawyers, in the view of many Boards, injects a lot of legal formality even  		into early, informal conferences meant to speed the process. Another  		states staff observed that respondents attorneys often press to  		have the Boards administrative processes resemble the more extensive  		procedural traditions of criminal law. These developments are perceived as  		burdensome in staff time and calendar time. At the same time, staff often noted  		that respondent physicians are entitled to traditional due process protections  		against arbitrary decisions and that taking extra effort can improve the  		visible quality of evidence and create a record available for external  		accountability. Clearly, both sides perceive that high stakes are involved in  		any disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Sometimes, more elaborate process has resulted from legislative  		enactments. Most notably, the California legislature has passed numerous  		strictures over time, in a way seeking to impose more discipline on a  		disciplinary agency perceived not to be pushing cases hard enough. Rarely, a  		court decision changes how Boards operate. The notable example for these states  		was a Washington Supreme Court decision that put a higher burden of proof on  		that states disciplinary process.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the regulatory environment has changed substantially in the  		last decade, giving discipline a much higher profile than it traditionally had.  		This is literally true since almost all states have posted physician profiles  		on the internet starting with Massachusetts in 1996, on which more below.  		Patients have also become much more sensitized to potential physician problems  		(Blendon et al. 2002), in part because of the publicity generated by the  		patient safety movement (Leape et al. 1996) and the recent medical  		litigation crisis (Albert 2002). Moreover, health insurers have  		moved to coverage favoring a network of preferred providers (Gabel  		et al. 2000), and the risk of delisting raises the stakes for respondent  		physicians facing disciplinary inquiries. Finally, the Boards themselves have  		come under considerable public scrutiny amidst concerns that too few doctors  		are disciplined; pushing for stronger sanctions naturally moves disciplinary  		cases further along the spectrum toward more formal legal process.</p>
<p>As one administrative law judge explained, medical cases are fully  		litigated, and respondent counsel often come in with plans for  		rehabilitation and new support systems for respondent doctors to propose in  		lieu of disciplinary sanction. They also bring in outside experts, prompting  		AAGs to respond in kind. More formal legal process creates direct costs in the  		form of higher attorneys' fees, which are untabulated. An observed indirect  		effect is the tendency for both sides to more closely hold onto available  		information, making disciplinary processes slower and more costly in staff time  		and other resources.</p>
<p><i><b>Dollar Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>Reliable information on just how much per case Boards must spend to  		prosecute quality-related disciplinary actions is not available. Executive  		directors all reported that they could not track costs per case, although most  		expressed interest in generating such management information. Such expenses are  		spread across two or more administrative entities (the Board itself and the  		Attorney Generals office, plus additional divisions for umbrella Boards)  		and relevant information resides on multiple data bases. Moreover, their  		accounting systems typically do not track staff time or other expenses by  		case.</p>
<p>Directors were asked instead to describe one or more recent fully  		contested cases involving clinical quality and to estimate the costs involved.  		Three respondents gave the round figure of $100,000 as an estimate (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit18">Exhibit 18</a>).<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote52">52</a></sup> Other  		estimates were substantially lower. As one respondent noted, costs vary  		all over the place depending on the precise circumstances of a  		case.</p>

</tr></table><p>Many managers and other participants commented on the cost of hiring  		outside experts, several noting an hourly fee in their state of about $150,  		well below rates in medical litigation cases. In another state the Board  		evidently had a worse problem, in one recent year being unable to afford any  		payment whatsoever for outside experts. Other cost drivers include internal  		legal and other staff time, which runs into weeks and months as well as  		substantial staff down time waiting for reviews. </p>
<p>Some managers said that quality-related cases were becoming more complex  		over time, often because the medical procedures were new or more practitioners  		were involved. Occasionally they involved multiple medical partners as  		respondents and needed reviewers from multiple specialties--a very expensive  		occurrence.</p>
<p>High expense for proving low quality practice is not unique to medical  		boards. Legal and associated costs related to medical litigation account for  		over half of all claims costs, counting both sides together. Nationwide payouts  		in 2003 averaged some $295 thousand per paid physician claim (NPDB 2003),  		implying total investigational/prosecution/defense expenses of well over $100  		thousand per case. Discussions with hospital executives suggest that the costs  		of contested hospital disciplinary actions are also very high.</p>
<p><i><b>Access to Medical Expertise</b></i></p>
<p>In four of the six states, executive directors named prompt access to  		expert physicians one of the top three factors impeding effective discipline.  		High costs were noted as the main reason. Boards can no longer rely on  		inexpensive access to their own members for all or most medical input. Outside  		peer reviewers are needed because the volume of cases and number of specialties  		involved is so great, and attorneys and courts prefer to see outside input.  		Peer reviewers are expensive if a Board tries to come close to prevailing  		rates, and where payment is small or lacking, timeliness is a problem. In  		California, for example, it was reported that the Board often ran short of  		pre-qualified experts, and cited low payment rates, which affect the  		Boards ability to compete for the best experts. (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Papageorge 2004, p.ES-28). Other states pay even lower rates than California;  		one Board reported frequent reliance on volunteer reviewers. In at least one  		state, peer reviewers must be in active medical practice, although managers  		believe that they can use recently retired physicians for screening  		reviews.</p>
<p>Moreover, cost is not the only reason that Boards have difficulties  		accessing sufficient numbers of medical experts. As a number of staff and  		observers noted, many professionals still feel reluctant to investigate much  		less testify against a colleague or even fellow physician. The difficulty is  		most severe in smaller jurisdictions and smaller subspecialties, such as  		pediatric neurosurgery or pain management. Boards can face the problem that no  		in-area reviewer is available with the same expertise as a respondent physician  		who does not know or have business relations with that respondent. Moreover,  		some medical experts are not adept at interfacing with the legal system.</p>
<p><i><b>Difficulties in Finding and Prosecuting Quality of  		Care Cases</b></i></p>
<p>Outside observers have long complained that very few Board sanctions  		address lack of competence (Derbyshire 1974, 1979; USDHHS 1986).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote53">53</a></font></sup> Most Board sources also acknowledged that  		quality problems in the field went far beyond the complaints they received,  		most of which do not support any action. The quality-related share of sanctions  		has risen over time, according to the Federation. Project staff asked state  		Boards executive directors what share of complaints were related to  		clinical quality, defining them as standard of care cases that  		usually involve expert medical witnesses. </p>
<p>Five states were able to respond, citing figures from 25% to 51%. These  		levels were surprisingly high, given the prior literature. Comparisons across  		states are not presented, as some informants were citing specifics from their  		published reports, whereas others were estimating. Moreover, as already noted,  		states differ in their categorizations of complaints and of grounds for  		discipline.</p>
<p>Three states also provided information on what share of sanctions  		related to quality. Here the range was lower, from 7% to 19%.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote54">54</a></font></sup> There is not a one to one  		correspondence between complaints and sanctions. Multiple complaints may be  		consolidated into a single case against the respondent physician, and one case  		can result in more than one sanction. </p>
<p>One reason that quality cases constitute a lower share of sanctions than  		of complaints might be that it is harder to prove quality deficiencies, so that  		quality cases are disproportionately dropped or resolved with a minor action.  		Also, as noted previously, Boards often try to discipline a physician perceived  		to have quality problems on a different ground that is easier to prove. Another  		plausible explanation for the drop off in quality percentage is that patient  		complainants are not able to discern poor clinical quality or incompetence as  		readily as other physician performance issues.</p>
<p><i><b>Quality of Staff</b></i></p>
<p>One experienced state official observed that recruitment and  		retention problems plague personnel management, especially in that  		experienced investigators leave for better paying positions (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Pagageorge 2004). None of the executive directors cited such personnel problems  		as a key barrier or chokepoint, but some did mention occasional difficulties.  		Some noted problems in staffing or maintaining productivity of investigators in  		the field. One noted that the office of the Attorney General has a staff  		turnover problem because of its high work load. It should also be noted that in  		two of the six study states executive directors left their positions during the  		two years of the study. </p>
<p>Several managers operating within umbrella boards noted that the larger  		scale of operations from combining many boards gave staff more options for  		advancement, a career ladder lacking within the typical sized Medical Board.  		Larger entities can also create specialized positions like research analyst.  		Half of the countrys Medical Boards have 14 or fewer staff, according to  		2003 Federation data (2003b). </p>
<p><i><b>Weak Data Systems</b></i></p>
<p>Most managers identified limitations of the data systems on which they  		had to rely for tracking disciplinary cases and other management purposes. In  		only one state did the executive director express full satisfaction with the  		existing system. Identified weaknesses included the following: </p>
<ol><li>Boards data systems are simply too old, often referred to by  		  users as obsolete.</li>
<li>Boards have to rely on multiple legacy systems for different  		  purposes. Information is not integrated across various regulatory functions or  		  across time. Quantitative questions posed during this project were usually  		  answerable, but only through mini-research projects by a user knowledgeable  		  about all the systems. Managers want integrated data that combines licensure  		  and disciplinary information and also includes management information such as  		  operational status of a complaint, which staff member is handling it, staffing  		  time spent, and expenses. </li>
<li>Data entry is inflexible. For example, data fields were often too  		  small and automated categories too constraining; sometimes typographical errors  		  could not be corrected locally, only centrally. Working with systems could  		  require brute force workarounds. Similarly, another state had no  		  edits for quality control, and, for example, any date entered is  		  accepted. Others said that it was difficult to enter data on a case that moved  		  forward toward resolution then back into investigation rather than only  		  forward. Another weakness was lack of cross-references between related entries,  		  across types of reporters or across time.</li>
<li>Users have limited ability to query for information.  		  Traditional data bases do not facilitate simple phrasing of data queries or ad  		  hoc specifications of information requests as distinct from standardized ones;  		  thus, special programming was get needed to get information out of the  		  system.</li>
</ol><p>Different states emphasized slightly different issues (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit19">Exhibit 19</a>). Several states were moving to better systems  		as of the last round of case study interaction in mid-2005. Over time, several  		have found that making upgrades for data systems is challenging. One system  		typically has to serve multiple boards, even multiple agencies, causing delays  		in decision making and compromises about capabilities and features. Typically,  		a separate administrative entity makes the final decisions about IT purchases  		and also manages the upgrade. One states managers reported that a new IT  		system was supposed to have been completed by the end of calendar 1999, but the  		first set of vendors failed, and a second upgrade was in process. The  		California Boards Consumer Affairs System mainframe computer  		program has been described as so antiquated that the Board is forced to  		track some information manually or with additional small database  		programs (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2005, p. 45).<sup><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote55">55</a></sup></p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>Fragmentation and Discontinuities in Disciplinary  		Process</b></i></p>
<p>Many entities are involved in the course of discipline. Experience in  		two states illustrated some problems that can result. A detailed examination of  		the California Board in the 1980s cited this fragmented and  		cumbersome structure as a key weakness (R. Fellmeth 1989). In most  		case study states, operations remain somewhat fragmented, in every case because  		of the separate organization of the Attorney Generals office, and often  		because investigations or hearings are held separately (in California,  		investigations are run out of regional district offices). Fragmentation  		complicates orderly progress of disciplinary process, creates delays as one  		actor must wait for another to act, impedes unified management of case flow,  		and raises costs.</p>
<p>Washington State (2004b) had just completed an internal review of its  		own disciplinary process at the time of this study. A key observation was that  		many hands had to handle a case from inception to completion, which dilutes any  		staffers sense of ownership of a case and also diminishes  		accountability for case management. Some re-learning has to occur after each  		handoff of responsibility, and multiple handoffs increase the  		likelihood that someone will lose track of a case or omit some action that will  		later require patching up. Further, although the process is meant to be linear  		(as presented above), in fact numerous circularities are built in. Newly  		responsible staff at a later stage not uncommonly ask for more or different  		information than was generated by a predecessor. Requests for more information  		were found to be especially likely once a case was assigned to an AAG for final  		preparation for hearing. </p>
<p><i><b>The Reactiveness and Narrow Focus of  		Complaint-Driven Discipline</b></i></p>
<p>Managers frequently noted the issue of always having to react to  		complaints rather than take systematic action to promote the safe and effective  		medical practice they saw as their mission. The limitations of this approach  		are numerous, most notably that it is not an efficient way of addressing poor  		quality (or the converse, ensuring good quality). Furthermore, it is resource  		intensive and often the complainants and the issues they raise do not reflect  		typical practice. The narrow focus of complaint resolution also drew mention.  		For example, it was observed that trying to establish a causal connection  		between an individual practitioner and untoward outcomes makes it very hard to  		understand the larger context of the apparent problem, including the  		practitioners history within a hospital, or the insurance plan applicable  		to care. </p>
<p><i><b>Regulatory Capture of Boards by the  		Regulated Profession</b></i></p>
<p>Another commonly cited barrier to effective discipline is that  		professional influence, especially by state medical societies might prevent  		boards from taking effective action or may appear to make board members or  		staff more practitioner-friendly than patient-oriented. This perspective was,  		understandably, more commonly expressed by outsiders than by Board staff or  		members. Outside analysis of the California Board suggests that it has changed  		from an old boys club to a more willing regulator (compare R.  		Fellmeth 1989 with J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). </p>
<p>Discussants recognized the difficulties of resisting political pressure  		and maintaining regulatory autonomy for a Board and staff, which are viewed as  		crucial to regulatory success. While there may be many reasons why the  		organized medical community in any given state is not supportive of strong  		discipline, it was hypothesized by participants that medical society leadership  		composition and philosophy differ radically from the broad population of  		physicians. By expressing dislike of any incursion into professional autonomy,  		including state regulation, managed care, or malpractice liability,  		organizations in this view have become more trade associations than  		professional societies devoted to education or advancement of professional  		norms.</p>
<p>One point of influence of the organized medical community is the  		nominating process for Board members, in which medical societies retain some  		role, though much less than historically.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote56">56</a></font></sup> Another is the legislative battle over  		Boards budgets or other statutory change (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge  		2004; Robeznieks 2002a). Less direct influence may occur through cooperation on  		obtaining peer review, running a diversion program, or disseminating  		educational materials.</p>
<p><i><b>Competing Goals</b></i></p>
<p>A final reason that a Board may be less than maximally assertive in  		disciplining doctors is that Boards must consider countervailing concerns.  		Their need to provide due process to respondent doctors has already been  		mentioned. This requirement may be written into a Boards mission, but in  		any case American legal norms call for due process as a matter of fairness and  		promoting accountability by regulators. Indeed, some courts may even make a  		physicians right to practice a more fundamental right than public  		protection.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote57">57</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Other competing interests have more practical or policy related roots.  		Patients may see regulatory intervention as reducing their access to care. Many  		key informants cited this consideration in discussing the tradeoff between  		zealously enforcing narcotics laws and allowing efficacious pain management for  		severely ill patients. Others noted that the same issue arises for alternative  		therapies, which have earned differing degrees of acceptance by mainstream  		practitioners; patients may actively seek out such alternatives even though  		overall clinical support for them is limited. Still others noted the use of  		nurse practitioners or other limited practitioners who might be seen as  		pushing the boundary of their scope of practice in order to bring  		some care to rural patients.</p>
<h2><a name="improving" id="improving">IMPROVING DISCIPLINE: EFFECTIVE PRACTICES AND  		INNOVATIONS OF INTEREST</a></h2>
<p>The literature review and case studies sought to identify practices that  		many key informants and others cited as effective or potentially effective in  		achieving improvements in discipline. The main benchmark of effectiveness was  		the informed opinions of case study participants, along with some internal  		measures of performance. External benchmarks are lacking, as noted above, as  		are good ways to measure health or safety impacts, much less to tie them to  		particular practices or innovations of Boards. The literature and case study  		participants also discussed some innovations of some interest but not in  		general use.</p>
<h3>Process Change and Improved Management</h3>
<p><b><i>Intake</i></b></p>
<p>Almost all case study managers and staff thought that the intake of  		complaints could be improved. Some spoke of outreach to consumers through such  		means as having a toll free phone line or giving presentations around the  		state. A number of people noted that better web pages and physician profiling  		online had increased public awareness about their Board. One state reported  		having done a survey.</p>
<p>Board respondents felt even more strongly that intake would be improved  		if hospital staff and others with better knowledge about medical quality were  		to file more reports on problem physicians. No one, however, had a good way to  		improve on what they perceived as a low level of compliance with mandatory  		reporting statutes. One executive director described spending a year educating  		physicians, nurses, and hospital staff. That effort did succeed in quadrupling  		the number of reports; however it was only a modest increase from eight to 32  		reports a year.</p>
<p><i><b>Triage and Prioritization for  		Investigation</b></i></p>
<p>Good prioritization of complaints was very frequently cited as an  		effective practice. Most states created ways to drop low-priority cases, to  		fast-track high-priority cases, and to assign a priority level to those in the  		middle for standard investigation. Managers perceived it especially important  		to identify quality-related cases quickly, as they are both important and  		resource intensive.</p>
<p>It is not practical to investigate every complaint, and investigative  		staff benefit from being able to focus on more serious cases. All the study  		states concluded that effective practice calls for dropping some cases as below  		the threshold needed to justify investigation before they can accumulate into a  		backlog. Among the case study states, Iowa was the last to develop a mechanism  		for such administrative closure. There, historical practice was to  		investigate every case, a practice evidently thought appropriate by the  		Attorney Generals office. This view shifted before this projects  		last case study interaction, by which time the Board had created a new  		pre-investigation screening committee of a medical person, a lawyer/negotiator,  		and the head of investigations. All the states now have some such  		mechanism.</p>
<p>Closure is not the only alternative to field investigation. California  		attempts to handle some complaints by immediate cease and desist  		orders or citations and others, for example involving criminal convictions, by  		immediate referral to the Attorney Generals office (California Board  		2004).</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, all the states have some mechanism for  		fast-tracking certain complaints, which all see as an important public  		protection in obviously high-profile cases with potential for ongoing harm to  		the public. These mechanisms vary by state, and it is unclear what share of  		cases qualify or how much more quickly they are handled. For ordinary  		investigations, three states sought to improve consistency and efficiency by  		formally assigning priority levels for investigation. California, Ohio, and  		Washington have such procedures, which they believed helpful. Some level of  		medical screening for quality cases is effectively a form of triage as well.  		</p>
<p>All these triage methods rely on complaint review by an individual or  		committee to categorize a complaint according to how its circumstances match  		the applicable verbal formulae. The California Monitor has proposed also giving  		weight to the source of the complaint; that is, seeking to emphasize  		investigations of types of complaints found most likely to yield results.</p>
<p><i><b>Management Timelines and Other  		Protocols</b></i></p>
<p>Half of the study states have formal management timelines by which  		Boards can measure the progress of cases through disciplinary process--for  		example, 60 days for intake and screening or 180 to complete a routine  		investigation. In California, investigatory target times are directed by  		statute; in Virginia and Washington State by the umbrella board for all covered  		professions discipline. The other states use only internal rules of thumb  		and seek to promote timeliness mainly though hands-on management of  		investigations and other components of disciplinary process. Investigators may  		have to file a case management plan for each case, for example, which then  		benchmarks performance. One state manager described weekly meeting between the  		director of enforcement and each investigator attorney team, also monthly  		meetings on very old cases, for example. The management timelines are seen as  		somewhat artificial but still useful markers for internal management and  		external accountability. In terms of effectiveness, it bears noticing that  		times are conceded often to exceed the guidelines.</p>
<p>States also typically face legal timelines set by statute or regulation  		as part of due process protections for doctors being prosecuted, for instance  		that a physician must have 30 days to respond to a charge. Some legal timelines  		are perceived as unrealistic and in one state are often waived by agreement of  		the parties.</p>
<p>In addition to timelines, some Boards have developed protocols to  		identify and resolve certain high-volume types of minor cases without field  		investigation. For example, one state reported that medical records release  		complaints are handled in house by communications staff. Some Boards use  		informal protocols to guide decisions; one executive director noted as an  		example of an automatic close that a complaint file was opened only  		because Medicaid had sanctioned a provider--but that Medicaid itself based its  		action on prior Board action.</p>
<p><i><b>Coordination across Stages of  		Discipline</b></i></p>
<p><u>Investigator Attorney Teamwork</u></p>
<p>An essential element for coordination in a discipline case is the  		relationship between the investigators and managers who decide what cases to  		advance into prosecution and the lawyers who must prepare and present any  		prosecutorial case at hearing. Almost all senior managers supported closer  		relationships at an earlier stage than prosecution, working across the  		traditionally separate stages of disciplinary process.</p>
<p>Massachusetts, for example, often uses a team approach for  		investigations, particularly on complicated or emergency cases  		(Massachusetts Board 2003, p. 15). Teams may include investigators, nurse  		investigators, and their supervisors along with paralegals and in-house  		lawyers. Investigator lawyer teams are immediately assigned for all allegations  		of sexual misconduct. Other states also attempt to form integrated  		teams--sometimes referred to as SWAT or rapid response teams<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote58">58</a></font></sup>--for challenging cases.  		Involving the attorney as soon as the matter is referred to investigation is  		meant to avoid duplication of effort or the need for subsequently referring a  		matter back for further investigation that could have been more efficiently  		conducted the first time.</p>
<p>Teamwork is more difficult to achieve across the line of demarcation  		between Boards and offices of the Attorney General, even though individual  		Assistant Attorneys General are often assigned in whole or in part to the  		Medical Board. In one state an AAG reported positive results from earlier  		involvement in disciplinary investigations, noting that preparatory time was  		cut from over a month to under a week. In 1997 California moved some dedicated  		AAGs into field offices to help during investigations, called the Deputy in  		District Office (DIDO) system. DIDO improved upon the prior handoff  		model of investigation and prosecution, and the state is moving toward even  		closer coordination (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004).</p>
<p><u>Administrative Centralization</u></p>
<p>Managers in several states spoke in favor of more centralized management  		of cases as a way to reduce fragmentation of responsibility and a large number  		of handoffs as a case moves through traditional disciplinary stages  		of process. This approach appears to be most advanced in Washington State,  		building upon its internal disciplinary process review (Washington 2004b). The  		managerial goal is functional coordination of all disciplinary  		activities--including investigative, legal, and compliance work. As an umbrella  		agency for multiple boards, the agency wants to create common practices and  		depth of staff across professional boards to respond to major caseload  		increases or staffing issues. This larger scope also permits managers to cross  		train staff and to create teams of various specialists, which can be  		particularly important where a respondent holds multiple credentials. Larger  		scope also offers a larger and more diverse career ladder for staff that is not  		available in a very small Board. Senior managers at umbrella boards say that  		this approach facilitates achieving consistent results and allows them to set  		more measurable performance objectives; they believe that they are making  		progress in process improvement. Unfortunately, the problems of poor  		coordination are better documented than the success of better coordination  		(e.g., J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004). While centralization might appear  		easier with an umbrella agency, both Virginia and Washington State report  		ongoing challenges with coordination.</p>
<p><i><b>Managerial Capacity</b></i></p>
<p>A related practice is expanding managerial staff to oversee the key  		processes of investigation and peer review for quality-related cases. Board  		managers found this approach useful for avoiding backlogs and assuring that  		higher priority cases are identified and pursued. Iowa, Massachusetts, and  		Virginia all hired new staff to oversee investigations or peer review. Ohio did  		not increase staff but in recent years, its Medical Board secretary (physician  		chair) and supervising member (layperson) reportedly made themselves more  		available to Board staff, reading every case file. Their coordination with  		staff provided real-time training and managerial oversight for staff and also  		expanded medical capacity.</p>
<p><i><b>Guidelines for Sanctions</b></i></p>
<p>Many case study participants spoke in favor of making sanctions more  		consistent through guidelines. In California disciplinary  		guidelines are required by statute<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote59">59</a></font></sup> and govern the recommendations of hearing  		judges. In Washington State, case disposition criteria apply across professions  		and are used after investigation to determine appropriate action, including  		notice of correction, informal disposition and formal charges (Washington State  		2004a). In Ohio, standards are embodied in a non-binding position  		statement (Ohio Board 2002).</p>
<p>Virginia appears to have a well-developed scheme. Its Board scores both  		the seriousness of offense (including nature of offense, extent of harm done,  		and continuing risk of further harm) as well as respondent factors (such as  		prior record). Scoring is based on weights developed through analysis of prior  		decision making. The scores are entered into a matrix that generates a single  		value, which is then subject to adjustment based on aggravating or mitigating  		circumstances. Where the Board decides to vary from the scheduled sanction, it  		provides an explanation that can be used for later reevaluation of the scaling  		factors (Virginia Board 2004; see also Kauder &amp; Carter 2004). Another state  		decides on the level of sanctions separately from finding disciplinary  		violations, in order to facilitate consistency across cases.</p>
<p><i><b>Assessing Quality of Boards  		Decision-Making</b></i></p>
<p>One executive director suggested that a Boards biggest  		challenge is to measure its quality of decision-making, for  		example, in triaging complaints and deciding on prosecution and sanctions, a  		sentiment echoed by another states executive director. They and others  		elsewhere spoke of the need for self-evaluation, but also its difficulty. There  		was, however, little active review of cases, no consensus about the most  		effective approach, and little managerial time available to devise approaches.  		The Washington Board does conduct random internal audits of its credentialing,  		a far more routinized process than discipline.</p>
<p>Some Board members and managers recognized value in having to undergo  		sunset review before their legislatures, which brought new  		perspectives on efficiency and effectiveness of operations. In two states,  		outsiders audited case files for quality of decision making. California  		conducted a very thoroughgoing assessment of performance through its  		Enforcement Monitor. The California Board faced two audits of its case closures  		in the early 1990s, and significant deficiencies were found (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Papageorge 2004). Virginia faced similar investigation by a legislative audit  		committee in the late 1990s (JLARC 2000). </p>
<p>Another form of feedback was a consumer satisfaction survey done in  		California as part of sunset review (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004).  		Massachusetts also conducted a customer satisfaction survey of physicians about  		its licensure process and did usability studies of its website, which was a  		pioneer of physician profiling.</p>
<h3>Medical Expertise</h3>
<p>Effective processing of quality-related complaints calls for sufficient  		access to medical expertise, according to all Board managers and observers. All  		thought that more support for additional medical expertise is an effective use  		of resources. Medical capacity was described as particularly important at two  		stages. The first is screening and oversight of complaints and investigations,  		usually done in house. The second is peer review of cases for  		active prosecution, usually done by outside consultants.</p>
<p><i><b>In-House Capacity</b></i></p>
<p>Virginia was unique among the six states in having a physician as  		executive director of its Medical Board, under the umbrella Department of  		Health Professions.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote60">60</a></font></sup> In recent years, the board added a second  		physician as medical review coordinator. They agreed that it is very useful to  		have two sets of physician eyes on staff even before drawing upon  		their Medical Board President. Having a colleague creates a synergistic effect,  		and an extra person helps cope with sheer volume. Iowa managers said that even  		a lay coordinator could effectively monitor and cajole peer review physicians,  		and that this new position was very productive. One other states  		executive director was giving consideration to hiring a physician, funds  		permitting.</p>
<p>Massachusetts and Ohio use staff nurse reviewers to screen cases for  		potential referral to peer review. Iowa, however, has rejected nurse reviewers  		on the ground that their reviews could not be kept confidential; the state peer  		review shield law would not prevent litigants from obtaining copies  		for use in malpractice or other lawsuits, unlike physician peer reviews.  		California relies on in-house medical consultants and sometimes  		external expert consultants to screen quality cases, even before going to field  		investigation. Washington at the time of the case study similarly used  		physician assistants to screen complaints through medical records review; that  		practice was halted in the wake of an August 2005 judicial decision.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote61">61</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most states also appear to rely on their board members for at least some  		medical screening. Most managers noted that winning active participation of  		board members was important, especially for screening, allowing a greater  		volume of cases to be screened.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote62">62</a></font></sup> Indeed, many executive directors  		described relations with a few key board members as functioning much like an  		executive committee between meetings of the full board. Ohio has standardized  		this relationship through heavy reliance on its secretary and supervising  		member, who by statute oversee enforcement activities. They have for some years  		made themselves readily available to staff, meeting twice a month for two days  		each time, and make decisions at key points. This interaction not only provides  		staff with expert medical help but also increases accountability for their  		staff work. Some managers asserted that better Board pay or additional members  		would support more reviews as well as more frequent meetings.</p>
<p><i><b>Contracting Out</b></i></p>
<p>Massachusetts began outsourcing screening of most quality  		cases to cope with an emergency backlog of cases in 2000. Through a  		competitive process, managers selected the Center for Health Dispute Resolution  		(CHDR) to review cases alleging substandard care.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote63">63</a></font></sup> CHDR is paid per case for expert peer  		reviews and liaises with the senior Board nurse. CHDR supplies only the  		expertise needed when it is needed, without the possible down time  		of in-house staff. The contract calls for each case to be reviewed by a nurse,  		then a physician within the specialty. A named signatory takes responsibility  		for each review. Occasionally, CHDR has provided expert witnesses for a  		prosecuted case, for which it receives additional payment, but the Board much  		prefers to use in-state experts. Board members and managers were very satisfied  		with this arrangement. It avoids potential conflicts of interest, holds down  		costs, provides timely response, and very coherent case summaries. This  		contracting out for quality screening turned the tide for the Board  		in terms of efficiency and case flow, according to the executive director.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional Pools of Experts</b></i></p>
<p>States could also deal with occasional difficulties finding a specialist  		peer reviewer in state--which sometimes occurred even in the larger states--by  		forming a regional pool with their neighbors. No state had participated in one,  		but a number of case study participants thought a pool was a good idea; some  		non-study state managers at the 2005 Federation annual meeting reported that  		pooling was under consideration. Some participants reported informal ways of  		finding experts through sister Boards in other states, including use of Exec  		Net, a broadcast email service of Administrators in Medicine, the association  		of executive directors. In one state, however, there was resistance to any use  		of hired guns who cross borders to testify.</p>
<h3>Efficiency and Targeting Resources</h3>
<p>Most Boards in this era were striving to improve regulatory outputs even  		as staff cuts were required (Washington 2004a). Better information technology  		was universally seen as a key to improving efficiency. All managers strongly  		believed that better IT would allow them to improve performance through ongoing  		monitoring and feedback. As already noted, no state had operational IT systems  		that fully met their regulatory needs as executive directors and other users  		saw them. Two states were in advanced stages of implementing improvements.</p>
<p>Better IT was a high priority use for any available new funding, as  		already noted (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit11">Exhibit 11</a>). What managers all  		described, in varying ways, was a form of relational data base with several key  		attributes:</p>
<ul><li>integrated across all Board activities;</li>
<li>user friendly;</li>
<li>flexible enough for various types of data to be entered--including  		  information that does not fit predefined categories;</li>
<li>easily searchable with simple query language rather than detailed  		  programming; and</li>
<li>able to generate various types of output for multiple uses.</li>
</ul><p>Electronic complaint records were expected to improve quality of  		performance, much as electronic patient records can enhance clinical care and  		public health (Gingrich and Merritt 2005). Having more data handling capacity  		is expected to encourage keeping and tracking more types of data, such as  		information on below threshold complaints that are routinely closed  		without investigation, but a pattern of which might indicate a larger problem.  		Managers and staff in one state with a recently improved IT system said that  		they did track such cases.</p>
<p><i><b>Indicators of Effectiveness</b></i></p>
<p>IT was expected to improve performance across stages of disciplinary  		process, from targeting investigations to post-disciplinary monitoring of  		licensee compliance, and improved computer hardware and software were clearly  		central to various other performance management improvements also noted.</p>
<p><u>Economies Achieved through Automation</u></p>
<p>The most frequently mentioned example of the virtues of automation was  		computerization of licensure tasks. Most of the Boards in recent years have  		automated routine activities of licensure and have encouraged licensees to  		submit applications online rather than by paper documents that require that  		Board staff input the information, which adds cost and some errors. As noted  		above, Iowa even lowers fees for online applicants.</p>
<p>Several informants also praised the practice of scanning documents that  		they must file and of sending pre-meeting paperwork to board  		members by compact disc rather than in hard copy. Even though such CDs are only  		scans, not fully searchable documents, noted one states executive  		director, the CDs can have bookmarks that facilitate finding  		material within them.</p>
<p>All described such automation as an efficient method of data storage and  		retrieval, which freed up staff, storage, and postage budgets for reallocation,  		mainly to disciplinary tasks. In other cases, managers anticipated useful  		outputs not yet readily available. For example, managers were keenly aware of  		the constant need to hold down costs and operate more efficiently. They  		generally regretted their current inability to track costs per case in real  		time, for example.</p>
<p><u>Targeted Enforcement</u></p>
<p>Many key informants anticipated that better IT would enable them to  		track trends in existing data so as to target available resources where they  		could do the most good. They felt that they could address many issues of  		interest with existing capabilities, but not easily or in real time. More data  		capacity was expected to allow more benchmarking, so as to target outliers for  		investigation or other action. The leading example cited was focusing on  		repeat offenders, physicians with multiple malpractice or  		disciplinary activity over a period of years. The Massachusetts Board has begun  		to compile information across multiple disciplinary complaints (or malpractice  		claims) to find patterns of a problem when no one complaint in isolation would  		appear serious. It has published a compilation of data suggesting that three  		paid malpractice claims in ten years is a good indicator of a problem  		physician. In response, it has adopted a policy of automatically performing a  		clinical review of such physicians (Massachusetts Board 2004). Other case study  		informants recommended such activity as well.</p>
<p>The California Enforcement Monitor analyzed the extent to which  		different categories of complaints or reports led to action. The analysis found  		that consumer initiated complaints were rarely even referred for field  		investigation (unlike in other states). In contrast, several other types of  		reports were much more likely to have been found worthy of follow-up--including  		those from hospital peer review, malpractice carriers, coroners, self-reporting  		by physicians, medical and osteopathic boards in other states, other government  		agencies, and local police or sheriffs departments. The latter type of  		high yield complaints was urged to get more attention (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Pagageorge 2004).</p>
<p>It should be noted that additional IT capabilities in the absence of  		other important resources might not generate the same results. As one example,  		the California analysis was more recently advanced in large part because the  		state funded the position of an external Enforcement Monitor who had long  		experience with regulatory boards and good cooperation in accessing information  		from within the various components of Californias process (J. Fellmeth  		&amp; Papageorge 2004, 2005).</p>
<p><u>Persuasiveness of Data Analysis</u></p>
<p>The California Monitors report highlighted the availability of  		analyzable data as a major reason that its 2004 report could improve upon its  		predecessors efforts of 15 years before (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge  		2004; R. Fellmeth 1989). In 1989, the Board had not maintained good data nor  		automated what it did have.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote64">64</a></font></sup> More recently, even the rather primitive  		data capabilities available to the Monitor allowed that office to generate  		numerous useful recommendations. Moreover, the recommendations carried great  		weight not only within the Board and the office of the Attorney General but  		also in the state legislature, and a great many recommendations made in late  		2004 became official practice or state law by the next fall (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Papageorge 2005).</p>
<p>Massachusettss recent success in raising its budget also came  		after the Board undertook higher tech and more analytical approaches to the  		problem of frequent offenders, as noted above, and to online profiling  		(considered below). More prosaic successes were also involved--closing  		backlogged cases and getting support from the medical society.</p>
<p><i><b>Staffing and Leadership</b></i></p>
<p>Many case study participants spoke of the need to attract and retain  		good quality staff, which was a focus for the California Monitors writing  		as well (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004).<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote65">65</a></font></sup> Most managers felt generally successful  		in their staffing, though many commented on the challenges of managing within  		public sector personnel practices.</p>
<p>Maintaining or increasing investigative staff was identified as a  		particular need in many states. A frequent goal was to return to earlier ratios  		of staff to workload (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2004; Washington State  		2004a). Having field investigators with full medical credentials in nursing or  		another health profession was not generally seen as an effective practice. Most  		but not all key informants emphasized medical capacity at a supervisory or  		review level instead. Similarly, some but not all thought that additional  		medical training for investigators would pay off in better performance.</p>
<p>All Board managers, however, believed that more staff would aid  		productivity. Of course, almost any manager would like to have more staff, but  		the case study found some indications of improved performance from enhanced  		staffing. Almost all the case study states successfully reduced backlog with  		greater dedication of resources, sometimes with a temporary push by  		senior management, either during the study period or in prior years. Some  		non-case study states in this era also added resources and staff to reduce  		backlogs (Adams 2003, 2004b).</p>
<p>Moreover, two of the six study states, Massachusetts and Virginia, had  		notable increases of resources during the timeframe of this study, and their  		experiences lend support to the efficacy of increased resources. The evidence  		from Massachusetts is qualitative. After licensure fees were increased in 2002,  		the Board could expand its use of external peer reviewers. Virginia tracked  		output more directly. The Board planned for an increase in complaints in  		2003-04 above 2001-02 levels because of a legislated change in the standard of  		proof. The state increased staff full-time equivalents (FTEs) for medicine by  		28%. Complaint closures in this biennium increased slightly more--by 31%, or 2%  		more cases per FTE. The average time to closure was also reduced by 7%  		(Virginia DHP 2004, appendix G). </p>
<h3>Innovations Ancillary to Complaint Resolution</h3>
<p><b><i>Promulgation of Rules in Lieu of Case-by-Case  		Enforcement</i></b></p>
<p>A non-disciplinary alternative to complaint resolution is to try to  		improve medical practices through education or guidelines. Washington State,  		for example, has listed as a formal goal moving From Reaction to  		Prevention through Education (2002, p. 8). Like any administrative  		agency, Medical Boards can not only make decisions through adjudicatory,  		case-by-case proceedings but also through legislative style rule making to  		govern frequently arising cases. The case study Boards tried to make rules both  		to protect public safety in advance and to reduce their own burden of resolving  		multiple similar complaints. </p>
<p>Ohio managers credited the states advance rules on  		over-prescribing as being very helpful in addressing a recurring category of  		cases involving physicians who abused drugs by writing prescriptions in the  		names of relatives. The Board cooperated with the pharmacy board not only to  		ban such physicians prescriptions but also to ban pharmacists from  		filling them--with the result that such cases disappeared from regulatory  		dockets. In another example, the Massachusetts Boards review of  		confidential, non-disciplinary hospital reports made an early discovery of  		emerging problems from bariatric surgery, a newly popular type of procedure.  		The Board issued an emergency rule to govern such practices, and managers  		believe they avoided problems as a result.</p>
<p>Other rule making followed more general trends; changes often reacted to  		national shifts in medical practice or new media attention to problems (Adams  		2001b). The rise of outpatient surgery provides one example. Virginia, like  		many other Boards nationally, assessed general information about anesthesia and  		sedation, including the statutes and regulations of other state boards, and  		convened an expert advisory panel before establishing minimum standards through  		regulation. Such a response is akin to scope of practice regulation for  		licensure, and can draw complaints of over regulating legitimate new practices  		desired by consumers. Rules on pain medications illustrate a similar dilemma,  		where protection against abuses needs to be weighed against strong demand for  		more effective pain relief than is conventionally supplied (Kaufman 2003).</p>
<p><b><i>A New Process for Some Quality  		Complaints</i></b></p>
<p>Ohio has created an alternative process that diverts some  		quality-related complaints from conventional disciplinary process into its  		QIP.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote66">66</a></font></sup> QIP uses less  		formal, non-adversarial administrative evaluation to quickly resolve  		quality-related cases that do not look serious but might prove to be (Ohio  		Board 2004). It was developed in the mid-1990s to cope with a growing backlog  		of cases that investigators were reluctant to close without any inquiry but  		were constantly postponing to cope with the constant flow of newer, clearly  		more serious cases. Many involved a practitioners poor practice patterns  		or failure to keep up with current practice standards that did not actively  		endanger patients but that might worsen without intervention. Such problems  		were believed to be remediable with a modest amount of retraining, often  		focused on a single practice deficit rather than across-the-board problems.</p>
<p>Cases are referred to QIP before formal charges are brought. Hence  		confidentiality protections apply as during conventional investigation, and  		full legal requirement of due process are not yet applied. QIP is run by two  		parallel panels, each with six physicians representing key specialties and one  		lay member. The physicians are not Board members, so they constitute a new  		source of expertise, and the time burden on members is kept down because the  		two panels alternate sessions, each meeting every other month.</p>
<p>The panels each review medical records and other submissions in the  		manner of peer review rather than adversarial hearing, which permits peer  		discussions with the licensee. QIP panels may close a case without action, send  		a caution letter to the physician, refer the physician to a remedial  		educational program, or return the case to conventional discipline if  		irreparable and serious problems seem likely. </p>
<p>QIP effectively eliminated the backlog of low-quality cases, according  		to managers. In 2003, the panels resolved 103 cases, simply closing almost 60%  		of cases, sending letters for 20%, and sending about 10% each to re-education  		or back to discipline. This throughput is of similar scope to conventional  		process, which in that year held 49 hearings and took 153 actions (Ohio Board  		2003). One board member especially liked that QIP has a foundation in medical  		theory because it is grounded in peer review. Another wanted to expand the  		number of panels available to incorporate more medical specialties.</p>
<p>QIPs confidentiality, use of the panels own medical  		expertise to reach judgments, and emphasis on remediation makes it resemble a  		prior eras informal Board practice. It marks a sharp departure from the  		formal adjudicative model universally used for todays discipline. One  		outside observer suggested that over use of QIP could present opportunity  		for abuse as well as to do good, as there is a real  		danger in returning to informal, secret disciplinary practices.</p>
<p><i><b>External, Educational Assessments of Physician  		Competence</b></i></p>
<p>Key informants in multiple states explained that it is always difficult  		to evaluate physician competence or to re-educate physicians with a quality  		deficit, especially through the fact-finding and formal orders of adversarial  		disciplinary process.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote67">67</a></font></sup> Yet many practitioners over time are  		believed to develop particularized deficits in competence such as those  		targeted by QIP. The mismatch between one-time testing of competency and  		lifetime medical practice has created interest in other methods, although these  		are not yet much used.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote68">68</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There was interest among case study respondents in referring physicians  		for assessment at private educational entities, often termed clinical  		assessment centers (Prager 2000). Such centers can undertake  		thoroughgoing, hands-on assessments using a variety of mechanisms,  		and also typically offer additional retraining as needed. Techniques include  		structured clinical interviews by expert physicians based on actual patient  		charts from the doctors own practice as well as hypothetical charts,  		simulated patient encounters, interpretation of diagnostic tests, objective  		answer written tests, computer-based assessment of cognitive skills, and review  		of documentation. A number of such programs exist across the country (Prager  		2000; Terry 2002b; CAC 2003; FSMB 2005a). Among the best known are the PACE  		program at the University of San Diego School of Medicine (Physician Assessment  		and Clinical Education), CPEP in Aurora, Colorado (private non-profit Center  		for Personalized Education for Physicians), and the Physician Assessment and  		Individualized CME program at the University of Wisconsin Medical  		School.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote69">69</a></font></sup> The  		Federation has begun working with multiple such programs; one goal is more  		standardization (FSMB 2005b).</p>
<p>Managers in all of the case study states were aware of such programs,  		yet most of the study states made few such referrals. The only large user of  		such services was California, which now often makes sanctioned physicians  		undergo remedial training at PACE (J. Fellmeth &amp; Papageorge 2005). CAC  		(2003) also found only one large user Board nationally. Board managers and  		staff often noted the high costs to physicians, about $5,000 in tuition plus  		costs of absence from practice, a factor also mentioned in the literature  		(Prager 2000). Of course, costs are also very high on both sides even for Board  		investigation of quality cases and can be especially high for prosecuted  		quality cases, as noted above. Physicians must typically pay for the programs  		themselves; one Board manager particularly emphasized that there no state  		resources could be made available for such costs.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote70">70</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Disseminating Physician Information: A  		Complementary Approach</b></i></p>
<p>One new approach is to give consumers information before they use  		medical services as well as to respond to any complaints they may have  		afterward. The world wide web gave Boards a cost-effective means to help  		patients become better consumers by providing more information about  		physicians, including information about their disciplinary and malpractice  		history. Massachusetts was the first state to create and maintain physician  		profiles, starting in 1996 (Sullivan 2000). </p>
<p>The Massachusetts approach served as a model that numerous other states  		have followed (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit20">Exhibit 20</a>). States postings  		typically include background data of general interest to consumers, such as a  		physicians insurance plan participation, hospital affiliation, and  		medical specialties. Also generally provided are past sanctions against each  		physician and often malpractice payments as well.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote71">71</a></font></sup> Malpractice information is controversial,  		as many physicians believe that many or most payouts are little related to past  		medical negligence, much less to ongoing competence. Pending complaints and  		past ones closed without public sanction are typically not included.</p>

</tr></table><p>The Massachusetts website has proven very popular. In 2003 it totaled  		over 16 million hits (Massachusetts Board 2003)--or about 600 per  		licensed physician. Web-posting can also make information about Board sanctions  		more readily available to interested consumers than does the traditional form  		of disclosure through periodic Board newsletters. Those mailings themselves may  		have more durable impact because they are also commonly posted online.  		Conceptually, greater visibility through online postings could increase the  		deterrence effect of Board activities, as health care plans, individual  		consumers, and the media have ready access to the sites. However, evidence is  		lacking.</p>
<p>Beneficial side effects of public disclosure on Board performance are  		also cited, resulting from disclosure and some new public feedback. As a result  		of profiling, the Massachusetts executive director has argued, Our data  		quality is better, our staff is sharper, and our closeness to the public and  		its concerns has never been more intimate (Sullivan 2000).</p>
<p><b><i>Quality-Diversion Models</i></b></p>
<p>One potentially effective idea discussed by some case study participants  		is for Boards to cooperate more with hospitals and other front-line facilities  		to find doctors with remediable quality problems early on, then intervene with  		education rather than punishment. Such practitioners could be diverted away  		from discipline into re-education, following the precedent set by physician  		assistance programs for impaired doctors.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote72">72</a></font></sup> Another precedent in the case study  		states is Ohios QIP process for certain quality complaints, which also  		takes a non-disciplinary approach to quality concerns. </p>
<p>Every case study state and almost every state nationwide has such a  		physician assistance program, a 1980s innovation designed as a more  		productive alternative to discipline for doctors with treatable substance abuse  		or mental or physical impairment. Funding comes partly from the Medical Boards  		(in Washington State with a dedicated share of physician licensure fees),  		partly from participants, who typically pay for their own treatment, meetings  		expense, and compliance costs. Quality diversion could readily use the same  		types of national clinical assessment centers noted above.</p>
<p>Under quality diversion, physicians could self-refer (possibly  		encouraged by colleagues or hospital officials) or Board staff could send some  		disciplinary cases for the type of assessment and re-education to which QIP and  		some other states already refer some physicians. The goal would be early  		intervention and prevention of harm, using the educational alternative not as  		an adjunct to completed discipline as in California today but instead in place  		of discipline altogether. </p>
<p>To be effective, such programs would need to motivate provider  		institutions to provide more referrals of physicians with quality problems than  		the institutions historically have referred to discipline. Todays  		impairment diversion programs are also small; California, for example, had only  		about 250 participants in its 5 year program as of mid-2004 (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Papageorge 2004). Eliciting more referrals would likely require persuading  		health care institutions that the Board program is a trustworthy partner in  		re-education. </p>
<p>Another challenge for effectiveness is ongoing monitoring. One  		shortcoming of relying on clinical assessment centers for quality oversight is  		rather weak follow-up through applied education in a practitioners home  		area. Some respondents noted that effective monitoring requires that local  		entities need to be involved as well a national center especially local medical  		schools or medical societies. The effectiveness of compliance monitoring for  		impairment diversion has also sometimes been questioned (J. Fellmeth &amp;  		Papageorge 2005; Thompson 2005a).</p>
<p>One small national effort to get institutions and Boards to cooperate on  		quality diversion began in 2002 to encourage Boards of medicine and nursing to  		take this re-educational approach for a much larger number of cases. This  		Practitioner Remediation and Enhancement Partnership (PREP) is run by a  		nongovernmental organization to promote patient safety by helping medical and  		nursing boards work with hospitals and other providers to identify,  		remediate, and monitor caregivers with deficiencies that are cause for  		concern yet do not rise to the level of precipitating  		disciplinary action (CAC 2002, p.1)--a standard similar to that of  		Ohios QIP. The program refers such people for assessment and re-education  		to facilities like Colorados CPEP (described above). PREPs  		operations were beyond the scope of this project.</p>
<p><i><b>Patient Care Assessment in  		Massachusetts</b></i></p>
<p>The Massachusetts Board runs a safety-oriented, hospital-focused system  		of physician oversight quite apart from discipline. The Board describes its  		authority as unique, deriving from legislation that gives it authority to  		require most health care facilities to run systems of quality assurance, risk  		management, peer review, and credentialing known as PCA programs. The enactment  		dates from 1986, responding to a prior liability insurance crisis. The  		rationale for involving the physician Board was that physician leadership is  		needed for quality assurance to succeed and that physicians should have to  		practice only in safe institutional environments.</p>
<p>The Board reviews and approves facilities PCA plans and monitoring  		their operations through three types of required reports. Two types of  		mandatory reports on progress implementing plans are submitted semi-annually  		and annually. A third requirement is reporting of major incidents,  		that is, serious, unexpected patient outcomes, somewhat similar to  		the sentinel events that JCAHO requires to be investigated within  		hospitals. PCA reports to the Board are due within about three months (to allow  		time for investigation and action); they are entirely confidential and  		undiscoverable in legal actions. Each contains narrative about the case,  		explaining what happened, how the hospital investigated, and what changes were  		later made to prevent recurrence.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote73">73</a></font></sup> Other matters may also be sent to the PCA  		committee from within the medical Board if they seem to involve matters of  		facility safety.</p>
<p>The Board PCA committee operates separately from licensure and  		discipline, not sharing any identified information with them. The committee  		reviews the submissions to see how well hospitals in-house programs are  		working. In particular, they assess whether changes made in response to  		problems were appropriate and sufficient. Board members and managers believe  		that the PCA program has positive impacts on helping create a general climate  		supportive of safety. They cite the discovery of problems in bariatric surgery  		and ensuing standards (above) as a key success that prevented problems rather  		than disciplining them after the fact.</p>
<p>As of 2004-05, the states policy on sanctioning and safety  		appeared to be in evolution, as officials and stakeholders were sorting out  		what entities would have what responsibilities. It was as yet unclear what  		roles were to be played by physicians, by hospitals, and by hospital and  		physician regulators. Also being debated were what one key informant called the  		tensions between the blaming culture of discipline and  		the reporting culture of patient safety that calls for a  		non-disciplinary blame free approach to medical error that promotes  		disclosure and learning from problems (see also Bovbjerg et al. 2001). Some in  		the state had begun promoting a new approach to accountability that charges  		institutions with avoiding most problems including ordinary errors but holds  		individuals accountable for knowing misconduct or disregard of safety  		strictures. The state health department, within whose umbrella the Medical  		Board operates, also created a new Patient Safety center in 2004, with an  		agenda that overlaps with the Boards PCA program.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote74">74</a></font></sup> A public-private coalition is also  		considering the allocation of safety and monitoring authority.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote75">75</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Other Innovations</h3>
<p>Many Board members and managers expressed a desire to do more for safety  		than react to complaints. The literature review and case study respondents  		suggested some other pro-active alternatives to complaint-based discipline.  		These included audits of physician practices, non-disciplinary use of CACs, and  		efforts to encourage ongoing maintenance of competence.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote76">76</a></font></sup> Such approaches not now observable in the  		field were beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">CONCLUDING DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>State Medical Boards play an important role in American health care  		quality assurance because these licensing agencies are the only entities with  		the authority to completely stop practitioners from practicing beyond their  		level of competence (Jost 2002). Other entities also affect clinical  		performance, often on a more day-to-day basis: For example, hospitals employ  		some practitioners, grant staff privileges to non-employees, conduct internal  		peer reviews, and may run patient safety systems. Medical groups influence  		their physicians activities. Private medical specialty boards credential  		specialists. Health plans admit practitioners to their provider networks and  		may review the appropriateness and quality of care. Other practitioners refer  		patients to particular practitioners or do not. Patients also play a role in  		selecting they practitioners they see, the facilities they use, and the  		therapies they receive. However, only State Medical Boards have ultimate legal  		authority over all ways and areas in which physicians practice--inside or  		outside of hospitals, cooperating or not with safety or quality protocols, and  		keeping up with evolving standards of practice or not.</p>
<p>By statute and stated mission, State Medical Boards activities and  		their budgets are driven by the need to resolve public complaints. Thus,  		complaint resolution is the core of traditional Board quality assurance beyond  		initial licensure. What matters to success (or failure) in this key function is  		finding and appropriately sanctioning substandard physicians. This in turn  		requires sufficient intake of complaints, well targeted processing of  		complaints, and effective Board review of allegations--all accomplished within  		an adversary legal process. Success results when a Board can move cases quickly  		and efficiently through multiple stages, from complaint intake to discipline  		and follow-up (<a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a>); failure is visible in  		large backlogs of cases and inability to prioritize so as to address those with  		the most serious implications for safe patient care. </p>
<p>This project found that cases readily back up in investigation, in peer  		review, and in administrative proceedings. It identified a number of key  		features and strategies that Boards employ, to varying degrees, to fulfill  		their required functions, including:</p>
<ul><li>using initial triage to drop cases of low importance; </li>
<li>monitoring of throughput of cases in investigation; </li>
<li>enhancing peer review capacity for quality cases, including  		  contracting out for reviews; </li>
<li>coordinating and collaborating between hearing attorneys and  		  investigators, especially on serious cases;</li>
<li>applying sanctions for substandard physician practice more promptly  		  and consistently across cases; and</li>
<li>improved managerial capacity to track cases, along with  		  self-monitoring of performance to continuously develop and perpetuate  		  improvements. </li>
</ul><p>Almost all Board members and managers believed that better IT is needed  		to improve efficiency, target resources, develop better tools for spotting and  		managing problem cases, and meet higher standards of accountability. A key  		issue was perceived to be focusing resources on high-value cases, ones most  		likely to call for disciplinary action in the end. Improving performance with  		IT calls not just for acquiring computer capabilities but also for using them  		effectively. A number of other requisites to maximizing a Boards  		functional performance were noted by case study participants: (i) inputting all  		relevant information--not only on licensure and disciplinary status but also on  		associated staffing, hours, expenses, and other managerial information; (ii)  		having analytical capability to use the information once it is made available;  		and (iii) accessing or developing standards by which to measure performance.  		Moving to more automated and analytical approaches calls for different staffing  		than traditional clerical input for paper files; experience in automating  		licensure suggests than some staffing shifts can be achieved. Larger Boards  		appear to be at an advantage in creating fulltime new specialists.<sup><font><a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#endnote77">77</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As for standards of comparison, analysts within Boards and external  		reviewers like the California Enforcement Monitor mainly relied upon  		comparisons with prior times and common sense assessment. Umbrella Boards also  		often compared statistics across different health professions. Enhancing  		Boards abilities to make comparisons across states and with regulatory  		activities in other areas would likely be helpful. The Federation offers Boards  		that complete its member survey comparisons with similar states responses  		(without identifying states), but there is interest in doing more. The  		development of benchmarks on costs per activity, timeliness, and other measures  		may be helpful based on the experience of State Medical Boards that have access  		to such information. </p>
<p>All senior managers believed they could accomplish more with better  		tools and staff, and there was suggestive evidence of such improvements in the  		experience of two Boards that received marked budget increases during the case  		study period observed. A generation ago, leaders of the Federation of State  		Medical Boards wrote in a leading medical journal, The success of boards  		to improve medical discipline will finally depend, of course, on the funding,  		staffing, and authority of state boards. These can only come from state  		legislatures willing to "act responsibly (Breaden &amp; Galusha 1987). To  		this assessment today must be added the observation that in order to command  		additional resources in an era of constraint Boards must better document their  		performance needs and their achievements. Board budgets in the past have been  		boosted mainly in response to failure--a highly publicized case detailing  		backlogged complaints or a clearly errant physician whom the Board had  		neglected to discipline. Hopeful signs are visible from California,  		Massachusetts, and Virginia that better analysis documenting performance  		achievements and needs can also encourage better budgetary and other forms of  		support from the rest of state government.</p>
<p>Traditional forms of complaint-driven discipline and mechanisms for  		improvement were necessarily the focus of this case study, for that is what  		Boards mainly do to protect medical quality and safety beyond initial  		licensure. Complaint investigation and resolution respond to acute problems,  		risks that have already affected patients, at least as perceived by patients  		themselves. Board members and managers participating in this case study were  		acutely aware of the shortcomings of their traditional approach--its reactive  		nature and inherently high costs and low speed. High costs come both from  		having to find a small number of substandard needles in a large haystack of  		somewhat haphazard consumer complaints and from the need to conclusively prove  		unacceptable quality through expert testimony within an adversarial process of  		administrative law that protects physicians rights and the legal  		integrity of fact finding.</p>
<p>These managers and members of State Medical Boards were also very  		interested in finding more proactive and preventive ways to meet their  		statutory role of protecting the public. Case study participants described some  		alternative mechanisms already in use in some places, including:</p>
<ul><li>establishing advance rules where possible to improve practice without  		  waiting for complaints;</li>
<li>a special review process by Board subpanels to resolve a subset of  		  quality-related complaints;</li>
<li>use of national clinical assessment centers as an adjunct to  		  discipline;</li>
<li>patient education through physician profiles posted online;</li>
<li>board review of hospital incidents and responsive safety mechanisms,  		  wholly separate from discipline; and</li>
<li>cooperation with hospitals for early detection of physician with  		  deficits in capabilities, for remediation in place of discipline.</li>
</ul><p>Many Board members and managers also expressed a desire to do more for  		safety than react to complaints. The literature review and case study  		respondents suggested some other proactive alternatives to complaint-based  		discipline. These included audits of physician practices, non-disciplinary use  		of CACs, and efforts to encourage ongoing maintenance of competence. Such  		approaches not now observable in the field were beyond the scope of this  		study.</p>
<p><b>Implications</b>. This case study documented many aspects of State  		Medical Boards structure and operations. It also identified practices  		considered to make discipline more efficient or effective. The extent of  		variation observed across Boards in terms of such factors as rates of  		sanctions, timeliness of case closure, investigatory staffing ratios, budgetary  		support, and many other outputs and inputs suggests that Boards may have much  		to learn from one another. Such learning seemed possible based on interest of  		managers and others from these six states. A cross-cutting lesson from all is  		that some organized assessments of Board performance using data on problems and  		accomplishments were followed by the grant of more resources and other  		Board-desired changes from state legislatures in at least Virginia,  		Massachusetts, and California. Managers from case study states consistently  		pushed for more IT and data capabilities as IT was described as facilitating  		such analyses.</p>
<p><b>Limitations</b>. This study focused mainly on experience in six case  		study states, although it also drew upon comparative national data to describe  		many elements of Board structure, operations, and performance. The six states  		are not representative but rather were judgmentally selected to be likely to  		show innovations in approach. The comparative data available lacked fully  		standardized definitions, which makes cross-state comparisons imperfect, for  		example on the number and nature of complaints. Another measure tabulated,  		elapsed time to case resolution, is incomplete in that a state can have quick  		resolution of cases actually closed but a growing backlog of very old cases;  		conversely, a state improving by closing out its backlog thereby raised the  		average time to closure. Finally, the literature, Board managers and members,  		and other observers agreed that it is impossible to measure any direct impact  		of Board activities on public health or safety, although most Board personnel  		felt that their activities had beneficial impacts.</p>
<p><b>Next steps</b>. One major near term development for Boards will  		likely be acquiring and using new IT and data management capabilities to  		improve effectiveness and efficiency of disciplinary performance. Such  		improvement was being actively sought in every case study state. It was  		suggested that working toward performance improvement calls for not only new IT  		hardware and software but also: (i) a new approach to tabulating all relevant  		information in one database--on licensure and disciplinary status and also on  		associated staffing, hours, expenses, and other managerial information; (ii)  		having analytical capability to use the information once it is made available;  		and (iii) accessing or developing standards by which to measure performance.  		Data from the Federations member board survey is already made available  		to states for certain comparisons with de-identified other states, which has  		the strengths and limitations already noted. Demand for comparative  		capabilities and benchmarks may well grow. Performance standards for physicians  		or more objective definitions of competence are also of great interest to many  		Board managers.</p>
<p>For policy research, the next steps may be to more rigorously study  		existing state interventions or conduct demonstrations to see how well some of  		them travel to new states. More careful study would be useful for  		such things as Californias use of clinical assessment centers,  		Massachusettss physician profiling and unusual relationship with hospital  		safety efforts (the PCA), Ohios quality improvement program, and efforts  		in numerous states to form teams of investigators, managers, and lawyers to  		streamline the handling of important cases. Non-case study states of course  		also offer opportunities for study.</p>

<p><a name="endnote21" id="endnote21">For</a> this reason, another well known typology  			 expands to five types of board in order to categorize states by each  			 Boards control over licensure fees as well as by its extent of  			 administrative autonomy (Shimberg, 1982, 1991; Schmitt and Shimberg 1996). As  			 of 1996, most states 21 of 50 had boards with shared authority,  			 meaning that a central agency oversees budget, staff, and may also investigate  			 complaints and hold hearings, but boards make final decisions on disciplining  			 doctors. Next most common (17/50) were autonomous boards that hire  			 staff, investigate complaints, discipline licenses, collect fees and maintain  			 their own budget. Small numbers of states had boards that shared  			 administrative functions with a central agency, had limited  			 authority, or where the state operated a centralized licensing  			 authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote22" id="endnote22">One</a> states interviewees described in  			 detail how cutbacks were imposed during administrative preparation of budgets  			 even before any request was made to the legislature.

<p><a name="endnote24" id="endnote24">We</a> adjust by practicing physicians rather  			 than licensed ones, as we expect non-practicing physicians to generate little  			 regulatory work and therefore to impose very modest budgetary burdens.</p>

<li>
<p><a name="endnote25" id="endnote25">The</a> national data are presented by  			 percentile because a few extreme values appear implausible and may be artifacts  			 of reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote26" id="endnote26">In</a> Virginia, for example, the medical board  			 spends only about 40% of the Board total, with the balance allocated to the  			 umbrella Department of Health Professions performs many Board functions,  			 including disciplinary and preparation of cases for hearing, as well as  			 automated systems and staff for budgetary, financial, and human resources  			 management (Virginia DHP 2004).</p>

<p><a name="endnote27" id="endnote27">The</a> question: Is the amount of public  			 attention paid to discipline related to medical quality presently less, the  			 same or more than it was a few years ago:</p>

<li>
<p><a name="endnote30" id="endnote30">Massachusetts</a> has a separate section, its  			 Data Repository Unit, which indicates the state received 6280 such reports in  			 2003, of which 236 reports were forwarded to the Enforcement Division for  			 further investigation, and 196 statutory reports relating to potential  			 impairment issues were forwarded to the Physician Health and Compliance Unit  			 Annual Report 2003.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote32" id="endnote32">One</a> category of complaint almost never  			 mentioned by managers was unlicensed practice of medicine. In contrast, early  			 commentators often complained that medical boards were more eager to prosecute  			 unlicensed practice by physicians competitors than to discipline errant  			 physicians (e.g., Gross 1984). Only Washington State tabulated such complaints.  			 One reason may be that Boards refer such cases to other authorities.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote34" id="endnote34">Case</a> study reporting is quite incomplete,  			 however, as only half of the six states are represented in this data field.  			 Moreover, some states reported such low staffing (owing partly to drawing staff  			 from other parts of state government), that the extremes of the distribution  			 are very skewed. The very low staffing reported by a few makes the complaint  			 per staff huge and the mean implausible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote35" id="endnote35">Jost</a> et al. (1993) reviewed a random sample  			 of Ohio cases from 1990 and reported that very few non-jurisdictional closures  			 consisted of below threshold complaints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote36" id="endnote36">The</a> extent of pre-investigatory closure  			 varies by state. California is unusual in doing much more in-office triage than  			 the other states observed. It closes some 90% or more of consumer-initiated  			 complaints without a field investigation (Fellmeth and Pagageorge 2004). This  			 figure is not directly comparable to other states because California sends  			 quality-related cases to medical screening without field investigation, whereas  			 other states handled such reviews through investigation. Note:  			 <a href="state-discipline-physicians-assessing-state-medical-boards-thruogh-case-studies.html#exhibit15">Exhibit 15</a> shows closed complaints, so each successive  			 stage come from an earlier time period. Not truly a flow of cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote37" id="endnote37">In</a> Iowa, any summary suspensions occur at  			 the end of the investigation (Iowa BME 2005).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote38" id="endnote38">A</a> 1993 outside audit and a 2001-02 sunset  			 review of the California Boards closures found insufficient investigation  			 or follow up for hundreds of cases. See Fellmeth and Papageorge 2004, pp. 33  			 and 83. In Virginia, an audit committee review found that quality of care cases  			 were few and closed with insufficient investigation. JLARC 2000, pp 71-72. Such  			 an investigation of the completeness of documentation was beyond the scope of  			 this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="endnote39" id="endnote39">States</a> make varying use of letters or  			 notices of education, warning, correction, or deficiency--the nomenclature also  			 varies by state--but the exact extent of use if often not reported. Washington  			 State (2004a) reports that such actions are rare, resolving only three  			 complaints against physicians and physicians assistants during the 2001-03  			 biennium, out of 2,031 received. It is unclear to what extent these occur  			 during investigation or only at the immediate pre-charging stage.</p>

<p><a name="endnote45" id="endnote45">According</a> to the Bank, state Boards also  			 somewhat underreport actions.

<p><a name="endnote46" id="endnote46">According</a> to USGAO (1989, p.4) VA  			 [Veterans Affairs] is reluctant to send to the federation the names of  			 physicians who resign or retire before receiving a hearing because an  			 opportunity for such a hearing is a due process right.

<p><a name="endnote60" id="endnote60">Nationally,</a> at least 40 state Boards lack a  			 physician on staff. The Federations Exchange shows that 11 jurisdictions  			 reported having a full time physician on staff or assigned to them. Some of  			 these reports are probably miscoded for physicians with standing agreements to  			 serve on request, rather than working full-time. The highest state reported  			 having 65 full-time physicians, but its web page lists only 20 staff, none with  			 a medical degree, and no position of medical director. This state was not among  			 the six in this case study.

<p><a name="endnote68" id="endnote68">One</a> little used approach was a type of  			 written continuing-competency exams called the Special Purpose Examination.  			 SPEX is a multiple-choice test developed by the Federation and the National  			 Board of Medical Examiners in the 1980s (FSMB 2005b) and completed on an  			 automated basis. FLEX and similar exams were seldom mentioned by case study  			 interviewees; FLEX itself seemed to be used mainly for physicians applying to  			 move from another state, and a recent national survey of Boards confirmed that  			 few states used this or similar tests more than a few times a year (CAC  			 2003).</p>

<li>
<p><a name="endnote70" id="endnote70">Another</a> factor may be the perceived strength  			 of legal authority to order a range of examinations for doctors as part of  			 investigation rather than in conjunction with imposing a sanction by settlement  			 or decision after hearing (including QIP proceedings, above). This legal issue  			 was not addressed with interviewees. The Federations Exchange (2003b),  			 Table 32 suggests that almost all Boards may require examinations;  			 OH Revd Stat. sect. 4731.22 that authorizes the QIP says that it may  			 offeran educational and assessment program.</p>

<p>f. I) How many resulted in a prejudicial disciplinary action before or  		after a formal hearing? <i>Prejudicial Action is defined as: 1.) Modification  		of a physicians license, or the privileges granted by that license, 2.)  		that results in a penalty or reprimand, etc., to the physician. Such action is  		specific to the individual physician as opposed to a group of physicians  		(example: denial of a license due to adverse information concerning an  		individual as opposed to a denial based on lack of qualification that would  		apply to a large group of people). </i></p>
<p><i>Prejudicial Actions taken against a license that include: revocation,  		suspension, surrender or mandatory retirement of license, loss of privileges  		afforded by that license, probation, limitation or restriction of license or of  		licensed privileges, letters of reprimand or warning, and or fines </i></p>
<p><i>II) How many resulted in a non-prejudicial disciplinary action before  		or after a formal hearing? Non-Prejudicial Action is defined as: actions not  		included in the above prejudicial actions. These actions are frequently  		administrative in nature, such as a license denial due to lack of  		qualification, a reinstatement following disciplinary action, probation  		termination, license issued following a previous denial or vacating a prior  		order of the board. </i></p>
