<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">SECTION 1: SUMMARY OF RESULTS</a></h2>
<p>A variety of demographic factors and policy initiatives have led to  		increased demand for residential facilities that offer supportive services for  		the aged and disabled. Over the past 20 years, board and care homes have  		emerged as the most common setting for the provision of such care outside  		nursing homes. As a result, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  		and Evaluation (ASPE) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  		(DHHS) has had a long-standing interest in the potential of board and care  		homes to meet the needs of aged and disabled persons for residential  		services.</p>
<p>In line with this interest, ASPE was concerned with reports that raised  		questions about the effectiveness of State regulation of these homes and about  		the adequacy of care provided. Thus, in the early 1990s, ASPE initiated a new  		examination of board and care homes and their role in the long-term care  		system. The policy interest was threefold:</p>
<ul><li>To document the characteristics of board and care homes, how much  		  they had grown in the United States since the initial studies of the 1980s, and  		  the role they play in meeting the needs of the disabled for long-term care</li>
<li>To describe the characteristics of board and care residents,  		  particularly the extent of frailty and disability among residents </li>
<li>To assess the quality of care received by board and care residents  		  and examine the effect of State regulation on the quality of that care.</li>
</ul><p>The study results reported here deal with the effects of regulation on  		the quality of care in board and care, or domiciliary care, facilities. The  		database for the study included data gathered in 512 board and care facilities  		in 10 States. These data were collected through interviews in 386 licensed  		homes and 126 unlicensed homes with 512 facility operators, 1,138 facility  		staff, and 3,257 facility residents.</p>
<p>This report presents the analysis of the effect of regulation and  		licensure on the quality of care in board and care homes. It also briefly  		reviews the study purpose and methodology, as well as a description of the  		homes and residents; however, these topics are addressed in greater detail in  		two other project reports: <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/bcdesces.htm"><i>A Description of Board and  		Care Facilities, Operators, and Residents</i></a> (Wildfire et al., 1995) and  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/stumthes.htm"><i>Report on Study Methods</i></a> (Hawes et al.,  		1995).</p>
<p>The remainder of the report explores the findings about the effect of  		regulation and licensure in great detail; <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a>  		summarizes those findings. As the data summarized in that exhibit demonstrate,  		this inquiry found substantial and widespread positive effects of regulation on  		quality in board and care homes.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Reducing Prevalence of Unlicensed Homes</b></p>
<p>First, we found that States with extensive regulatory systems had a  			 significantly smaller proportion of unlicensed facilities. Regulation seems to  			 reduce the prevalence of unlicensed homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improving Quality of Care</b></p>
<p>Second, we found that extensive regulatory systems were associated  			 with better quality of care. Several findings suggest that homes in States with  			 extensive regulatory systems were better prepared to cope with needs of  			 residents who are frail and disabled. For example, homes operating under more  			 extensive regulatory systems were more likely to have operators trained in care  			 of the elderly and disabled, to have lower use of psychotropic drugs, and to  			 have lower use of inappropriate prescriptions for the elderly. Also, staff in  			 licensed homes in States with extensive regulatory systems were more  			 knowledgeable about and more willing to refer residents and families to the  			 long-term care ombudsmen programs. In addition, licensed homes made a wider  			 array of key supportive services available to residents. Finally, both  			 extensive regulation in large homes and licensure in all sizes of homes were  			 associated with greater availability of devices, such as grab-bars in showers,  			 call buttons in bathrooms, and raised toilet seats, that support residents'  			 abilities to function more independently and with greater safety. Thus, both  			 licensure and extensive regulation were associated with key aspects of better  			 quality of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improving Quality of Life</b></p>
<p>Third, the study found a consistent pattern with respect to many of  			 the features that promote quality of life for residents. Homes in States with  			 extensive regulatory systems, for example, had greater availability of social  			 aids for residents, such as reading materials, a community room, and a working  			 television and radio. Also, contrary to the expectations of some observers who  			 fear that regulation will lead to more "institutional" environments, the study  			 found that neither extensive regulation nor licensure was associated with more  			 institutional environments when one considers such factors as personalization  			 of residents' rooms; diversity in furniture, wall colors, and floor coverings;  			 and lighting in the homes. In fact, extensive regulation and licensure made a  			 facility less likely to have a "low" score on such diversity. Taken together  			 with the positive impact on social and recreational aids, such findings suggest  			 that regulation has a positive effect on key aspects of quality of life in  			 facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Improving Safety</b></p>
<p>Fourth, like other studies, we found that regulation had a positive  			 effect on the safety of the residents' environment. Licensed facilities had a  			 wider array of the safety features considered important by residents and others  			 who study the ability of a facility to meet the needs of frail and disabled  			 individuals (Moos and Lemke, 1988). Compared to unlicensed facilities,  			 including apartments, licensed facilities had a higher percentage of safety  			 features, such as smoke detectors, a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, secure  			 handrails on stairs, and supportive devices, such as grab-bars in the shower,  			 call buttons in the bathroom, and grab-bars by the toilet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Preventing the "Worst" Performance</b></p>
<p>Fifth, the study found that regulation, mainly through licensure  			 alone, succeeds in what many view as the main role of regulation: preventing  			 homes from being in the lowest range of performance on key aspects of quality.  			 Licensed homes were less likely than were unlicensed homes to have the lowest  			 scores on safety, physical amenities, and social aids. They were also less  			 likely to have low diversity or a very institutional environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>No Positive Effect</b></p>
<p>Finally, the study also found that neither extensive regulation nor  			 licensure had a positive effect on some aspects of quality, including a  			 requirement for preservice training of staff and staff knowledge of care and  			 monitoring as well as medication management. Regulation also had no significant  			 effect on the cleanliness of homes and availability of amenities or the  			 likelihood that a home would have any licensed nurses (RNs or LPNs) on staff.  			 Further, there was little variation among homes on such issues as unmet health  			 care needs, residents' rights, and indicators of resident  			 satisfaction.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">SECTION 2: STUDY BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>Other than nursing homes, the most common form of residential setting  		with services for people with disabilities is board and care homes. This term  		is used in a variety of ways across the States. For our purposes, however,  		"board and care" refers to nonmedical community-based residential settings that  		house two or more unrelated adults and provide some services such as meals,  		medication supervision or reminders, organized activities, transportation, or  		help with bathing, dressing, or other activities of daily living (ADLs).</p>
<p>Over the past 2 decades, the board and care industry has experienced  		considerable growth. There are now approximately 34,000 licensed board and care  		homes in the United States with more than 613,000 beds (Clark et al., 1994).  		Licensed homes fall into one of three basic types of facilities (Clark et al.,  		1994): (1) licensed homes serving a clientele with mental retardation or  		developmental disabilities; (2) licensed homes serving a clientele with mental  		illness; and (3) licensed homes serving a mixed population of physically frail  		elderly, cognitively impaired elderly, and persons with mental health  		problems.</p>
<p>In addition, an unknown number of unlicensed facilities provide board  		and care. By some estimates (U.S. House, 1989), unlicensed homes are as  		numerous as licensed facilities. Thus, the total number of persons living and  		receiving long-term care in all types of board and care homes may be as high as  		1 million (Clark et al., 1994; Hawes et al., 1993; Moon et al., 1989; U.S.  		House, 1989). As a point of comparison, there are an estimated 17,000 licensed  		nursing homes with approximately 1.68 million beds serving more than 1.5  		million nursing home residents (DuNah et al., 1993).</p>
<p>While the importance of board and care homes as a source of long-term  		care has grown, so have questions about the quality of care provided by these  		facilities. Concerns were raised by the U.S. General Accounting Office,  		congressional hearings, and studies indicating that some residents were not  		receiving adequate care and protection from health and safety risks (Avorn et  		al., 1989; Budden, 1985; GAO, 1989, 1992a, 1992b; Hartzema et al., 1986; U.S.  		House, 1989). These studies reported evidence of unsafe and unsanitary  		conditions, widespread use of psychotropic medications, lack of staff knowledge  		about medication administration, and other health and safety problems. In  		addition, several reports raised questions about the effectiveness of State  		regulatory efforts (ABA, 1983; Dobkin, 1989; GAO, 1989; Hawes et al., 1993;  		Newcomer and Grant, 1988; Reichstein and Bergofsky, 1980; Stone and Newcomer,  		1985; U.S. DHHS Inspector General, 1990). There were also assertions that  		significant numbers of board and care homes were unlicensed and unregulated  		(U.S. House, 1989).</p>
<p>As a result of its interest in the potential of board and care homes to  		meet the needs of aged and disabled persons, the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and  		Human Services commissioned a study in the early 1980s by Denver Research  		Institute (DRI). The DRI study described board and care homes and residents in  		five States and investigated the effect of regulation on quality of care  		(Dittmar and Smith, 1983). In the early 1990s, ASPE initiated a new examination  		of board and care homes and their role in the long-term care system.</p>
<p>This report, <i>Analysis of the Effect of Regulation on the Quality of  		Care in Board and Care Homes</i>, describes one part of that ASPE initiative.  		This report, one of a series of four that summarize study findings and methods,  		presents analyses that examine the effect of licensure status and other aspects  		of regulation on structural, process, and resident-level aspects of quality in  		board and care homes.</p>
<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">SECTION 3: STUDY METHODS</a></h2>
<p>This section of the report provides a brief overview of the study  		methods. It discusses the study sampling approach, the measurement strategies,  		and the analytic strategy. Greater detail concerning the database, study  		methods, and measurement activities is provided in the technical report,  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/stumthes.htm"><i>Report on Study Methods</i></a> (Hawes et al., 1995).  		This report also provides greater detail on the testing of the interrater  		reliability of the instruments used for assessing the environmental features of  		the homes and on the construction of the quality measures. We describe the  		creation of the descriptive measures and the descriptive results in  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/bcdesces.htm"><i>A Description of Board and Care Facilities,  		Operators, and Residents</i></a> (Wildfire et al., 1995).</p>
<h3><a name="sec3.1" id="sec3.1">3.1 Sampling</a></h3>
<p>The first sampling task was the selection of 10 States that varied in  		their regulatory approaches. Within the chosen States, a stratified,  		three-stage, cluster design was implemented. First-stage sampling units were  		counties, second-stage units were facilities, and third-stage sampling units  		were residents and staff in homes. A probability sample of homes was selected  		from the list of homes that met the criteria for inclusion, stratified by  		whether they operated under an extensive or limited regulatory system, by  		licensure status (licensed/unlicensed), and by size (small, medium, and large).  		From this sample, random samples of residents and staff were selected.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Selecting States</h4>
<p>This study was designed to determine whether regulation affects the  		quality of care in licensed and unlicensed board and care homes. In selecting  		our 10 study States, we used a "polarized" approach, choosing for study those  		States with the widest differences in their regulatory systems. Using  		information from studies by the U.S. DHHS Inspector General (1990) and RTI's  		50-State survey for AARP (Hawes et al., 1993), we ranked States by their  		regulatory environments. In assessing the States' systems, we considered three  		dimensions of State regulatory environments:</p>
<ul><li> Licensure standards </li>
<li> Nature of the inspection process </li>
<li> Availability and use of compliance or enforcement mechanisms. </li>
</ul><p>We produced a comparative ranking of the regulatory environments among  		the 50 States. The States in the "extensively" regulated range had <b>more</b>  		stringent regulations and monitoring processes and a wider array of enforcement  		mechanisms than those on the "limited" end of the continuum. Five States were  		chosen from among those with the most extensive regulations. These were:  		California, Florida, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Oregon. From the States with  		more limited regulatory systems, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, and  		Texas were selected.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is a comparative ranking of the 50  		States. The States on the upper end of this continuum have a more extensive  		regulatory environment than States ranked below them on the continuum. However,  		we did not compare regulations in any of the States to some "gold standard" of  		regulation. Because our sample population was selected from the facilities in  		10 States that were purposively selected, the results reflect the board and  		care environment in those 10 States.</p>
<h4>3.1.2 Selecting Counties</h4>
<p>Across the 10 States, we selected 80 first-stage sampling units. These  		80 units were evenly divided between States with limited regulation and States  		with extensive regulation. A total of 128 counties were included in these 80  		first-stage sampling units.</p>
<h4>3.1.3 Selecting Board and Care Homes</h4>
<p>Within the 128 counties, 386 licensed facilities and 126 unlicensed  		facilities participated in the data collection. This represented 75 percent of  		the selected licensed facilities and 72 percent of the selected unlicensed  		facilities. The overall facility participation rate among those selected was  		74.2 percent.</p>
<h5>3.1.3.1 Selecting Licensed Board and Care Homes</h5>
<p>Each study State had different definitions or criteria for licensure of  		board and care homes. Even within States, there were multiple categories of  		homes and multiple agencies that licensed homes. Because of this variation, we  		adopted State-specific decision rules about inclusion and exclusion for both  		licensed and unlicensed homes. We included in the sample all facilities  		licensed as board and care homes that served an elderly or mixed  		elderly/disabled population. Facilities specifically licensed to serve only  		special populations (e.g., children, substance abusers) were excluded from the  		study. Thus, facilities licensed by departments of mental health or  		developmental disabilities to serve clients with mental health problems were  		also excluded because of their differing licensing standards and funding  		streams.</p>
<h5>3.1.3.2 Selecting Unlicensed Board and Care Homes</h5>
<p>We developed an operational definition for an eligible unlicensed board  		and care home based on State licensure requirements. We also defined specific  		criteria for inclusion of "assisted living" facilities and other places that  		included apartments, did not provide three meals a day or 24-hour staffing, but  		did provide key services (e.g., medication reminders or supervision, money  		management, and assistance with personal care).</p>
<h4>3.1.4 Selecting Residents and Staff</h4>
<p>Residents and staff were selected so that roughly equivalent numbers  		would be randomly sampled in small, medium, and large facilities. Interviews  		were completed with 3,258 residents or their proxies. Proxy respondents were  		used for residents who were either too cognitively impaired or too physically  		ill to respond to the interviewer. Facility staff who provided direct care to  		residents were the proxies for residents. The resident sample included 2,340  		residents in licensed facilities and 914 residents in unlicensed facilities.  		The overall participation rate for residents was 75 percent. The staff sample  		included 908 staff in licensed facilities and 230 staff in unlicensed  		facilities. The overall staff participation rate was 74 percent.</p>
<h3><a name="sec3.2" id="sec3.2">3.2 Data Collection</a></h3>
<p>During the summer and early fall of 1993, RTI Field Interviewers (FIs)  		conducted in-person interviews with operators, staff, and residents in the  		sampled facilities in the 10 study States. In addition, interviewers followed a  		protocol to conduct a structured observational "walk-through" of the home,  		rating various qualities of the facility. We conducted site visits in each of  		the licensed and unlicensed board and care homes. In all visits, we conducted  		interviews with operators, staff, and residents, and we observed the physical  		environment and care of residents.</p>
<h3><a name="sec3.3" id="sec3.3">3.3 Measurement</a></h3>
<p>We developed two basic types of measures: (1) those used to evaluate the  		quality of care and life in the homes, and (2) indicators describing the  		residents and facilities that were used as covariates in the analysis of the  		effect of regulation and licensure on quality. (See Hawes et al., 1995, and  		Wildfire et al., 1995, for more detail on project study methods and descriptive  		measures and results, respectively.)</p>
<h4>3.3.1 Quality Measures</h4>
<p>Donabedian (1966, 1980) and others have articulated the utility of  		different types of measures of quality, including the use of structure,  		process, and outcome measures to define quality. Outcomes are considered by  		some to be the <i>sine qua non</i> of measures, which may be true in acute and  		ambulatory care. However, in long-term care, measures of structure and process  		quality are especially relevant because residents not only receive care and  		services but also live in the care environment, often for years (Kane and Kane,  		1988; Lohr, 1988).</p>
<p>Moreover, research indicates that the physical and architectural  		features of group living settings can influence the behavior and well-being of  		residents and that residents have clear preferences for certain types of  		physical features in the residential environment (Brennan et al., 1988; Lawton,  		1977; Moore et al., 1986; Moos and Lemke, 1985; Moos et al., 1987; Nasar and  		Farokhpay, 1985; Newman, 1989; Reigner and Pynoss, 1987). Because of this we  		have included several measures designed to capture the characteristics of the  		environment. These represent important features from the perspective not only  		of experts in environmental design but, more important, from the perspective of  		residents living in such places as congregate apartments and personal care  		homes (Moos and Lemke, 1988; Newman, 1989).</p>
<p>Thus, we adopted a strategy that described quality in board and care  		homes using a variety of structural, process, and resident-level measures. The  		structural components of quality included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Safety of the physical environment</b> was shown by Moos and  			 Lemke (1988) to be the most important to residents among a set of seven  			 attributes of residential environments; this measure included lighting, the  			 presence of smoke detectors, and the use of nonskid surfaces on steps and in  			 bathrooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Adequacy of the physical environment</b> was characterized by  			 three constructs: availability of supportive devices (such as lift bars next to  			 toilet, handrails in bathroom), availability of social/recreational aids (e.g.,  			 working television, outdoor furniture, library area/reading materials), and  			 availability of physical amenities (e.g., comfortable furniture, seating area  			 in lounge/community room, small tables in the lounge) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other structural aspects</b> such as staffing levels and  			 qualifications and staff training. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The process quality measures in our analysis included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>"Homelikeness" of the environment</b>, characterized by an  			 environmental diversity measure that incorporated elements such as presence of  			 personal possessions in the residents' rooms and diversity of style and color  			 of furnishings throughout the facility </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Physical attractiveness</b> and cleanliness of the facility  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Staff knowledge</b> of basic care procedures, monitoring, and  			 medication administration and of normal processes of aging </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Staff familiarity</b> with the ombudsman program </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Availability of services</b> such as assistance with ADLs,  			 medication monitoring, nursing care, recreational activities, and  			 transportation. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Resident-level quality measures incorporated items about care needs and  		resident satisfaction with various aspects of the facility's environment and  		care. These included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Unmet care needs</b> for assistive devices, personal care, and  			 health care. The latter two measures showed little variation and were dropped  			 from the multivariate analysis as a result. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Resident satisfaction</b>, for example, with meals or the  			 physical environment </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Resident autonomy</b> and choices </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Residents' rights</b> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Availability of, and participation in</b>, activities. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Three types of measures were constructed from these indicators. In some  		instances, individual indicators were used in the analysis (e.g., whether  		operators had training in care for the elderly and disabled prior to assuming  		their duties in the facility). In other instances, multiple related items were  		aggregated into summary scales. Items were not used in a common scale unless  		the items demonstrated internal consistency (i.e., Cronbach's Alpha for the  		scale exceeded .6).</p>
<p>In the analyses, these multiple item scales were represented in two  		ways. For all scales (e.g., safety of the environment), the percent of scale  		items present was used as the indicator. For some of these scales, facilities  		in the bottom quintile (20 percent) of the distribution of the scale were  		identified as "lower quality" facilities and distinguished from the facilities  		arrayed in the other four quintiles.</p>
<h4>3.3.2 Covariates</h4>
<p>The main goal of the analysis was to examine the effect of extensive  		regulation and of licensure on quality. Thus, we did not conduct extensive  		analyses of all factors associated with quality. However, prior research  		suggested that some facility characteristics might affect our quality measures,  		independently of the effects of licensure and extensive regulation. Thus, to  		control for potential confounding factors, we constructed a number of variables  		for inclusion in the multivariate analyses. These covariates described several  		characteristics of the homes and residents. For facility- and staff-level  		analyses, we included variables that characterized the size of the facility and  		whether the facility contained only apartments. The facility-level covariates  		included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>An "<b>apartments-only</b>" indicator that characterized the board  			 and care home that had only private apartments </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <b>size</b> variable that indicated whether the home was small  			 (2-10 beds), medium (11-50 beds), or large (51+ beds).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <b>resident-payer mix</b> indicator that was a three-level  			 categorical variable, with <b>high-SSI</b> defined as 80 percent or more of the  			 residents with Supplemental Security Income (SSI) as the payer, <b>low-SSI</b>  			 defined as 20 percent or fewer of the residents having SSI as the payer, and a  			 third category as 21 to 79 percent SSI.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In the resident-level analyses we included these facility-level  		covariates (e.g., size, apartment only, resident payer-mix) and resident-level  		covariates (e.g., mental health status, cognitive status, age of resident,  		length of stay in the facility). Resident-level covariates categorize residents  		by the following characteristics:</p>
<ul><li><b>Elderly</b> (65 or older) or <b>non-elderly</b> </li>
<li>Having or not having a "<b>mental, emotional or nervous  		  condition</b>" </li>
<li><b>Cognitively impaired</b> or intact </li>
<li><b>Length of stay</b> less than 1 year or longer than 1 year. </li>
</ul><h3><a name="sec3.4" id="sec3.4">3.4 Analysis Strategy</a></h3>
<p>The first steps in the analyses involved developing descriptive  		statistics on the study population. The second step required the construction  		of indicators of quality of care. Finally, to study the relationship between  		regulation, licensure, and quality of care at both the facility and the  		resident level, we used multivariate modeling techniques that controlled for  		multiple explanatory variables. For continuous quality measures we fit linear  		regression models using ordinary least squares (OLS). When an outcome was  		binary, logistic regression was used.</p>
<p>At the facility and staff level we first fit models that assessed the  		effects of licensure status, the regulatory environment, and covariates of  		interest (size of the facility and an indicator of whether the facility  		contained only apartments). These models also included variables (i.e.,  		interaction terms) that allowed us to determine whether the effects of  		licensure and regulatory environment differed according to facility size and  		whether the regulatory environment affected licensed and unlicensed facilities  		differently.</p>
<p>We assessed the significance of the interaction terms. If they were not  		significant, then we dropped them from the model and fit a model that included  		only those indicators representing licensure, regulatory environment, and the  		covariates. If at least one of the interaction terms was significant, we  		retained these variables in the models.</p>
<p>Analyses for resident-level quality measures were guided by a similar  		strategy with one exception: both resident-level and facility-level covariates  		were included in the models. The facility-level covariates in these  		resident-level models included size of the facility, whether the facility  		contained "apartments-only," and a categorical variable that described the  		payor mix of the resident population. Resident-level covariates represented the  		age, cognitive status, mental health status, and length of stay in the facility  		of each resident. We also modified our modeling strategy for the resident level  		to include one additional step. We first assessed the significance of the  		covariates to determine whether to include them in the model that included the  		interaction terms. In a few instances, the modeling strategy deviated from this  		structure. For those cases, the variation in approach is discussed when the  		specific results of those analyses are presented.</p>
<p>All hypothesis testing in this analysis was based on a directional (or  		one-tailed) test of the research hypotheses that licensure and more extensive  		regulation are associated with better quality of care in board and care homes.  		A directional test was used because the research question was whether or not  		regulation had a positive impact on quality--<b>not</b> whether regulation had  		some unspecified effect on quality.</p>
<p>Because the data used in these multivariate analyses were derived from a  		complex multistage sampling design, we conducted the analysis with the Survey  		Data Analysis (SUDAAN) software developed by RTL. SUDAAN produces unbiased  		variance estimates for clustered data.</p>

<p><a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit2">Exhibit 2</a> presents information on the  		characteristics of those receiving services in board and care homes in the 10  		study States. As that exhibit demonstrates, this is a frail and vulnerable  		population comprised largely of elderly women. Two-thirds of board and care  		residents in our 10 States were women. One-third of the residents were 85 years  		old or older and among what has come to be called the "oldest old." Almost  		two-thirds of the residents were over 75 years old. Forty percent showed some  		evidence of cognitive impairment; 29 percent were at least occasionally  		incontinent of bladder or bowel. Twenty percent of the residents needed  		assistance in two or more ADLs.</p>
<p>Not only were these residents often physically or cognitively impaired,  		they were also likely to be unmarried and to be poor. Over half of the  		residents were widowed. Nineteen percent never married, and 14 percent were  		separated or divorced. Only 13 percent of the residents were married at the  		time of the interview. Almost one-third of the residents received Supplemental  		Security Income. In the elderly population as a whole in the United States in  		1992, only 9 percent were poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, and roughly  		one-third of those were in nursing homes. So, as few as 6 percent of  		community-dwelling elderly were receiving Medicaid (Health Care Financing  		Administration, 1995). In our 1993 sample, slightly over one-third of board and  		care residents received Medicaid services.</p>

<p>Given their characteristics, it is not surprising that the residents of  		board and care facilities were relatively heavy users of health services.  		Almost 90 percent had a physician visit in the past 12 months. Close to  		one-third had an overnight stay in a hospital. Twenty-eight percent visited a  		hospital emergency room (E.R.) in the 12 months prior to their interview.</p>
<p>The facilities that provided care for this frail population showed  		considerable variation in size and staffing. As <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit4">Exhibit  		4</a> indicates, 70 percent of the facilities were small (i.e., 2 to 10 beds),  		20 percent were medium-sized (i.e., 11-50 beds), and only 10 percent of  		facilities had more than 50 beds.</p>
<p>There was little variation in ownership arrangement, however. Over 80  		percent of facilities operated as for-profit enterprises. In addition, the  		board and care industry is not immune to the movement toward concentration of  		ownership that one sees in other areas of long-term care. One-third of the  		operators in the sample owned or operated more than one board and care  		facility.</p>
<p>Facilities also demonstrated some measure of specialization in their  		resident mix. Roughly 20 percent of the facilities in the sample were dedicated  		to caring almost exclusively for residents with behavior problems. Fifty-six  		percent had a resident population comprised almost exclusively of the elderly.  		Roughly one-quarter of the homes had some other type of resident mix.</p>

</tr></table><p>Although the facilities in our sample provided room, board, supervision,  		and some personal assistance, their ability to provide more extensive services  		appears limited. For example, only one-fifth of the homes had a licensed nurse  		(e.g., RN, LPN, LVN) on staff. Thus, many of the facilities had residents  		receiving services from outside agencies. Twenty-five percent of the homes had  		residents receiving personal care assistance from an outside source.

Roughly one-third of facilities had  		residents involved in day activities outside the home, while over 40 percent  		had residents receiving case management services.</p>

<p>A wide range of quality measures were used in this effort.  		<a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a> presents descriptive statistics for some of  		those measures. Within the facilities caring for this frail population, a major  		question is the adequacy of staffing and staff training. As indicated in  		<a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit4">Exhibit 4</a>, only 21 percent of facilities have a full-  		or part-time licensed nurse on staff (RN or LPN). In <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a>, we see that only two-thirds of the operators  		have had training in care for the elderly and disabled. In addition, fewer than  		a quarter of the facilities require preservice training of staff. Most staff  		training in facilities is on-the-job training. However, 20 percent of licensed  		facilities and one-third of unlicensed facilities have no training requirements  		for their staff.</p>

</tr></table><p>As part of our survey of staff, we queried them on their knowledge of  		very basic aspects of care practices and monitoring. If they administered  		medications, we also asked about proper medication administration. For example,  		in one such question, we asked whether one should deal with urinary  		incontinence by giving the resident less fluids. On these items, the average  		staff member knew the correct answers only two-thirds of the time. When queried  		about the characteristics of normal aging (e.g., whether incontinence was a  		"normal" part of aging), the staff were correct on only 14 percent of those  		items. These results imply that, although staff have some grasp of the  		specifics of care, they do not have adequate knowledge in some areas; moreover,  		they lack more general knowledge about the aging process. This lack of  		knowledge may hinder them in problem identification and in making judgments  		about referrals for more professional assessment and care.</p>
<p>One of the major concerns related to quality of care in board and care  		facilities involves medication use. Although many of the residents in board and  		care homes receive a range of powerful medications, they do so in an  		environment that is not highly medicalized and is not usually staffed with  		medical professionals. Previous research indicates very high levels of  		psychotropic medication use in this population (Avorn et al., 1989). These  		results are not more reassuring than previous research. Although the potential  		negative sequelae of such drugs are now well known (Harrington et al., 1992),  		41 percent of the residents in our sample were receiving psychotropic  		medications (see Spore et al., 1995a). In addition, one-quarter of the sample  		were receiving at least one drug that is inappropriate for use in the elderly  		(see Spore et al., 1995b).</p>
<p>In constructing many of the quality indicators used in this research,  		multiple item scales were developed. For many of these scales, the score was a  		percentage from zero to 100. That score represented the percentage of features  		in the scale that were present in the home. For example, the average facility  		in our sample had 58 percent of the safety features (e.g., good lighting, smoke  		detectors, nonskid surfaces on steps) included in the safety scale. The average  		facility had 65 percent of the supportive devices (e.g., handrails in bathroom,  		lift bars next to toilet) included in the scale for supportive devices.</p>
<p>Facilities did somewhat better in other areas. The average facility had  		80 percent of the amenities (e.g., comfortable furniture and lounge area with  		small tables) included in the scale. In the average facility, 69 percent of the  		identified social and recreational aids (e.g., working TV, reading material)  		were available. The average facility had a cleanliness score of 72 percent. One  		of the potential advantages of board and care facilities is their approximation  		of a homelike environment in contrast to the "institutional" environment that  		is thought to characterize nursing homes. In our sample, the average facility  		scored 74 on the diversity/homelikeness scale.</p>
<p>Although there may be some concern about the average facility's ability  		to provide the care and monitoring needed by its residents, it does seem that  		the physical environment in most facilities is relatively clean, is somewhat  		homelike, and contains amenities and recreational aids that may enhance  		residents' quality of life.</p>
<h3><a name="sec4.3" id="sec4.3">4.3 Effects of Regulation on Quality of  		Care</a></h3>
<h4>4.3.1 Relationship Between Licensure and Extensive  		Regulation</h4>
<p>In the bulk of the analyses that follow, whether a facility is licensed  		and whether a facility operates in a State with an extensive regulatory system  		are discussed separately. However, they are not truly independent of one  		another. Through a combination of network and snowball sampling in the 10 study  		States, the research team estimated there were 13,189 facilities, both licensed  		and unlicensed, that met our criteria for inclusion in the sample of board and  		care facilities (Iannacchione et al., 1994; Wildfire et al., 1995). As  		<a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit6">Exhibit 6</a> indicates, 88 percent of these facilities  		were licensed. However, the prevalence of licensed facilities varied  		significantly according to whether a State had an extensive or limited  		regulatory system for board and care. A facility in a State with extensive  		regulation was in ore than three times as likely to be licensed as a facility  		in a State with limited regulation. In States with limited regulation, 25  		percent of facilities were unlicensed. In States with extensive regulation,  		only 5 percent were unlicensed.</p>

</tr></table><p>This relationship emphasizes the fact that licensure is simply one facet  		of regulation. In the analysis reported below, when one looks for the effect of  		regulation in general, the effects of both licensure and the extensiveness of  		the specific regulatory scheme must be considered.</p>
<h4>4.3.2 Effects of Regulation on Structural Indicators of  		Quality</h4>
<p>Structural indicators of quality capture the resources available to  		provide good care. Thus, our analysis of structural measures of quality focused  		on the effects of regulation on staff qualifications and the physical  		environment in which care occurred. The analysis included three measures of  		staff resources:</p>
<ul><li>Whether the operator had training in care for the elderly and  		  disabled </li>
<li>Whether preservice training was required for caregiving staff </li>
<li>Whether a licensed nurse was on staff in the facility. </li>
</ul><p><a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit7">Exhibit 7</a> presents the multivariate results  		concerning the effects of regulation on staff qualifications. This exhibit  		reports the adjusted relative odds-ratios and their probability values from the  		logistic regressions used in this analysis. Regulation had a statistically  		significant positive effect on only one of the three indicators of staff  		resources.</p>
<p>Both licensure and extensive regulation independently made it more  		likely that an operator had training in the care of the elderly and disabled.  		Operators in licensed homes were over 10 times more likely to report relevant  		training than were operators in unlicensed facilities. Operators in States with  		extensive regulations were almost twice as likely to report care training than  		were their counterparts in States with limited regulation.</p>

</tr></table><p>Other factors that affected the likelihood that an operator would have  		care training were facility size and whether the facility comprised apartments  		only. Operators in facilities with between 11 and 50 beds were more likely to  		have training, as were operators of what are basically assisted living  		settings.</p>
<p>None of the variables in our model has a significant effect on whether a  		facility required preservice training of caregivers, and only facility size  		affected the likelihood that a resident would be in a facility with a licensed  		nurse on staff. Residents residing in small homes with from 2 to 10 beds were  		only 20 percent as likely as residents in large facilities of more than 50 beds  		to be in a facility with a licensed nurse on staff.</p>
<p>Our analysis of indicators of structural quality also included an  		analysis of the effects of regulation on four dimensions of the physical  		environment in the sampled homes. These included:</p>
<ul><li>Percentage of safety features available (e.g., smoke detectors, fire  		  extinguishers) </li>
<li>Percentage of physical amenities in the home (e.g., comfortable  		  furniture, adequate space) </li>
<li>Percentage of supportive devices available (e.g., handrails, support  		  bars) </li>
<li>Percentage of social and recreational aids in the home (e.g.,  		  television, radio, outdoor furniture). </li>
</ul><p>The results of our analysis are presented in <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit8">Exhibit  		8</a>. Since the dependent variables in these analyses were continuous, or  		quasi-continuous, ordinary least squares regression models were estimated. The  		standardized regression coefficients and their probabilities for each variable  		in our model are displayed in the exhibit.</p>
<p>The degree to which facilities provide appropriate safety features was  		clearly affected by a facility's licensure status. Licensed facilities had  		significantly more of these safety features than did unlicensed facilities. The  		other aspects of regulation (i.e., extensiveness) had no significant effect on  		safety features. The only other factor that had a significant effect on  		facility safety was facility size. Smaller and medium-sized facilities had  		significantly fewer safety features than did large facilities. Those homes that  		included only apartments were no different from more traditional board and care  		facilities in their scores on facility safety.</p>

</tr></table><p>The percentage of potential social and recreational aids was also  		affected by regulation. Both licensed facilities and facilities in States with  		extensive regulatory systems had significantly more social and recreational  		aids available for resident use. Again, size also played a role. Small  		facilities had significantly fewer social and recreational aids than did large  		facilities.</p>
<p>Licensure also had a positive impact on the availability of supportive  		devices. The effect of extensive regulation, however, varied by the size of the  		facility. Significant differences in the availability of supportive devices did  		not appear between large and medium-sized facilities in States with extensive  		regulation and those with limited regulation. However, in the availability of  		supportive devices, small homes in States with extensive regulation scored 10  		percent higher than did small homes in States with limited regulation.</p>
<p>In the availability of physical amenities, apartment settings seemed to  		have significantly more amenities than traditional board and care homes.  		However, regulation did not enhance this dimension of quality. Licensed  		facilities did not differ from unlicensed facilities. And, the results indicate  		again that the effect of regulation in this domain varied by facility size. In  		this instance, regulation had a negative effect for some facilities.  		Medium-sized homes in extensively regulated States scored significantly lower  		on the physical amenities scale than did comparably sized homes in States with  		limited regulation (ß=-7.0, <i>p</i>=.03).</p>
<p>The results in <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit8">Exhibit 8</a> refer to the effects of  		our independent variables on facilities' average scores on our sc ales.  		Inherent in this analysis is the concept that regulation's effect will lower or  		increase quality in the "average facility." There is an alternative conceptual  		model for the effects of regulation. Some would argue that regulation's real  		effect is in setting a "floor" below which quality is not allowed to fall.  		<a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit9">Exhibit 9</a> displays the results of an analysis  		consistent with this alternative concept of regulation's role. In that exhibit,  		we present the results of logistic regression analyses, estimating the effects  		of regulation on the likelihood that a facility will fall into the bottom 20  		percent on our four measures of the quality of the physical environment.</p>
<p>Both licensure status and size had an effect on how likely a facility  		was to fall into the bottom quintile on our measure of safety features.  		Licensed facilities were much less likely to be among those with the poorest  		safety ratings. Small facilities were much more likely to have the poorest  		ratings on safety. Licensed facilities, along with facilities comprised of  		apartments only, were also significantly less likely to be in the bottom  		quintile of the physical amenities scale. Licensed facilities were also half as  		likely to have the lowest scores on the availability of social and recreational  		aids.</p>
<p>Over and above the effects of licensure, regulatory stringency had a  		relatively complex set of effects on whether facilities scored among the worst  		scores on our indicators of the quality of the physical environment. Among  		these indicators, the effects of extensive regulation varied by the size of the  		facility. Small homes in States with extensive regulation were 50 percent less  		likely (<i>p</i>=.01) to be in the bottom quintile of facilities on our scale  		indicating the availability of supportive devices. Small and medium-sized  		facilities in States with extensive regulations were significantly less likely  		(OR=0.4, <i>p</i>=.00; OR=0.2, <i>p</i>=.02; respectively) to have the poorest  		scores on the availability of social and recreational aids.</p>

</tr></table><p>The one somewhat anomalous finding related to regulation arises in the  		analysis of the availability of supportive devices. On this indicator, large  		facilities in extensively regulated environments are significantly more likely  		to score among the lowest 20 percent of facilities. This result may be a  		function of the inclusion in the sample of large assisted living or multilevel  		campuses, which are usually located in States with limited regulation. Such  		facilities may have more supportive devices than the larger traditional board  		and care facilities.</p>
<p>In general, both the extensiveness of the regulatory structure and  		licensure had a positive impact on our indicators of structural quality.  		Licensure's effect was always an "across-the-board" effect that was uniformly  		positive across the various types of facilities. The extensiveness of the  		regulatory structure had a more complex effect on these measures. In some  		instances, such as operator training and the availability of social and  		recreational aids, the degree of regulation had a uniformly positive effect.  		More often, however, the effect of the extensiveness of regulations was  		conditioned by the size of the facility.</p>
<h4>4.3.3 Effects of Regulation on Indicators of Process  		Quality</h4>
<p>The process quality indicators addressed in our analysis dealt with  		staff knowledge of the ombudsman program, of basic care and monitoring, and of  		the normal aging process. Staff qualifications and training were considered  		structural measures of quality, but these knowledge indicators are classified  		as measures of process quality. Although training and qualifications may  		translate into different processes of care, the nexus between differential  		knowledge and differences in the process of care is much stronger. So, we have  		placed these indicators among our measures of process quality, although we  		recognize that some might argue that they belong elsewhere.</p>
<p>Licensure's effect on knowledge of the ombudsman program varied  		relatively dramatically by the nature of the regulatory environment in which  		the facility operated. Staff in licensed homes in States with extensive  		regulation were over 18 times more likely to know about the ombudsman program  		than were staff in unlicensed facilities in States with limited regulation of  		the board and care industry (OR=18.4, <i>p</i>=0.00). There were no significant  		differences in the knowledge levels of staff in licensed and unlicensed homes  		in States with limited regulation (OR= 1.6, <i>p</i>=.43). Staff in smaller  		facilities were twice as likely to know about the ombudsman program than were  		staff in either medium-sized or large facilities.

</tr></table><p>Staff knowledge of basic care, monitoring, and medication administration  		was unaffected by any aspect of regulation. Facility characteristics, however,  		played a significant role in staff knowledge in this area. Staff in larger  		facilities were roughly twice as likely to possess this knowledge than were  		staff in medium-sized or small facilities. Staff in apartment-only settings  		were almost twice as likely to have this knowledge than were staff in more  		traditional board and care homes.</p>
<p>The only factor that had a significant effect on knowledge of the normal  		aging process was the licensure status of the facility. Staff in licensed  		facilities were significantly less likely to understand the normal aging  		process. Though the differences in case-mix between licensed and unlicensed  		homes were relatively complex, it may be that staff in licensed homes see a  		more impaired elderly population than do staff in unlicensed facilities. This  		may somewhat distort their perceptions of the normal course of aging.</p>
<p>The three other indicators of the quality of the process of care used in  		the analysis were multiple item scales that reflected the cleanliness or  		attractiveness of the homes, the services available for residents, and the  		diversity of the environment. The indicators of diversity included in our scale  		referred to the degree to which the environment in the home diverged from what  		one would expect in an "institutional" setting and converged with one's  		expectations for a more homelike setting.</p>
<p>The only factor that seems to have had a significant effect on the  		cleanliness and attractiveness of facilities was their size. Larger facilities  		were significantly cleaner and more attractive. The diversity of the  		environment in the home, however, was unaffected by facility size. Instead, as  		one might expect, facilities that included only apartments developed  		significantly more homelike settings.</p>
<p>Since many observers fear that regulation and licensure lead to a more  		"institutional," less homelike environment, we examined the impact of licensure  		on environmental diversity. Using criteria established by Moos and Lemke  		(1978), licensure was not significantly associated with a more institutional  		environment. In fact, licensed facilities in States with extensive regulations  		had overall environmental diversity scores almost 15 percent higher than  		unlicensed facilities (<i>p</i>=0.00). In States with limited regulation, there  		was no significant difference between the environmental diversity of licensed  		and unlicensed homes (<a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit11">Exhibit 11</a>).</p>
<p>Service availability was significantly lower in facilities with only 2  		to 10 beds and in unlicensed facilities.</p>

</tr></table><p>As with the earlier scales representing structural quality, with these  		scales related to process quality we also tested to determine effects of  		regulation on facilities' likelihood of falling into the bottom 20 percent of  		the sample. These results are presented in <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit12">Exhibit 12</a>.  		With cleanliness and attractiveness, medium-sized facilities were significantly  		more likely than other facilities to have poorer scores on the scale. Also,  		those facilities comprised of only apartments were more likely to have the  		poorest scores on cleanliness and attractiveness. Neither the extensiveness of  		regulation nor licensure had a significant effect on the likelihood that homes  		would have among the poorest scores on attractiveness/cleanliness.</p>
<p>The effects of licensure and regulation on low scores on environmental  		diversity were not uniform across all settings. But again, one finds the least  		likelihood that a facility will have a relatively poor score on diversity among  		those facilities in which some would expect the most institution-like setting.  		In extensively regulated States, licensed facilities were significantly less  		likely (OR=0.2, <i>p</i>=0.00) to have the lowest scores on environmental  		diversity. Also, homes with between 11 and 50 beds were, in general, two and  		one-half times more likely to score relatively poorly on environmental  		diversity.</p>

</tr></table><p>In reviewing the effects of licensure and regulation on our indicators  		of process quality, the picture is somewhat more complex than that seen with  		the measures of structural quality. None of the positive effects of regulation  		are simple, direct effects. Instead, positive effects in this area seem to most  		often result from the combined effects of licensure and extensive regulation.  		Neither dimension of regulation, in isolation, has a significant positive  		effect on our indicators of process quality.</p>
<h4>4.3.4 Effects of Regulation on Resident-Level Quality  		Indicators</h4>
<p>In analyzing the effects of regulation on our resident-level quality  		indicators, we first focused on medication use. With our other resident-level  		measures, the emphasis was on resident needs, their satisfaction, their  		involvement in activities, and their ability to exercise their rights. The  		models used in these analyses differ somewhat from our earlier models, which  		focused more heavily on facility characteristics. With these models, it was  		important that a number of individual-level covariates be added to the models.  		Our outcome measures are largely individual characteristics or attitudes and,  		as such, demand that individual attributes be added to the models to control  		for individual differences.</p>
<p>A variety of major concerns about the process of care in board and care  		homes have arisen around the use and potential misuse of medications. Previous  		research has demonstrated that psychoactive medications are quite prevalent in  		board and care homes (Avorn et al., 1989; Dittmar, 1989; Williams et al.,  		1992). There has also been concern about the general prescribing patterns and  		medication management for the elderly as a whole (Beers and Ouslander, 1989;  		Cooper 1991; Montamat and Cusack, 1992) and in board and care facilities in  		particular (Avorn et al., 1989; Eckel and Crawley, 1971; Williams et al.,  		1992). A major issue, then, is the effect of regulation on medication use in  		our study sample.</p>
<p>The results of our analysis of the effects of regulation on psychotropic  		drug use are presented in <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit13">Exhibit 13</a>. The model for  		this analysis differed somewhat from that used in other analyses. First, these  		analyses were limited to residents in licensed facilities. Regulatory  		stringency was expected to affect drug prescription and use patterns in  		licensed facilities more heavily. Also, the greater number of degrees of  		freedom offered by focusing only on residents in licensed facilities allowed  		greater flexibility in choosing covariates to adjust for differences among  		residents that might affect their likelihood of receiving a psychotropic drug.  		As the results in <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit13">Exhibit 13</a> indicate, residents with  		a current mental health condition, cognitive impairment, or a previous stay in  		a psychiatric hospital were two and one-third times more likely to receive a  		prescription for psychotropic medications than were other residents. Younger  		residents were slightly less likely to receive these drugs. Gender had no  		effect on the likelihood that one would receive a psychotropic drug.</p>

</tr></table><p>The results also indicate that, in States with more limited regulatory  		structures, residents in licensed facilities were almost twice as likely to  		receive psychotropic medication. The odds of residents receiving a psychotropic  		drug in States with limited regulation are 85 percent higher than the odds of  		similar residents in States with extensive regulation receiving a prescription  		for such a drug.</p>
<p>Inappropriate drug prescription patterns in general were also  		investigated. The identification of such patterns is difficult. In our  		research, we used two different sets of criteria to identify inappropriate drug  		'prescription patterns. The first of these was suggested by Beers et al.  		(1991). Using an expert-based consensus process that focused on inappropriate  		drug use for elderly nursing home residents, drugs that should be avoided  		entirely or are inappropriate because of dosage or duration of use were  		identified. The second set of criteria was developed by Stuck et al. (1994) for  		use with community-dwelling elders. However, the latter set of criteria  		contains only drugs that should be avoided entirely. For simplicity, these two  		sets of criteria will simply be called the Beers' and Stucks' criteria.</p>
<p><a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit14">Exhibit 14</a> presents the percentage of  		prescriptions found using each set of criteria for residents in facilities in  		States with limited regulation and residents in facilities in States with  		extensive regulation. Using both sets of criteria, extensive regulation seemed  		to reduce the residents' risk of receiving a prescription for an inappropriate  		drug. Residents in facilities in States with more extensive regulation were  		less likely to receive inappropriate medications. However, the differences were  		statistically significant only for the somewhat more inclusive Beers' criteria,  		which include drugs that are contraindicated entirely for the elderly and those  		contraindicated in relation to dosage. With the Beers' criteria, the raw  		difference of 7.0 percent between residents living in different regulatory  		environments indicates that the prevalence of residents with an inappropriate  		prescription is 31 percent higher in States with limited regulation.</p>

Licensure had no effect on residents' perceived needs for  		assistive devices. However, residents in facilities with extensive regulation  		were two and one-half times more likely to indicate that they needed an  		assistive device, such as eyeglasses, hearing aid, cane, walker, or wheelchair.  		Although the stringency of regulation had no effect on residents' satisfaction  		with meals, licensure did have a significant effect. Residents in licensed  		facilities were more than three times more likely to voice dissatisfaction with  		meals. Neither regulation nor licensure had a significant effect on residents'  		satisfaction with their physical environment. In addition, none of the tested  		interactions involving these variables was significant for any of the three  		indicators.</p>
<p>The bulk of the factors that affected these measures were individual  		characteristics. In these three models, nine parameters were statistically  		significant.

</tr></table><p>Two other resident-level quality indicators were used to evaluate the  		effects of regulation on the degree to which residents engaged in activities.  		One of these measures represents the number of different activities (including  		both individual and group activities) in which residents were engaged in the 14  		days prior to the interview. The other measure reflects whether or not the  		resident made any trips outside the facility, other than to appointments for  		health care, during the 2 weeks prior to the assessment.</p>
<p>The results presented in <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit16">Exhibit 16</a> indicate  		that residents in licensed facilities reported significantly lower levels of  		activity involvement than did those in unlicensed facilities. Licensure had no  		effect on activity levels outside the home. Regulatory stringency affected  		activity pursuits in the larger facilities. Residents in large facilities in  		extensively regulated States reported greater activity involvement  		(ß=0.13, <i>p</i>=0.02) than residents in large facilities in States with  		limited regulation. However, these same residents were significantly less  		likely to report activity outside the home (OR=.4, <i>p</i>=0.01).</p>
<p>Activity levels are also affected by a number of other variables in the  		models. Residents are less likely to participate in activities outside the home  		if they have been in residence for less than 1 year. They participate in more  		activities in the home if they reside in an apartment-only setting, if they are  		younger, if they have been in the facility for less than 1 year, and if they  		are cognitively impaired.</p>

</tr></table><p>Perceived respect for residents' rights is largely a function of  		individual characteristics. As <a href="report-effects-regulation-quality-care-analysis-effect-regulation-quality-care-board-and-care-homes.html#Exhibit17">Exhibit 17</a> indicates,  		residents in licensed facilities are less likely to have access to the kitchen  		to fix snacks, but that is the only significant impact for regulation. Living  		in an apartment is also a significant factor in autonomy, although the results  		are somewhat mixed. In apartments, residents logically have greater kitchen  		access, but they report less choice over their daily activities or autonomy in  		decision making. Facility or home size is also important. In small homes,  		residents are more likely to have access to the kitchen, but they are less  		likely to make decisions about their daily routine. Smaller homes are also less  		likely to have a residents' council. Individual resident characteristics (e.g.,  		mental condition, cognitive status) also play a role in perceived autonomy and  		kitchen access.</p>

<p>This section summarizes the major findings of the study of the effect of  		regulation on board and care home quality and discusses their implications.</p>
<h3><a name="sec5.1" id="sec5.1">5.1 Putting Effects of Regulation in  		Context: Key Descriptive Findings</a></h3>
<p>Several descriptive findings emphasize how board and care homes have  		changed over the past decade. These findings also provide a context for the  		policy implications discussed below.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The average resident was significantly older and more disabled than  			 was true a decade ago. This more impaired population presents more complex  			 caregiving challenges to providers and staff and makes issues related to  			 quality assurance more pressing for public policy-makers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although there is a perception that board and care consists of  			 small, private family homes, most residents lived in fairly large facilities.  			 Although most homes were small, the majority of residents were in places with  			 more than 50 beds. This presents challenges in terms of offering residents a  			 homelike, noninstitutional environment and also raises issues related to safety  			 and staffing requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We did find a substantial number of unlicensed homes. In the 10  			 study States, an estimated 12 percent of the homes and 27 percent of the beds  			 were in unlicensed board and care homes. Addressing the role of these homes and  			 issues related to the needs of residents for the protection afforded by  			 licensure is critical for many States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the past decade, a new type of unlicensed home emerged:  			 retirement apartments and places called assisted living facilities that provide  			 the same services as licensed homes (meals, protective oversight, and personal  			 care) but are not licensed. They tend to be large, to house mainly elderly  			 residents, and to house few residents who are poor or near poor. Understanding  			 their role in providing long-term care and their potential to meet the needs of  			 a range of persons with disabilities, especially those with moderate and low  			 incomes, is critical.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Each of these factors, discovered during the course of the study,  		increases the importance of the study's findings on the effect of regulation  		and the ability of the States to ensure adequate care for the elderly and  		disabled who reside in board and care homes. In particular, the finding of an  		increasing disability level among residents makes issues of safety and quality  		assurance especially pressing. Further, both the presence of large numbers of  		unlicensed homes and the emergence of a new type of unlicensed home resurrect  		questions about the role of the States in extending their regulatory reach to  		cover these places that provide essentially the same type of care and services  		to the elderly and disabled as licensed board and care homes.</p>
<h3><a name="sec5.2" id="sec5.2">5.2 Summary of Study Findings</a></h3>
<h4>5.2.1 Positive Effects of Regulation on Quality</h4>
<p>Regulation was associated with better quality in a number of areas. Four  		findings are particularly relevant.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Licensure alone was effective in ensuring that homes provided  			 care above a threshold of minimum performance.</b></p>
<p>Many observers believe that this prevention of performance below  			 some minimally acceptable level of quality is the main role of regulation. The  			 minimum requirements of licensure, whether in States with extensive or limited  			 regulatory systems, prevented homes from having the worst performance along key  			 quality dimensions, including low prevalence of safety features, social aids,  			 supportive devices, and physical amenities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Extensive regulatory systems reduced the prevalence of unlicensed  			 homes.</b></p>
<p>By having a broad definition of places that required an operating  			 license and by enforcing licensure, States with extensive regulatory systems  			 reduced the prevalence of unlicensed homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Extensive regulatory systems and licensure were effective in  			 promoting better safety, quality of life, and quality of care.</b></p>
<p>For some aspects of quality, the basic elements of the study States'  			 licensure requirements alone, whether in conjunction with an extensive or  			 limited regulatory system, were sufficient to promote higher quality. For other  			 aspects of quality, the additional components of extensive regulatory systems  			 were needed to achieve better quality.</p>
<ul><li>Licensure, regardless of the type of regulatory system, was  				associated with:
<ul><li>A higher percentage of safety features in homes </li>
<li>
<p>Greater availability of an array of supportive long-term  						care services, such as personal care, special diets, transportation to medical  						and dental appointments, and, when needed, nursing care. </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extensive regulatory systems were associated with important  				aspects of better quality, including:
<ul><li>Lower use of psychotropic drugs </li>
<li>Lower use of medications that are inappropriate for use with  					 the elderly </li>
<li>
<p>Greater availability of social and recreational aids.  						</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Licensure and extensive regulation combined were associated with:
<ul><li>Increased staff knowledge of, and willingness to refer  					 problems to, the ombudsman program </li>
<li>Greater likelihood that operators are trained in the care of  					 the elderly and disabled </li>
<li>
<p>Greater availability of supportive services. </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Regulation achieved positive effects on quality without producing  			 an excessively institutional model of care.</b></p>
<p>Despite fears that regulation would lead to an institutional model  			 of care, licensed homes and homes in States with extensive regulatory systems  			 were not more likely to be "institutional." Instead, they tended to be.  			 smaller, to have greater environmental diversity, and to make more social and  			 recreational aids available to residents.</p>
</li>
</ol><h4>5.2.2 Interaction Effects</h4>
<p>As noted, some effects of regulation occur only in specific settings  		(e.g., occur only in licensed facilities in States with extensive regulatory  		systems), while others are conditioned by the size of the home. For example,  		small homes in States with extensive regulatory systems were more likely to  		make a wider array of supportive devices available to residents compared to  		small homes in States with limited regulatory systems; however, extensive  		regulation had no effect on this quality measure in medium or large-sized  		homes. Such findings suggest that regulatory systems are multifaceted and do  		not affect all homes in exactly the same way. Sometimes this occurs because of  		differences in the standards, sometimes because the standards are applied  		differently by the inspectors or enforcement personnel, and sometimes because  		intrinsic characteristics of the homes intervene in significant ways.  		Similarly, the finding that licensure often has an effect only in States with  		extensive regulatory systems suggests that, in these cases, the basic licensure  		requirements shared by most or all States are not sufficient to produce the  		observed difference in quality and that the key factor lies in the standards,  		inspection, or enforcement provisions. Thus, States that wish to use the  		study's empirical findings to guide specific policy decisions would do well to  		examine quite carefully the effects and the interactions between regulation,  		licensure, and facility size.</p>
<h4>5.2.3 No Effect of Regulation on Some Aspects of  		Quality</h4>
<p>Regulation did not produce positive effects on all the aspects of  		quality we studied. Instead, such factors as home size and whether it was an  		"apartment-type" board and care home, as well as some resident characteristics,  		were associated with some differences in quality. Measures on which regulation  		had no effect include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Operator requirements on preservice and in-service training for  			 staff </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff knowledge of basic care procedures and appropriate monitoring  			 of health conditions, characteristics of normal aging, and medication  			 administration </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability of licensed nurses on staff </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleanliness and "attractiveness" of the home </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability of physical amenities. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, as noted, there was little variation in measures of unmet  		care needs, residents' rights, and "satisfaction" with facility performance.  		The implications of these findings are discussed below.</p>
<h3><a name="sec5.3" id="sec5.3">5.3 Limitations of the Study</a></h3>
<p>The study design has several strengths, the most significant of which is  		that it enabled us to analyze the components of each State's regulatory system  		and to categorize States based on key characteristics of their systems for  		regulating board and care homes. This allowed us to select States at either end  		of the regulatory continuum so as to maximize the likelihood of detecting the  		effect of regulation on quality if such an effect were present. Indeed, this  		may well account for the fact that this study found a wider array of positive  		effects than prior studies have detected.</p>
<p>At the same time, the study design has some limitations as a result of  		its focus on assessing the effects of regulation and differences between  		licensed and unlicensed homes. These too have important implications for  		policy-makers.</p>
<p>First, our study does not attempt to determine what the "absolute"  		quality of care is, that is, whether care in board and care homes across the  		country is excellent, adequate, or very poor. We know that it is "better," on  		average, in States with extensive regulatory systems and in licensed homes. We  		do not know, however, what that means in terms of some normative standard of  		"good quality." This is important, since some of the study findings may raise  		questions about the adequacy of care and because the cross-sectional nature of  		the study design prevented us from assessing a full range of quality measures,  		such as resident outcomes. Further, our measures of unmet care needs and  		resident-level quality indicators largely depended on resident self-report.  		These measures do not address such issues for residents with cognitive  		impairment. Because such residents represent 40 percent of the study sample and  		because their impairment makes them particularly vulnerable to unmet care needs  		and poor care, this is a significant limitation. <b>Thus, the study does not  		answer the question of whether care in board and care homes is acceptable, nor  		whether other important aspects of quality will respond similarly to current  		regulatory structures.</b></p>
<p>Second, the approach of selecting five States with limited regulatory  		systems and five with extensive regulatory systems means that the study cannot  		address some questions policy-makers will have. For example, although we can  		assess the relative effects on quality of extensive versus limited regulatory  		systems, we cannot address the effects of the mid-range of regulatory systems.  		In addition, because we rated States on multiple aspects of their regulatory  		systems (i.e., aspects of licensure, inspections, and enforcement), we cannot  		say which aspects of regulation had the greatest effect in terms of better  		quality. <b>This means that we cannot say with certainty which regulatory,  		features are the most important nor how States should structure their  		regulatory systems</b>. Instead, we can suggest only that States wishing to  		improve quality carefully review all the features of the regulatory systems in  		the 10 study States (U.S. DHHS, 1990; Hawes et al., 1993) and make reasoned  		decisions about which system differences are the most likely to produce the  		biggest changes.</p>
<p>Third, the study design does not fully address the potential effect of  		other factors on quality differences. As noted above in the discussion of the  		results and as presented in <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/stumthes.htm"><i>Report on Study  		Methods</i></a> (Hawes et al., 1995), we recognized the potential role of such  		other factors as State supplemental payments (SSP) to board and care homes. Our  		design did not allow for us to independently assess the effect of this factor;  		however, we did deliberately select some States with limited regulatory systems  		and above-average SSP and some States with extensive regulatory systems and  		below-average SSP. Further, we did attempt to control for the effect of payment  		level in the analysis by including a covariate on each facility's SSI/SSP  		utilization rate when estimating the effects of regulation and licensure. As  		noted, the SSI/SSP utilization level (high/medium/low) did not change the  		relationships we found between extensive regulation and quality nor between  		licensure and quality. <b>This does not mean that there is no relationship  		between payment policy (level or system type) and facility performance, which  		is an issue that is beyond the scope of this study.</b></p>
<h3><a name="sec5.4" id="sec5.4">5.4 Implications of Study  		Findings</a></h3>
<h4>5.4.1 General Implications</h4>
<p>The study findings have several important implications for key  		participants in the board and care sector. Study findings point to a board and  		care population that is considerably older and more frail and disabled than it  		was a decade ago. Also, the mix of physically frail elderly, cognitively  		impaired elderly, and residents with mental illness and developmental  		disabilities, some of whom are non-elderly, presents a complex caregiving  		challenge. These factors should prompt a reexamination of the health and safety  		issues that confront the board and care home providers and the States' systems  		for regulating the industry. Of primary importance are the range of services,  		staffing patterns, and staff training and knowledge needed to meet the needs of  		today's residents.</p>
<h4>5.4.2 Implications of Findings About "No Effect"</h4>
<p>Several implications can be drawn from the study findings about aspects  		of quality that were largely unaffected by the nature of the regulatory system  		or licensure. The first is that traditional measures of satisfaction, for all  		their current "vogue," may not be useful in assessing quality of care or life  		in facilities. Two factors support this. First, there is a well-established  		"positivity bias" among recipients of any services (i.e., there is a strong  		tendency for recipients to positively value any service when asked about  		satisfaction). Second, expectations play a key role in determining an  		individual's report of satisfaction (e.g., the match between expectations and  		"reality" may be more important than the actual "quality" of the service). In  		addition, in a time of fiscal constraint, policy-makers may be loathe to  		allocate increased funds in an effort to increase a resident's rating from  		"satisfied" to "very satisfied." Thus, one interpretation of some of the  		findings of little or no effect is that we should be untroubled about the  		finding and continue to seek more effective ways of capturing residents' own  		views about the quality of care they receive.</p>
<p>A second interpretation from these findings is that we do not know  		whether regulation is <b>incapable</b> of affecting these aspects of quality or  		whether the particular regulatory structures currently in place in most board  		and care facilities are poorly designed to ensure better quality in these  		areas. For example, the finding on operator training suggests that regulation  		is capable of ensuring that providers receive more training. On the other hand,  		the findings about lack of staff knowledge suggest one of two things: either  		regulations cannot affect this--or the regulatory system is aimed at the wrong  		target. One might hypothesize that if a State wishes to affect knowledge, it  		might specify the information and knowledge base a staff caregiver must  		possess, inspect or test to determine whether this knowledge is acquired and  		held by staff, and enforce the requirement by penalizing homes that fail to  		have knowledgeable staff. This sort of requirement stands in contrast to both  		the lack of specific staff training requirements in some States and also to the  		"mere" requirements in other States that staff receive a certain number of  		hours of training (or that, in addition, certain topics must be covered).  		Further, these are all removed from any requirement that residents receive a  		certain kind of care that embodies the needed knowledge base (e.g., a  		requirement that facilities help residents attain and maintain maximum  		practicable functioning and be treated with respect). Unfortunately, the  		current study cannot provide an empirical basis for interpreting these  		findings.</p>
<h4>5.4.3 Specific Implications of Positive Effects</h4>
<p>There are four specific implications from the study.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>States can improve many aspects of the quality of care in board  			 and care homes through appropriate regulation.</b></p>
<p>The findings show that extensive regulation produced changes in  			 several key areas. Extensive regulatory systems were associated with lower use  			 of psychotropic medications and lower use of medications inappropriate for the  			 elderly. Given the high rates of psychotropic drug use among residents and the  			 potential for adverse effects on their physical and cognitive functioning and  			 risk for falls, this is particularly significant. Given the limited  			 availability of staff who are adequately trained in monitoring residents for  			 adverse effects of medications, regulatory policies that are associated with  			 lower use of potentially harmful or inappropriate medications are especially  			 important.</p>
<p>In addition, in licensed homes, extensive regulation was associated  			 with other positive effects on quality of care in terms of operator training,  			 greater availability of supportive devices and social aids, and increased staff  			 knowledge of the ombudsman program. The greater availability of such devices is  			 key to supporting the safe daily function of residents with physical  			 disabilities, while social aids are a key part of offering residents  			 opportunities for more social interaction, activities, and enhanced quality of  			 life. Links to the ombudsman program are also important since the role of  			 ombudsmen in long-term care is to support both providers and residents in  			 improving quality and also to complement the activities of the regulatory  			 system.</p>
<p>Extensive regulation was also associated with lower prevalence of  			 unlicensed homes. Thus, the positive effects of licensure are extended to a  			 greater proportion of places providing board and care services to persons with  			 disabilities.</p>
<p>These positive effects are especially compelling because the  			 differences between States with extensive regulatory systems and those with  			 limited systems do not appear to be huge. As noted, the study design does not  			 allow us to identify the effects of each of the factors associated with  			 differences between extensive and limited regulatory systems. However, two key  			 differences do appear to be consistent across these States. One key difference  			 is that States with extensive regulatory systems have a more broadly  			 encompassing set of requirements for the types of places that must be licensed.  			 They extend licensure requirements to both small homes and also to places that  			 house residents in apartments if they provide protective oversight and  			 supportive services or house residents needing such care. A second key  			 difference is that States with extensive regulatory systems have and use a  			 wider array of enforcement remedies or sanctions compared to States with more  			 limited systems. Thus, policy-makers should consider these elements if they  			 wish to change their current regulatory systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>States can improve other aspects of quality by requiring  			 licensure of board and care homes.</b></p>
<p>The basic requirements in licensure laws alone--regardless of  			 whether in States with extensive or limited regulatory systems--serve to  			 prevent the worst performance among homes along a number of important  			 dimensions of quality. They also appear to encourage greater safety in homes,  			 greater availability of a range of supportive long-term care services, and  			 better performance in other areas. Thus, one clear implication is that States  			 may be well served by the simple extension of licensure requirements to all  			 places providing "board and care."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The Federal government can support the efforts of States and  			 providers to improve quality of care by developing and disseminating  			 information.</b></p>
<p>Although States have traditionally assumed the primary  			 responsibility for the provision of board and care services and for regulating  			 homes, the Federal role remains important. The Federal government can continue  			 to develop and disseminate information about changes in the board and care  			 sector. Information can include the changing role of board and care relative to  			 the rest of the long-term care sector, the characteristics and care needs of  			 residents, and the structure of the industry and its capacity to provide  			 appropriate care. Also, it can provide information about the emergence of new  			 modalities of care, such as assisted living, and the implications for the  			 supply, affordability, and quality of long-term care options.</p>
<p>In addition, the Federal government can develop and disseminate  			 information about the States' regulatory and payment policies, and it can  			 sponsor additional studies that more fully address the effects of particular  			 aspects of regulation (e.g., enforcement activities) and of payment policies on  			 quality of care. Finally, the Federal government can develop and disseminate  			 information about innovative models, such as ombudsman training programs for  			 staff and operators, formal contracts between board and care homes and home  			 health providers for the provision of services to residents, the development  			 and functioning of "teaching" board and care homes that serve as resources to  			 other facilities, and other new and promising arrangements for providing  			 long-term care services in residential settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The board and care home industry should work closely with State  			 governments to improve quality of care.</b></p>
<p>This study confirms that there is a well-defined niche or role for  			 board and care homes in the provision of long-term care. Board and care homes  			 fill the niche between residential settings such as congregate apartments and  			 nursing homes. However, the increasing age and disability levels among board  			 and care residents raise health and safety concerns that could best be  			 addressed through collaborative efforts between States and the industry.  			 Historically, regulatory reform in long-term care has been opposed by an  			 industry fearful of "overregulation" and has come about primarily on the heels  			 of scandals about spectacularly bad care. Such an environment seldom fosters  			 careful consideration of the range of regulatory options available and how  			 policies can be structured to support the efforts of good providers while  			 minimizing the prevalence of bad ones. Those members of the board and care  			 industry who consistently provide good care have much to offer policy-makers  			 about the elements of their structure and care process that contribute to  			 appropriate quality of care and life for residents. By taking a "proactive"  			 role in helping define standards and regulatory approaches that promote better  			 quality and minimize the prevalence of bad operators, the industry can help  			 improve regulation without creating an unresponsive and overly burdensome  			 process.</p>
