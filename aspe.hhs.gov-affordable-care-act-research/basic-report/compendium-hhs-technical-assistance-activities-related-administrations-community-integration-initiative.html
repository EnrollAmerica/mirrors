<h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The July 1999 Supreme Court decision in <strong><em>Olmstead v. L. C.</em></strong> challenges not only state governments, but federal and local governments, to increase opportunities for persons with significant disabilities to live where they choose. In response to the direction provided by the Supreme Court in the Olmstead case, all levels of government are increasing their efforts to increase access to long-term supports and services for persons with disabilities in home and community-based settings.</p>
<p>On June 18, 2001, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order No. 13217, Community-Based Alternatives for Individuals with Disabilities. The Order calls upon the federal government to assist states and localities to implement swiftly the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em><strong>Olmstead v. L.C.</strong></em>, stating: The United States is committed to community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities and recognizes that such services advance the best interest of the United States.</p>
<p>To fulfill the mandate of the Presidents Executive Order, the Department of Health and Human Services has established the New Freedom Initiative Workgroup to review efforts that have been already initiated in response to the Olmstead decision, and to recommit and refocus the Administrations efforts in promoting the full participation of adults with disabilities in community life. As part of this effort, members of the New Freedom Initiative Workgroup felt it would be helpful to compile a compendium of selected projects which are currently operational at the federal level to promote the expansion of long term supports and services in community-based settings. For each project, we present information on both the funding and implementing organization, the purpose of the project, a brief description of the activity, and contact information on where people can go to obtain more detailed information about the project. While we have tried to identify the major projects currently in operation at the federal level to support states efforts to expand long-term supports and services for persons with disabilities, the report undoubtedly fails to include <em>all</em> of the activities going on at the federal level in response to the Olmstead decision. The Workgroup plans to update this compendium on a quarterly basis.</p>
<h2><a id="sectionI" name="sectionI">SECTION I: Medicaid Technical Assistance on System Structure and Financing</a></h2>
<h3><a id="sectionI.1" name="sectionI.1">PRIMER FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The Primer for the Medicaid Program describes the many options states have to use the Medicaid program to fund long-term care services and supports; and is designed to encourage use of the Medicaid program in a manner that minimizes reliance on institutions and maximizes community integration in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>The Primer spans the full range of Medicaid choices. It addresses program modifications states can implement as a state plan option (without special waiver of Federal law), as well as those for which Federal waiver approval must be obtained. In addition to comprehensive explanations of program features states can implement to achieve these goals, the Primer presents examples of state programs that have taken advantage of Medicaids flexibility to expand home and community-based services (HCBS) for people of all ages with disabilities. Designed to serve as a reference guide, it is written in easily understood language, but with sufficient annotation of source material to fulfill its technical support role. Some issues remain unresolved, because particular provisions of Medicaid regulations and state interpretations thereof are being challenged in the courts. Major unresolved issues are discussed where relevant.</p>
<p>Its intended audience is policymakers and others who wish to understand how Medicaid can be used -- and is being used -- to expand access to a broad range of home and community-based services and supports, and to promote consumer choice and control. The Primer is written with the notion that it is up to state policymakers working with the disability and aging communities to identify the unique needs and goals of the state, and then use the Primer (a) to choose the options best suited to a particular state and (b) to decide how the options chosen can be best used in that state. The design of the Primer results from a series of discussions among Federal officials, state policymakers, service providers, and advocates on maximizing the documents utility.</p>

<h3><a id="sectionI.2" name="sectionI.2">STATE MEDICAID LETTERS ISSUED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<h3>Implementing Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>As of July 2001, CMS has issued five State Medicaid letters designed to provide guidance and support to states in their efforts to enable persons with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. State Medicaid letters are a mechanism which CMS uses to communicate administrative decisions on Medicaid statute and regulations on key programmatic issues.</p>
<p>The first Olmstead letter provides states with background information on the ADA and the implications of the Supreme Courts decision in <strong><em>Olmstead v. L.C.</em></strong> on the interpretation of the ADA as it applies to publicly-funded programs for persons with disabilities. The second state Medicaid letter provides a series of commonly asked questions and answers regarding state implementation of the Olmstead decision. It provides additional guidance on how states might develop comprehensive, effectively working plans, definitions of disability and populations covered by the ADA, and more information on how states can obtain assistance from the Department on ADA and Olmstead issues. In the third state Medicaid letter, CMS reports on the results of an internal review of federal Medicaid policies and regulations related to home and community-based services, and makes a number of policy changes and clarifications to facilitate state efforts to provide services and supports to persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting. The fourth state Medicaid letter provides clarification on a number of additional questions related to state discretion in the design and operation of 1915(c) waiver programs. The fifth state Medicaid letter announces the availability of some new tools that states can use in their efforts to expand access to long term supports and services for persons with disabilities.</p>
<h3>Contact Information:</h3>
<p>Complete versions of the five state Medicaid letters are posted on the CMS ADA/Olmstead website at: <a href="http://www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/olmstead/olmshome.htm">http://www.hcfa.gov/medicaid/olmstead/olmshome.htm</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="sectionI.3" name="sectionI.3">PROMISING PRACTICES IN HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is creating a repository of Promising Practices in Home and Community Based Services to assist states, in partnership with their disability and aging communities, to strengthen their community long term support systems. These reform efforts are designed to enable persons of any age who have a disability or long term illness to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Live in the most integrated community setting appropriate to their individual support requirements and preferences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise meaningful choices about their living environment, their service providers, the types of supports they receive, and the manner in which supportive services are provided; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain quality services in a manner consistent with their living preferences and priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Effective models of long term support abound and new innovations are being designed and implemented by state and local programs continuously. Yet information about these efforts is not widespread and the practical knowledge needed to make significant improvements in long term support systems often goes unshared among states. The purpose of the Promising Practices Reports is to disseminate timely information on program and policy innovations so that all states and stakeholders may benefit from the experiences of their peers across the country. The Promising Practices Reports are being developed by The MEDSTAT Group under contract with the Disabled and Elderly Health Program Group within CMS.</p>
<p>Some states are undertaking comprehensive reform of their entire system of home and community based services. Others are identifying specific components as targets for incremental improvement. Thus, some reports will focus on "whole systems". More frequently, the Promising Practices Reports will focus on discrete components of home and community-based service systems, such as person centered planning, eligibility systems, personal assistance services, financing mechanisms, quality improvement systems, and case management systems, that can be incorporated into an overall program design.</p>
<p>Innovations are undertaken within the context of a state's unique characteristics, history and environment. States and communities seek accurate, timely information to consider whether the adoption of a specific practice would be a good fit within their existing policies and programs, and if so, what types of modifications would be needed to achieve replication.</p>
<p>Finally, promising practices can be found in a wide range of home and community based services programs targeted toward diverse populations. A program's funding source does not necessarily limit its broader applicability. In fact, any one specific program is often supported by a combination of funding streams such as the Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waiver program, regular Medicaid state plan options, programs funded by other federal agencies, and state and local resources.</p>
<p>Each report contains the following key elements:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Introduction: describes the challenge the promising practice was designed to address and its intended benefit to people who need long term supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background: provides contextual information on the home and community-based services system in which the practice was implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intervention: describes the practice and how it operates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation: Outlines how the practice was put in place and, where possible, costs associated with its adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact: summarizes evidence of the practice's effectiveness in achieving its objective, the people it benefits and its ongoing cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact Information-lists the name, phone number and email address of a person to contact for more information and a related web site link.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In sum, the Promising Practices Reports are intended to stimulate HCBS program changes, spark creative ideas, and serve as a launching pad for the next generation of program innovations. Promising Practices Reports do not, however, represent an endorsement of any practice by CMS or by MEDSTAT. Rather, they are a starting point for fostering a dynamic examination of ways to improve community support systems for persons of all ages with disabilities.</p>
<p>By design, most reports succinctly describe promising practices in two to three pages. Additional Promising Practices Reports are continuously being developed and will be posted on the website periodically. Case studies that provide more in-depth information about selected practices will be included at a later time as well.</p>
<p>CMS and MEDSTAT always welcome new ideas for additional Promising Practices Reports. If you are implementing a Promising Practice or know of one you think would be of interest to other states or communities, please send your suggestion to CMS at <a href="mailto:promisingpractices@cms.hhs.gov">promisingpractices@cms.hhs.gov</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="sectionI.4" name="sectionI.4">NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY LIVING: A SYSTEMS CHANGE CONFERENCE</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The first annual Systems Change conference was held in Washington, DC on May 24-25, 2001, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and facilitated by the HCBS Resource Network. The conference was targeted toward States, consumers, providers and advocates to share information and ideas on home and community based systems change initiatives. These initiatives will enable more integrated, community living for persons with disabilities of all ages. The conference also provided a national forum to present various major grant initiatives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The overall objective of the conference was to help States improve their long term support systems. Information was exchanged among stakeholders, meritorious practices shared, and profiles of complementary Federal programs presented. The webcast highlights two distinct tracks from the conference, Choice and Responsibility, and Whole Person Support Systems, as well as offering the plenary sessions.</p>
<h3><a id="sectionI.5" name="sectionI.5">2010 EXPRESS: A 10-YEAR ACTION PLAN TO ACHIEVE COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICE SYSTEMS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND THEIR FAMILIES</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Division of Services for Children with Special Health Needs</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Families and professionals alike continue to be frustrated by the fragmentation of services for children with special health care needs. We know that all children and youth with special health care needs and their families require the same basic opportunities -- comprehensive system of services and supports that allows them to live at home, go to school, play, and build relationships in their own communities. The present fragmentation of services is unnecessary, expensive, inefficient, and a barrier to true family-centered care.</p>
<p>As one step in addressing this problem, a new definition of children with special health care needs has been developed and is now widely accepted. Children with special health care needs are those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. This definition is purposely broad and inclusive. It encompasses children and youth who not only require health and health-related services, but who may also have other needs, including early intervention services, special education and related services, vocational education, mental health and substance abuse services, and social services. Moreover, their families may require family support and other services, such as transportation, respite care, and employment as they raise their children in this nations homes and communities.</p>
<p>The 2010 Express is a comprehensive 10-year plan for the nation to meet six goals for children and youth with special health care needs, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families of children with special health care needs will partner in decision making and will be satisfied with the services they receive;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children with special health care needs will receive coordinated ongoing comprehensive care within a medical home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families of children with special health care needs will have adequate private and/or public insurance to pay for the services they need;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children will be screened early and continuously for special health care needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community-based service systems will be organized so families can use them easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youth with special health care needs will receive the services necessary to make transitions to adult life, including adult health care, work, and independence.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Technical assistance is available for state and local implementation of each goal.</p>

<h3><a id="sectionII.2" name="sectionII.2">NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Administration on Aging</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) was modeled in large part after successful LTC programs in States such as California, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and after listening to the needs expressed by hundreds of family caregivers in discussions held across the country. Funded at $125 million in fiscal year 2001, approximately $113 million has been allocated to states through a congressionally mandated formula that is based on a proportionate share of the 70+ population. The program calls for all states, working in partnership with area agencies on aging and local community-service providers to have five basic services for family caregivers, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Information to caregivers about available services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistance to caregivers in gaining access to supportive services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual counseling, organization of support groups, and caregiver training to caregivers to assist the caregivers in making decisions and solving problems relating to their caregiving roles;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respite care to enable caregivers to be temporarily relieved from their caregiving responsibilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplemental services, on a limited basis, to complement the care provided by caregivers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In January 2001, AoA issued guidance to states on the implementation of the new program, and on February 15, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson announced the release of those funds to states. AoA is planning a technical assistance conference for the Fall. The conference will highlight innovative and successful state caregiver support initiatives that might warrant replication.</p>
<p>The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000 also establishes the Native American Caregiver Support Program, with $5 million of the $125 million designated to assist caregivers of Native American elders who are chronically ill or have disabilities. In addition, $6 million of the $125 million will be used to fund competitive innovative grants, grants of national significance, conferences and training, to further develop comprehensive and effective systems of support in family caregiving.</p>

</ul><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The National Consortium for Health Systems Development (NCHSD) represents states that have joined together to assist other state agencies, legislatures, consumers and advocates in their efforts to build systems that support competitive employment for individuals with disabilities. The primary means for achieving this goal is through state-to-state information sharing, individualized technical assistance, and the dissemination of best practices to a broad array of involved stakeholders in states around the country. The NCHSD is an effecient venue to facilitate state-to-state information sharing about best practices and challenges encountered in building supportive health care and social support systems for people with disabilities who wish to work. Many of the state partners in NCHSD are among the first group of states in the country to implement work incentive options in their Medicaid programs. Additionally, they have been in the forefront of building inter-agency partnerships for the purpose of creating integrated and comprehensive approaches to workforce policy development for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>NCHSD operates on the premise that the best policy happens when all stakeholders are at the table and actively involved in setting the policy agenda. By providing opportunities for meaningful collaboration between states, advocates and consumers, in partnership with federal and other key stakeholders, NCHSD activities can create the conditions that foster the relationships necessary to build comprehensive, consumer-driven health systems development.</p>

<h2><a id="sectionIV" name="sectionIV">SECTION IV: Performance Management and Quality in Community Settings</a></h2>
<h3><a id="sectionIV.1" name="sectionIV.1">WAIVER QUALITY INITIATIVES</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>To improve the quality of programs administered under the Home and Community- Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Program. Three waiver quality assurance/improvement projects are under implementation by The MEDSTAT Group: (1) Development of a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Regional Office HCBS Waiver Monitoring Guide (The Protocol); (2) Development and Testing of Performance Measures for HCBS Waiver Programs; and (3) State Readiness to Use Data in Assessing HCBS Waiver Programs. Below, each project is described in more detail.</p>
<h4>Development of a CMS Regional Office HCBS Waiver Monitoring Guide(The Protocol)</h4>
<p>During CY 2000 MEDSTAT developed a monitoring protocol for CMS Regional Office (RO) staff to use in their periodic reviews of the quality of the HCBS waiver programs. This protocol was developed primarily for RO staff -- to encourage consistency in and comprehensiveness of reviews. However, it was also developed with State use in mind in that it operationalizes the relatively non-specific assurances that States must provide to the Federal Government as a condition of waiver approval. In other words, it specifies what the States must do in order to comply with the assurances, and what evidence the RO will be looking for as verification that the assurances have been met. The Protocol also includes sections devoted to Quality Enhancing activities that the States may seek to implement in their quest for quality improvement (dubbed Recommended But Not Required).</p>
<p>The development of The Protocol was a collaborative endeavor. Feedback on over 50 iterations was provided by a State-Federal Work Group (that included representatives from the advocacy community), two CMS Regional Office Work Groups -- one focused on process and the other on content issues, as well as CMS Central Office staff. CMS also instituted a public comment period during last July and August, and based on comments received, certain sections of The Protocol were revised. CMS sees The Protocol as a living document, and expects the content to evolve over time. That the Protocol is now in its third official version -- Version 1.2 -- is evidence that this expectation is being borne out.</p>
<p>The Protocol went into effect on January 1, 2001. All reviews conducted by RO staff after this date must be performed using The Protocol. In July 2000 States and CMS RO staff were invited to a one-day session where The Protocol was showcased. CMSs Central Office has also provided additional training opportunities for CMS RO staff conducting waiver reviews. In an effort to insure that The Protocol is implemented as intended, CMS has assigned one of its RO waiver review staff, who is experienced both in waiver reviews and quality assurance, to accompany other RO staff on their initial reviews using The Protocol. CMS is also currently developing a format for waiver review reports that will be consistent with The Protocols format; adherence to this review format will be required and is viewed as yet another mechanism for insuring consistency and comprehensiveness of reviews. To date, at least five waiver reviews have been conducted using The Protocol. For all practical purposes, MEDSTATs work on The Protocol has been completed.</p>
<h4>Development and Testing of Performance Measures for HCBS Waiver Programs</h4>
<p>This project requires MEDSTAT to develop and test one or more performance measures that States may use (at their discretion) in monitoring the quality of their waiver programs. Work on this project began in the Winter of 2000. The projects State-Federal Work Group (same Work Group that provided guidance on the development of The Protocol) was assigned the task of recommending the focus of the performance measures. This group strongly suggested a Consumer Experience measure that has evolved into a Consumer Experience Survey. Through a focus-group approach, this Work Group identified five priority areas, or domains, that the survey should address:</p>
<ul><li>Choice/Empowerment;</li>
<li>Satisfaction with Services;</li>
<li>Access to Care;</li>
<li>Respect/Dignity; and</li>
<li>Community Integration/Inclusion.</li>
</ul><p>Initially, the Work Group recommended that one instrument be developed that would be appropriate for telephone administration, applicable to all HCBS waiver populations, and take no longer than 10 minutes to administer. Given these recommendations, it became clear that besides being relevant to the quality of care and services provided under the auspices of the waiver, the questions had to use language that would be as universal as possible and response patterns limited so as to maximize comprehension and ability of the interviewee to respond meaningfully. Additional feedback sessions were held with the Work Group during the summer and fall of 2000 -- to flesh out the questions to be asked, their wording and response patterns.</p>
<p>During December 2000 and January 2001, MEDSTAT conducted cognitive testing with waiver participants in two States. Cognitive testing took the form of a series of follow-up questions following each survey item intended to elicit responses that would indicate whether the respondent understood the intent of the question and response alternatives. Based on these face-to-face interviews, MEDSTAT concluded that the appropriateness of the survey items varied by waiver population, as well as by the type of services provided under the auspices of the waiver. MEDSTAT recommended that the survey be more tailored to the needs and experiences of the different populations. MEDSTAT also identified item wording/responses that required more refinement and simplification.</p>
<p>Following the findings of these initial pretests, the instrument was adapted to a modular approach so that it was more relevant to the waiver experiences of different types of persons with disability. In addition, MEDSTAT developed a companion instrument for proxy respondents. These new instruments -- one for the frail elderly and non-elderly physically disabled, one for the MR/DD population, and an MR/DD proxy -- were tested in three States during Spring 2001. A third round of cognitive testing, using a phone administration mode, will follow. In addition, MEDSTAT is planning additional testing in order to estimate administration time for the various waiver populations and surrogates. These testing phases should be accomplished by Summer 2001.</p>
<p>Under a new contract with CMS, MEDSTAT will conduct additional psychometric testing of the Consumer Experience Survey, to evaluate reliability and validity. These tests will include inter-rater reliability testing, and a field test in one or more States. Information from the field test will be use to review frequencies of survey items, and to assess how discriminate response categories are. Also, field testing experience will be reflected in the guidance prepared for states. This additional testing is scheduled for Fall 2001 and Winter 2002.</p>
<p>The final stage of the project entails the development of a users guide and related technical assistance materials that will provide guidance to the States in fielding the survey, interpreting results, and using the results within the context of a quality improvement strategy.</p>
<h4>State Readiness to Use Data in Assessing HCBS Waiver Programs</h4>
<p>The State Data Readiness initiative focuses on identifying exemplary quality improvement practices for HCBS waiver programs built around the collection of data or other information. For this initiative, MEDSTAT is in the process of identifying specific examples of the types of HCBS quality improvement activities that States are conducting (or plan to conduct), with an emphasis on the types of data and other information that is used to manage the development, implementation and monitoring of these activities. Examples of such activities could include, among others, the use of performance measures, outcomes data, systems for reporting and tracking complaints or special incidents, and surveys or focus groups to obtain waiver participant input on quality. Over the past few months, MEDSTAT has been identifying States that may be managing these activities through interviews with CMS RO representatives, website solicitations, and letters to state units on aging. MEDSTAT is currently in the process of speaking with a number of states (PA, TX, SC, MI, OR, AZ, FL, NC) about a variety of their activities. Once examples have been identified, in-depth case studies will be conducted of selected programs in order to understand how these activities have been developed and how they are managed on a day-to-day basis. It is expected that the case studies will be completed in CY 2001. Case study results will be shared broadly to assist other States in developing or implementing similar activities. The contract also calls for a series of technical assistance activities, to be determined, that would assist States in developing and using data to monitor and improve the quality of their waiver programs. Technical assistance activities are likely to occur in late CY 2001 and the first half of 2002.</p>

</ul><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The purpose of the project is to identify and promote promising practices in Person-Centered Planning and Quality Assurance within home and community-based service systems for persons with developmental disabilities. There are three components to the project. The first component is two Consensus Conferences on Person Centered Planning. The purpose of the first conference was to arrive at a definition of Person Centered Services, i.e. how you would know person centered services if you saw them. The second conference, to be held in August 2001, will provide examples of how Person Centered Planning is being implemented at the systems level. The Consensus Conferences are being organized by NASDDDS. The second component of the grant is a series of case studies of states which employ the principle of Person Centered Planning. The third component of the project is the Quality Mall. The Quality Mall is a comprehensive, one-stop shopping center for the transfer of information about person-centered services and quality promotion practices. The quality mall is constructed on the concept of a shopping mall, which is structured around a number of shops which are stocked with goods or, in this case, information. Each shop has a designated shop manager, who has the responsibility for keeping his or her respective shop filled with quality information. While the intention is to provide information that can be read by persons with developmental disabilities, the primary target audience is people in the service system at the state, local, or provider levels.</p>
<p>The grant began in July 1999 and will run through June 2002. It is funded at approximately $670,000 for the 3-year period.</p>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>"Living Well With A Disability" is a health promotion curriculum delivered in consumer-controlled ILCs to address secondary conditions associated with existing disabilities. The curriculum is a theory-based, 10-week modular health promotion and behavior-modifying intervention, copyrighted by researchers at the University of Montana's Rural Institute on Disabilities. The curriculum is implemented nationally in conjunction with collaborators at the University of Kansas and constituents throughout the country at Independent Living Centers (ILCs). Participants in the <em>Living Well</em> curriculum engage in therapeutic interventions delivered by trained peer educators at ILCs. The curriculum is divided into modules focusing on goal-setting, information-seeking, and problem-solving strategies, and developing healthy reactions to frustration and stress, overcoming depression, engaging in and maintaining exercise habits, and enhancing nutritional intake. Study results have demonstrated that this programmatic health promotion intervention is beneficial, cost-saving, and potentially cost-effective. The next steps include extending that demonstration into managed care, Medicaid, and privately insured payment environments.</p>
<p>Using an instrument called, Life Quality and Health For Adults with Developmental Disabilities: A Secondary Conditions, Risk and Protective Factors Surveillance Instrument, the investigators measured the prevalence of an array of secondary conditions commonly affecting people with disabilities. After participating in the <em>Living Well</em> curriculum, post-test results indicated a 37 percent overall reduction in the prevalence of reported secondary conditions among participants, and a reduction in the number of physician visits by 45 percent during the six months following the intervention. Additional results from a longitudinal cost-effectiveness analysis of the curriculum indicated that savings in direct medical expenditures among <em>Living Well</em> participants who are the most frequent utilizers of medical care services would offset the cost of the intervention within two months, and that expenditures among average utilizers would be recouped within six months.

<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Disease Control, National Center on Birth Defects and Development Disabilities</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The CDC currently funds five projects aimed at developing environmental checklists and measuring community accessibility. These assessment tools will be useful in helping communities become accessible to residents with disabilities.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Investigators at Washington University and the Paraquad Independent Living Center are developing a set of objective, reliable, and valid measures of the physical, social and cultural environments that are relevant to the community participation of people with disabilities, particularly those with mobility limitations. The measures developed will provide a Community Health Environment Checklist (CHEC) to be used by people with disabilities, health professionals, employers, recreational site planners, telecommunication operators, transportation providers and commercial establishment owners to assess the barriers and facilitators to participation and reduce community inaccessibility, a risk factor for poor health and well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigators at the University of Washington are developing and testing measurement instruments that identify and assess important community factors that affect accessibility for people with disabilities. The investigators are (a) identifying important aspects of community environments, (b) selecting and designing measures of physical and social access, and (c) collecting environmental and individual data from neighborhoods in two cities, Seattle and Spokane, in partnership with their local health districts. This community research assumes the importance of meaningful participation by people with disabilities and the need for measures that can point to realistic interventions that increase access and participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigators at Craig Hospital recently developed and validated the Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors (CHIEF), a survey instrument to assess the frequency and magnitude of perceived physical, attitudinal, and policy barriers that keep people with disabilities from doing what they want or need to do. This instrument demonstrated that people with disabilities encounter frequent and problematic environmental barriers. Moreover, the CHIEF has demonstrated that the impact of barriers is associated with the type and severity of the disability. In ongoing studies, the investigators are developing three new instruments: (a) a community characteristics checklist of physical/structural aspects of the environment reported by key informants, (b) a general population survey of attitudes toward disability expressed by community members, and (c) a service use and outcomes discrepancy analysis comparing service utilization and outcome achievement data between people with and without disability in a community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigators from university of North Carolina, Gallaudet University and the Center for Discovery in New York are developing reliable, valid, and generalizable measurement instruments to assess environmental factors affecting children and youth with disabilities in their communities. The conceptual and taxonomic framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - ICF (World Health Organization, 2000) serves as the basis for defining and documenting environmental factors affecting functioning and secondary conditions of children and youth with disabilities. The study will yield a set of psychometrically sound and efficient measures of the environment that will be disseminated widely for use in public health surveillance, community intervention and evaluation efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigators at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in coordination with the existing network of Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs), are developing two standardized instruments to measure the accessibility of community-based recreation and fitness facilities, including parks, pools, trails, fitness centers, community recreation centers, etc. by people with mobility impairments, <em>caregivers</em> professional staff. This project, AIMFREE, will assist facilitate community integration [<a href="http://www.aimfree.org]">http://www.aimfree.org]</a></p>

<li>Institute for the Future of Aging Services</li>
</ul><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to heighten the awareness among federal, state, and local policymakers, long-term care providers, consumers, and foundations about issues related to the frontline long-term care paraprofessional workforce, including people who work for nursing homes, home care agencies and non-medical residential facilities and people who work as independent providers.</p>
<p>There is currently a major shortage of these workers, which is certain to grow as the demand for long-term care increases with the aging of the population. There are at least four major issues. First, paraprofessional workers receive very low wages and receive few benefits, making these jobs not competitive with other positions. Second, many of the basic requirements of the jobs are unattractive, involving caring for clients who deteriorate and die, cleaning up after incontinent consumers, and lifting bed-bound persons with disabilities. Third, there is no career ladder and little chance of advancement. And, finally, workers are often taken for granted and not involved in organizational decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The project will: identify successful training, recruitment, and retention models for frontline workers; identify training needs; analyze policy options; identify data gaps; and develop a research and demonstration strategy that the government and foundations can undertake to improve policymaking. A major focus will be on developing strategies that local communities can use. An outline of the planned activities follows.</p>

<h3><a id="sectionVIII.4" name="sectionVIII.4">NATIONAL AND STATE COALITIONS AT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<h4>National and State Coalitions to Promote Community-Based Care for Persons with Mental Illness</h4>
<p>This initiative addresses barriers and recommendations at the national and state levels in support of integrated services for persons with mental illness. The primary objective is to assist states in developing and enhancing state coalitions addressing the Olmstead decision. The National Coalitions role is to help establish guidelines and recommendations, identify models, best practices and technical assistance resources, and help disseminate information on Olmstead implementation and effective community integration plans.</p>
<p>The National Coalition was implemented in December 2000 with a Kick-Off Meeting representing more than 60 members including a wide cross-section of Federal agencies, national advocacy groups, consumer organizations, and professional associations.</p>
<h4>State Olmstead Coalitions</h4>
<p>A Financial Assistance Application ($20,000 per jurisdiction) to support State coalitions was sent out in March 2001. As of June 2001, 43 States are funded, one application is pending, one is in uncertain status, four are expected to submit applications and four declined to apply. Of the funded States, 88 percent support existing coalitions and 12 percent are starting new coalitions. All States identified a staff person to serve as the Olmstead Coordinator. These Coordinators will be invited to a three-day technical assistance meeting scheduled for September 24-26, 2001 in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h4>Other National and State Coalition Activities</h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Developed train the trainer curriculum by consumers for consumers to assist in becoming informed and active participants in Olmstead planning and implementation. The document will be offered to States as part of technical assistance support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing training materials for State Olmstead Coordinators including preparing consumers for facility discharge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developed a document, with input from the National Coalition, on the barriers faced by persons with mental illness as they transition to the community. A special report on the barriers faced by children is being prepared.</p>

<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>As part of the FY 2001 DHHS budget, Congress specifically appropriated $70 million for Systems Change for Community Living grants that will assist states and others, in partnership with their disability and aging communities, to design and implement effective and enduring improvements in community long term support systems. These systemic changes will be designed to enable children and adults of any age who have a disability or long-term illness to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Live in the most integrated community setting appropriate to their individual support requirements and their preferences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise meaningful choices about their living environment, the providers of services they receive, the types of supports they use and the manner by which services are provided; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain quality services in a manner as consistent as possible with their community living preferences and priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These system change grants represent a major new initiative to promote the design and delivery of home and community-based services that support people with a disability or long-term illness to live and participate in their communities. Medicaid home and community-bases services play an increasingly critical role in enabling individuals of all ages who have a significant disability or long-term illness to live fuller, more self- directed lives in their own homes and communities than ever before. Despite continuing progress on this front, however, States wishing to improve the availability and quality of these services still face significant challenges. Accordingly, Congress and the Administration have envisioned a new grant program to assist States and the disability and aging communities to work together to find viable ways to expand such services and supports. The new grant funds are meant to be used to bring about enduring system improvements in providing long-term services and supports, including attendant care to individuals in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs.</p>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<h4>Beyond Olmstead: Making Community Based Services Work for All Persons with Disabilities</h4>
<p>On July 11-13, 2001 ULP conducted a workshop to provide State and local policymakers with tools to improve their ability to work collaboratively with consumers, providers, advocates and others on accurately assessing consumer needs and planning for successful transitions from institutions, or alternatively, increasing the types and level of support for persons already living in the community. The workshop included sessions on:</p>
<ul><li>consumer centered planning and budgeting;</li>
<li>planning community based delivery systems;</li>
<li>strategies to ensure successful transitions from institutions to communities;</li>
<li>linking system design, budgeting and consumer preferences;</li>
<li>consumer directed care;</li>
<li>integrating supportive services with primary and specialty care; and</li>
<li>expanding Medicaid eligibility to promote entering the workplace.</li>
</ul><h4>State Long Term Care Programs: Balancing Cost, Quality and Access</h4>
<p>On May 6-8, 2002 ULP will co-sponsor a workshop with the National Governors Association to provide senior State executive branch officials with information that will help them develop policies and programs that provide choices for low income Medicaid beneficiaries who need long term care services, while addressing concerns about cost, quality and access. The workshop will include a session on workforce challenges facing policymakers and providers and the findings from a review of State efforts to strengthen the paraprofessional workforce. There will also be a session discussing the Administrations community integration initiative and how States can use waiver authority to demonstrate new ideas in the organization and delivery of care.</p>
<h3><a id="sectionVIII.7" name="sectionVIII.7">RESEARCH SUPPLEMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>National Institutes of Health</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its awarding components have developed an initiative that is designed to address the low participation rate for Americans with disabilities in the science and engineering research work force. This initiative extends opportunities to individuals with qualifying disabilities [ e.g. total deafness in both ears, visual acuity less than 20/200 with corrective lenses, speech impairment, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, convulsive disorders, mental or emotional illness, learning disabilities, kidney dialysis, and severe distortions of limbs and or spine] who are capable of entering or resuming research careers. Under this initiative the NIH will offer supplemental awards to certain ongoing research grants to encourage individuals to pursue biomedical, behavioral, clinical or social science research careers. It is hoped that the availability of support will substantially increase the number of individuals with disabilities in the health-related sciences. Principal investigators holding certain NIH research grants are eligible to obtain administrative supplements to existing grants for the support and recruitment of scientists and students with disabilities into research careers. In addition, this program will provide support to accommodate the disabilities of established investigators who become disabled.</p>

<h3><a id="sectionVIII.13" name="sectionVIII.13">NATIONAL GAINS CENTER FOR PEOPLE WITH CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS IN CONTACT WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Since 1995, the National GAINS Center has functioned as the locus for the collection and dissemination of information on effective services for people with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders in contact with the justice system. During its first years, the GAINS Center focused on helping the integration of local level treatment and criminal justice systems to improve service delivery for people with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. In particular, the GAINS Center achieved this through on-site technical assistance and sponsoring of Regional Forums. As the technical assistance center for the SAMHSA Jail Diversion Knowledge Development Application study, the GAINS Center helped many of the sites to develop their programs and promote their effective features. Over the years, the GAINS Center has accumulated vast knowledge of best practices programs and research to share with the field. One of the main outcomes from the first phase of the GAINS Center is the heightened awareness of and attention to the special needs of the co-occurring disorder population.</p>
<p>The role of the GAINS Center in its second phase is notably different in effecting change than it was during its first years. Instead of leading the field toward consensus on the importance of recognizing co-occurring disorders and the need for integrated treatment, the GAINS Center now finds itself partnering with national advocacy groups, professional membership associations and disciplinary associations to apply its accumulating knowledge base. The Center has been focused on aggressively compiling databases tracking jail diversion programs, mental health courts and other treatment programs throughout the USA. Through this, the Center has maximized its ability to provide essential information to national associations (e.g. Council of State Governments) engaged in processes for defining future policy directions for the field and to review and recommend model programs and promising practices. In addition, GAINS has continued its efforts at the local practice level, through the provision of technical assistance and sponsorship of Regional Forums.</p>

</ul><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>This is a five-year program of research, training, technical assistance, and dissemination activities designed to promote self-determination for people with psychiatric disability.

Center projects are comprised of five core areas: choice in treatment decision-making; economic self-sufficiency; consumer advocacy under managed care; career development through real jobs for real wages; and strengthening self-determination skills and self-advocacy. Project activities are implemented by multidisciplinary workgroups comprised of consumers, families, service providers, state agency administrators, nationally renowned researchers, and Center staff. Advanced technology is incorporated into each project's objectives and Center training and dissemination activities. The Center also provides training on psychiatric disability, research design and methodology, rehabilitation and recovery models, and consumer and family outcomes. Individualized technical assistance and training seminars are supplemented with instructional curricula, manuals, and software. Activities target rehabilitation and mental health professionals, consumers, families, psychiatrists/physicians, social workers, employers, co-workers, and educators.</p>

<li>Department of Veterans Affairs</li>
<li>Health Resource Services Administration's Bureau of Primary Care</li>
<li>Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services</li>
</ul><h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Many older individuals experience serious mental health and substance abuse (MH/SA) problems that affect their quality of life as well as their ability to function independently in the community. Although prevalence rates vary in epidemiological studies among the elderly, it is clear that elderly individuals experience high rates of depression and anxiety disorders, as well as alcohol abuse and dependence. With the projected increase in the number of older Americans in the years to come, it is evident that both the clinical and policy communities need to be well-informed as to the nature and effectiveness of different service delivery models for treating mental health and substance abuse problems.</p>
<p>The study will identify differences in clinical and cost outcomes between models referring consumers to specialty mental health/substance abuse services outside the primary care setting and those providing such services within the primary care setting itself. The 4-year study plans to randomize close to 3,000 patients with MH/SA problems to either integrated or referral models of MH/SA care, with over 2,000 persons enrolled as of June 2001. Participants are assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months to determine changes in clinical symptoms and functioning over the course of treatment. Patients are being enrolled from 11 sites, which represent roughly 50 clinical settings and include a variety of providers from managed care environments, community health clinics, VA facilities, and group practice settings. The study sites represent a rich diversity of ethnic/minority and rural/urban populations.</p>
<p>Harvard Medical School, Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, and John Snow, Inc. have joined together to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC) for this multi-site study. The Coordinating Center's role is multifaceted, providing leadership, administrative support, and technical expertise in the development and implementation of the multi-site protocol. The Coordinating Center is also taking the lead in designing and implementing the cost study portion of the study. In addition, the CC is responsible for collecting and analyzing clinical outcome and cost data, as well as descriptive data on the integrated and referral models of care.</p>

<p>The Action Center seeks to help <em>Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS)</em> grantees fully attain their goals of interagency collaboration and adoption of evidence-based practices to reduce school violence and substance abuse and to promote healthy development and resilience among their children and youth. More than a generation of research provides a solid foundation of information pertaining to the multifaceted issues of school violence prevention and the enhancement of healthy development and resilience. Yet, the translation of scientific knowledge into everyday practice requires customized, ongoing, and accessible technical assistance. The SS/HS Action Center connects communities, local educational agencies and individual families with valuable resources and materials enabling them to promote collaborative efforts in enhancing resilience and preventing school violence.</p>
<p>The Action Center's technical assistance (TA) model includes (1) a national network of consultant/brokers who are assigned a specific number of grantees for the duration of the grants, (2) a consortium of subject experts who possess a broad range of knowledge that spans the programmatic goals of all grantees, and (3) an Internet web-based clearinghouse: <em>Practices and Resources Clearinghouse (PARC)</em>. Community Liaisons staff will process information and referral requests from the PARC and provide limited TA to SS/HS unfunded applicants who seek to maintain collaborative partnerships.</p>

<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The Women, Violence, and Co-Occurring Disorders study addresses the psychological and emotional impacts of physical and/or sexual abuse in women who also have co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. This study has been designed to address the following constituent issues that have been raised in the course of knowledge synthesis and planning: (1) the use of consumers as "experts" on defining needed services and their evaluation, and in all other phases of planning and implementation for this study; (2) methods of reducing the use of seclusion and restraint of these women in all human service program settings, not just in hospitals and jails; (3) humane and effective methods of intervention for cases of self-injury exhibited by these women in the course of treatment; and (4) further defining and expanding implementation of "trauma informed" services in the target organizations and in other human services organizations.</p>
<p>Funded in 1998 and set to conclude in 2003, this study addresses the psychological and emotional impacts of physical and/or sexual abuse in women who also have co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. The study, with 9 sites plus a Coordinating Center that encompasses both data analysis and technical assistance responsibilities, has begun to delineate and examine community-based strategies to integrate the formerly separate treatment interventions for this target population. The study is also in the process of developing new knowledge regarding the feasibility and efficacy of combining trauma-specific intervention strategies with other services for women in an integrated intervention. There is also a children's sub-study comprised of 4 participating sites where the same combined services approach is being tailored to and tested on the children of the mothers in the study.</p>

<p>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Mental Health Services</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Community Action Grants support communities seeking to adopt exemplary practices into their systems of care for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbances. Grants fund community activities designed to build consensus around the adoption and implementation of an exemplary practice. Exemplary practices are determined by strict criteria that require the grantees to demonstrate that the proposed intervention has produced positive client-level outcomes in community or clinical settings.</p>
<p>The program incorporates two phases of support. <em>Phase I Grants</em> provide up to $150,000 to support the consensus building process among key stakeholders in a community or state to adopt an evidenced-based exemplary practice. <em>Phase II Grants</em> provide a second year of funding (up to $150,000) to support the implementation of the exemplary practice into the systems of care for the target population.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1997, the Community Action Grant Program has supported over 130 Phase I and II grant activities as diverse as the adoption of effective approaches to case management, supported employment and education programs, education and empowerment of consumers and their families, prevention of inappropriate incarceration, integrated mental health/substance abuse treatment, outreach to homeless adults with mental illness. and prevention practices for racial and ethnic minorities. The Community Action Grant program has been the catalyst for the development of community partnerships and lasting systems change in a number of communities, cities, and states around the nation.</p>

<h3><a id="sectionVIII.20" name="sectionVIII.20">CDC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH ESTABLISHING STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT DISABILITY AND HEALTH PROGRAMS</a></h3>
<h3>Funding Organization:</h3>
<p>Centers for Disease Control, National Center on Birth Defects and Development Disabilities</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>The CDC provides technical assistance and funding to establish Disability and Health Programs within state departments of health.</p>
<p>In FY 2002 funds were made available to states for implementing projects to prevent secondary conditions and promote the health of people with disabilities. CDC currently funds 16 states under program announcement 02007 -- Washington, South Carolina, New York, North Carolina, New Mexico, Iowa, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oregon, California, Vermont, Montana, Illinois, Virginia, New Jersey. Level I projects focus on implementing health promotion programs targeting people with disabilities in the community. Level II projects focus on developing a state health plan that includes people with disabilities and planning health promotion interventions. Level III projects focus on developing state health department infrastructure and program planning to support a disability and health program. For example, North Carolina develops guidelines to removing barriers in the community such as those found in health clubs and fitness facilities, as well as health care facilities. The North Carolina guidelines will provide technical assistance to communities and residents with disabilities across the United States.</p>
