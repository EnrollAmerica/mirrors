</tr></table><p><b>NEW INFORMATION WILL HELP HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ADOPT  		HEALTH IT</b></p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) released a report  		today acknowledging that while health information technology has been shown to  		improve quality of care for patients, most health care providers need more  		information about how to implement these technologies successfully. AHRQ is  		helping to fill this gap with findings from more than 100 projects across the  		country. These projects make up AHRQ's $166 million health IT initiative. </p>
<p> The report, <i>Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology</i>,  		is a synthesis of studies that have examined the quality impact of health IT as  		well as the costs and organizational changes needed to implement health IT  		systems. This report reviews scientific data about the implementation of health  		IT to date, as documented in studies published through 2003. It does not  		project future health care benefits or savings, in contrast to other reports.  		</p>
<p>The authors conclude that scientific reviews have shown significant  		improvements in the quality of health care utilizing health IT systems.  		However, these successes have occurred primarily within large health care  		systems that created their own health IT systems and devoted substantial  		commitment and resources to these efforts. AHRQ's initiative is developing data  		needed about how to put health IT to work in more common health care settings  		such as physicians' offices and hospitals. </p>
<p>"HIT has the potential to enable a dramatic transformation in the  		delivery of health care, making it safer, more effective, and more efficient,"  		the report concludes. "However, widespread implementation of HIT has been  		limited by a lack of generalizable knowledge about what types of HIT and  		implementation methods will improve care and manage costs for specific health  		organizations." </p>
<p>Large health care organizations and health plans have been leaders in  		health IT. The report points out that, by contrast, the smaller medical  		practices and hospitals that constitute the majority of the nation's health  		care providers have limited technological expertise and must depend on the  		purchase of commercial systems. Data about health IT implementation in these  		settings has been very limited, according to the report. </p>
<p>As a result, a predominant portion of health care providers in America  		have not had the information they need to calculate the impact of health IT  		implementation on their organizations. </p>
<p>"Health care providers need reliable information that tells them what  		they can expect when they implement health IT systems," said AHRQ Director  		Carolyn M. Clancy, M.D. "Leading institutions in health IT have shown that  		these systems can produce improved quality and patient safety. But smaller  		practices and hospitals need to know how these improvements can be achieved in  		settings like theirs, using the kinds of commercial systems they are likely to  		employ. AHRQ's health IT initiative is designed to generate and share the kind  		of information providers need." </p>
<p>Dr. Clancy said AHRQ's health IT initiative will help deliver this kind  		of information. The $166 million initiative includes more than 100 projects  		where health IT systems are being implemented, with an emphasis on systems in  		community-based health care settings, using commercially available systems. The  		AHRQ initiative was launched in September 2004, and most projects have 3-year  		duration. </p>
<p>The AHRQ-sponsored research will yield scientifically valid information  		that will share the experiences of typical providers in implementing health IT  		systems. This includes both the impact on quality and safety of care as well as  		the organizational impact of implementing health IT systems. </p>
<p>"AHRQ's initiative is a real-world laboratory, showing how health IT can  		be used successfully in typical health care settings," Dr. Clancy said. "The  		experiences of our grantees will be shared broadly to help all health care  		providers more successfully adopt health IT." </p>
<p>Findings from the AHRQ projects are being made available through the  		AHRQ National Resource Center for Health Information Technology, at  		<a href="http://www.healthit.ahrq.gov/">http://www.healthit.ahrq.gov</a>. </p>
<p>The report released today was prepared by the Southern California  		Evidence-based Practice Center-RAND Corporation, one of 13 evidence-based  		practice centers supported by AHRQ. Another study released last year by a  		separate group of RAND researchers estimated that wide adoption of electronic  		medical records and other health IT could save more than $81 billion annually  		and improve the quality of care. </p>
<p>The report was requested and funded by AHRQ and the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. The Office of Disease  		Prevention and Health Promotion also provided financial support. Others  		requesting the report were HHS' Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services  		and the Leapfrog Group, an organization of health care purchasers. </p>
<p>When the embargo lifts at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 11, the report  		will be available at  		<a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/hitsyscosts/hitsys.pdf">  		http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/hitsyscosts/hitsys.pdf</a>.

<h2><a name="preface" id="preface">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its  		Evidence-Based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of evidence  		reports and technology assessments to assist public- and private-sector  		organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care in the  		United States. This report was requested and funded by the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) with additional funding  		from the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the report was requested  		by the Leap Frog Group and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services  		(CMS). The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive,  		science-based information on common, costly medical conditions and new health  		care technologies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific  		literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses  		when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. </p>
<p>To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence  		reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form  		partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research  		organizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that  		the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become  		building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the  		nation. The reports undergo peer review prior to their release. </p>
<p>AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments  		will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers, as well as the  		health care system as a whole, by providing important information to help  		improve health care quality. </p>

<p><b>Objectives</b>: An evidence report was prepared to assess the  		evidence base regarding benefits and costs of health information technology  		(HIT) systems, that is, the value of discrete HIT functions and systems in  		various healthcare settings, particularly those providing pediatric care. </p>
<p><b>Data Sources</b>: PubMed®, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical  		Trials Register, and the Cochrane Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE)  		were electronically searched for articles published since 1995. Several reports  		prepared by private industry were also reviewed. </p>
<p><b>Review Methods</b>: Of 855 studies screened, 256 were included in the  		final analyses. These included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, studies that  		tested a hypothesis, and predictive analyses. Each article was reviewed  		independently by two reviewers; disagreement was resolved by consensus. </p>
<p><b>Results</b>: Of the 256 studies, 156 concerned decision support, 84  		assessed the electronic medical record, and 30 were about computerized  		physician order entry (categories are not mutually exclusive). One hundred  		twenty four of the studies assessed the effect of the HIT system in the  		outpatient or ambulatory setting; 82 assessed its use in the hospital or  		inpatient setting. Ninety-seven studies used a randomized design. There were 11  		other controlled clinical trials, 33 studies using a pre-post design, and 20  		studies using a time series. Another 17 were case studies with a concurrent  		control. Of the 211 hypothesis-testing studies, 82 contained at least some cost  		data. We identified no study or collection of studies, outside of those from a  		handful of HIT leaders, that would allow a reader to make a determination about  		the generalizable knowledge of the study's reported benefit. Beside these  		studies from HIT leaders, no other research assessed HIT systems that had  		comprehensive functionality and included data on costs, relevant information on  		organizational context and process change, and data on implementation. </p>
<p>A small body of literature supports a role for HIT in improving the  		quality of pediatric care. Insufficient data were available on the costs or  		cost-effectiveness of implementing such systems. </p>
<p>The ability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve the quality  		of care in ambulatory care settings was demonstrated in a small series of  		studies conducted at four sites (three U.S. medical centers and one in the  		Netherlands). The studies demonstrated improvements in provider performance  		when clinical information management and decision support tools were made  		available within an EHR system, particularly when the EHRs had the capacity to  		store data with high fidelity, to make those data readily accessible, and to  		help translate them into context-specific information that can empower  		providers in their work. </p>
<p>Despite the heterogeneity in the analytic methods used, all cost-benefit  		analyses predicted substantial savings from EHR (and health care information  		exchange and interoperability) implementation: The quantifiable benefits are  		projected to outweigh the investment costs. However, the predicted time needed  		to break even varied from three to as many as 13 years. </p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b>: HIT has the potential to enable a dramatic  		transformation in the delivery of health care, making it safer, more effective,  		and more efficient. Some organizations have already realized major gains  		through the implementation of multifunctional, interoperable HIT systems built  		around an EHR. However, widespread implementation of HIT has been limited by a  		lack of generalizable knowledge about what types of HIT and implementation  		methods will improve care and manage costs for specific health organizations.  		The reporting of HIT development and implementation requires fuller  		descriptions of both the intervention and the organizational/economic  		environment in which it is implemented. </p>
<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The United States health care system is at risk due to increasing  		demand, spiraling costs, inconsistent and poor quality of care, and  		inefficient, poorly coordinated care systems. Some evidence suggests that  		health information technology (HIT) can improve the efficiency,  		cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of medical care delivery by making best  		practice guidelines and evidence databases immediately available to clinicians,  		and by making computerized patient records available throughout a health care  		network. However, much of the evidence is based on a small number of systems  		developed at academic medical centers, and little is known about the  		organizational changes, costs, and time required for community practices to  		successfully implement off-the-shelf systems. </p>
<p>An analysis of the usefulness of implementing HIT must take into  		consideration several factors: </p>
<ul><li>The potential of this technology to improve health care quality,  		  safety, and patient satisfaction--and how this potential has been demonstrated.  		  </li>
<li>The cost-effectiveness of the technology--the business case for  		  adoption of the technology--including the total costs of implementation (both  		  financial and in terms of resources) and any cost savings that accrue.

</ul><p>The Leap Frog Group and a number of components of the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services (HHS)--the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid  		Services (CMS), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE), the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion  		(ODPHP), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)--requested a  		review of the research on HIT to compile and evaluate the evidence regarding  		the value of discrete HIT functions and systems in various health care  		settings. This Evidence-based Practice Report on the costs and benefits of  		health information technology systems, along with an accompanying interactive  		database that catalogs and assesses the existing evidence was prepared by the  		Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC). This report  		systematically reviews the literature on the implementation of HIT systems in  		all care settings and assesses the evidence in four specific circumstances:  		</p>
<ol type="1"><li><i>The costs and benefits of HIT for pediatric care. </i></li>
<li><i>The ability of one aspect of HIT, the electronic health record  		  (EHR), to improve the quality of care in ambulatory care settings. </i></li>
<li><i>The costs and cost-effectiveness of implementing HER. </i></li>
<li><i>The effect of HIT on making care more patient-centered. </i></li>
</ol><h3>Methods</h3>
<p>An electronic search of PubMed, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials  		Register, and the Cochrane Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) was  		conducted for articles published from 1995 to January 2004. Additional  		references were obtained by reviewing the references in several major reports  		prepared by private industry and by RAND Health. Two reviewers, each trained in  		the critical analysis of scientific literature, independently reviewed each  		study and resolved disagreements by consensus. The principal investigator  		resolved any disagreements that remained unresolved after discussions between  		the reviewers. </p>
<p>Studies selected for review had to be either: </p>
<ul><li>A meta-analysis. </li>
<li>A systematic review. </li>
<li>Original research that tested a hypothesis (that is, a report that  		  compared data between groups or across time periods, assessing a specific  		  question and using statistical tests to assess differences). </li>
<li>Original research that conducted predictive analyses (a report that  		  used modeling techniques and simulations to predict the effects of an HIT  		  implementation). </li>
</ul><p>Of 855 articles screened, 256 were accepted for review. Descriptive  		studies of HIT implementations were identified and classified according to the  		categories listed below, but were not reviewed in more detail. </p>
<p>The contents of each selected article or report were abstracted using  		electronic data-abstraction forms prepared especially for this analysis.  		Abstracted data included the system's capabilities, interventions used, study  		design, implementation processes, evaluation methods, outcomes, costs, and  		barriers to implementation. A structured abstract was created for each report;  		these abstracts can be accessed in an online, interactive database created for  		this evidence report. (This database can be accessed at  		<a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand">http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand</a>.) </p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p><b>Overall Results</b></p>
<p>Of the 256 studies reviewed, 156 were about decision support, 84  		assessed the electronic medical record, and 30 were about computerized  		physician order entry (CPOE). One hundred twenty-four of the studies assessed  		the effect of the HIT system in the outpatient or ambulatory setting, while 82  		assessed its use in the hospital or inpatient setting. Ninety-seven studies  		used a randomized design. There were 11 controlled clinical trials, 33 studies  		that used a pre/post design, 20 studies that did a time series, and another 17  		that were case studies with a concurrent control. Among the 211  		hypothesis-testing studies, 81 contained at least some cost data. </p>
<p>Many of the studies concerned HIT systems developed and evaluated by  		academic and institutional leaders in HIT. </p>
<ul><li>Regenstrief Institute in Indianapolis, IN (18 studies) </li>
<li>Partners/Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA (19 studies)  		  </li>
<li>Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, UT (11 studies) </li>
<li>Kaiser Permanente health care system (5 studies) </li>
<li>Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN (2 studies) </li>
<li>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system (15  		  studies) </li>
</ul><p>Studies from these institutions have contributed greatly to our  		knowledge about the usefulness of particular HIT functionalities (such as CPOE  		or computerized electronic alerts), and are examples of what can be realized by  		the implementation of broadly functional HIT at these specific institutions.  		But these studies also have limitations, in terms of their usefulness to inform  		decisions about the adoption of HIT elsewhere. The primary limitation is that  		these HIT systems were developed over the course of many years by technology  		champions at these institutions and, in a process of co-evolution, were adapted  		particularly to the working environment and culture of their respective  		institutions. Consequently, the "intervention" at these sites consists not only  		of the HIT system but also the local champions, who were often also the  		evaluators in published studies. Furthermore, it is challenging to calculate  		the cost of the development of the HIT system as a whole, since this process  		occurred over many years at each institution. In addition, these systems are  		not commercially available from a vendor--and vendors supply most HIT systems  		in use in the U.S. </p>
<p>We were able to identify only 15 studies that used a randomized or  		controlled clinical (RCT or CCT) design, included cost data, and assessed HIT  		systems that were not from one of the leading academic and institutional HIT  		institutions or the United Kingdom (another setting that has limited  		generalizability to U.S. health care institutions). When these 15 studies were  		examined for their HIT functionality using the classification system developed  		by the Institute of Medicine, 4 of them concerned only decision support and 4  		assessed HIT systems with decision support and administrative processes. The  		remaining seven studies addressed other single functionalities or combinations  		of up to three functionalities. We were not able to find a single study that  		used a randomized or controlled clinical trial design, that did not report data  		from one of the leading academic or institutional HIT systems or the U.K., that  		reported cost outcomes and that assessed an HIT system including at least four  		of the eight IOM categories of functionality. </p>
<p>For the 103 hypothesis-testing studies that used a design other than a  		randomized or controlled clinical trial, 45 reported cost data. Of these 45  		studies, 23 assessed systems that were not one of the leading academic or  		institutional HIT systems or that came from the U.K. An examination of these 23  		studies for their functionalities showed, as in the studies using an RCT or CCT  		design, that most studies did not evaluate systems with a broad level of  		functionality. Five studies assessed only decision support, and three studies  		each assessed only administrative processes or order entry management. Three  		studies assessed HIT systems with two functionalities, order entry management  		and decision support. The remaining nine studies assessed various combinations  		of two or three functionalities. No study evaluated an HIT system with at least  		four of the eight categories of functionality. </p>
<p>The literature is even sparser regarding information about the  		organizational context of an HIT implementation. Of the hypothesis-testing  		studies, we identified only 3 studies that provided information about the  		financial context of the organization, such as the degree of managed  		care/capitation penetration; 6 studies with information about system  		penetration; 2 studies about facilitators to implementation; 1 study explicitly  		discussing sustainability of the HIT intervention; 12 studies reporting  		extrinsic factors in valuing costs and benefits such as the health care market  		competitiveness; and 6 and 9 studies, respectively, reporting the initial costs  		of the HIT system and costs of implementation. </p>
<p>In summary, we identified no study or collection of studies--outside of  		those from a handful of HIT leadership institutions--that would allow a reader  		to make a determination whether the study's reported benefit was generalizable.  		Besides these studies from HIT leaders, no other research assessed HIT systems  		that had comprehensive functionality while including data on costs, relevant  		information on organizational context and process change, and data on  		implementation. This limitation in generalizable knowledge is not only a matter  		of study design and internal validity. Even if further randomized, controlled  		trials are performed, the generalizability of the evidence would remain low  		unless additional systematic, comprehensive, and relevant descriptions and  		measurements are made regarding how the technology is utilized, the individuals  		using it, and the environment it is used in. </p>
<p><b>The Costs and Benefits of HIT in Pediatric Settings </b></p>
<p>Early evidence shows that stand-alone clinical decision-support systems  		(CDSS) (such as drug dosing calculators) can reduce medication dosing errors,  		and CPOE plus CDSS can reduce the incidence of harmful medication errors in the  		inpatient pediatric and neonatal intensive care settings. Other HIT systems,  		such as electronic medication administration records, pharmacy-based robots,  		smart infusion pumps/devices, and medication bar-coding, are predicted to  		reduce medication errors, but need further study. </p>
<p>The use of CPOE plus CDSS has been demonstrated, in separate studies, to  		(1) reduce the frequency or duration of antibiotic use for common pediatric  		illnesses such as pharyngitis and otitis media, and (2) improve completeness  		and reduce variation in clinical documentation. In the ambulatory setting, a  		single study showed that an appointment reminder system is cost-effective and  		significantly reduces missed appointments, while in the neonatal intensive care  		unit, another study showed that CPOE can reduce medication and radiology  		turnaround times. Therefore, the evidence for HIT cost-savings in pediatrics is  		limited, but appears optimistic. </p>
<p><b>Electronic Health Records and the Quality of Ambulatory Care </b></p>
<p>Adoption of EHR systems is widely believed to be critical to the  		delivery of consistent, high-quality health care, although the current use of  		EHRs is limited. Seven studies were identified on the use of EHR in four  		ambulatory care settings (three in the United States and one in the  		Netherlands). The findings reported in all of these studies were primarily  		related to the implementation processes and to changes in clinical processes.  		</p>
<p>With the exception of one study that examined the effects of  		incorporating HIV care guidelines and alerts on quality of care for  		HIV-positive patients, all the studies assessed the effects of adding various  		types of information related to laboratory test and prescription ordering to  		EHR ordering screens. In general, these studies showed that providing  		laboratory test guidelines and related information on test-ordering screens was  		associated with a decrease in orders for overused tests and an increase in  		orders for underused tests; provision of formulary guidance was associated with  		increased adherence to a formulary for at least one class of medication; and  		addition of HIV care guidelines and alerts was associated with improved quality  		of care. </p>
<p><b>The Economic Value of an EHR System </b></p>
<p>While EHR systems may be essential for improving efficiency and quality  		of health care, implementation of an EHR system requires substantial capital  		investments and organizational change. Consequently, many health care  		organizations are seeking evidence from previously implemented systems about  		the costs and benefits of EHR adoption in order to better inform decisions  		about the optimal timing and strategy for implementation. </p>
<p>Not all of the costs and benefits reported when implementing new systems  		or making changes to existing systems were financial. EHRs were associated with  		improvements in service and other resource utilization, provider productivity,  		care efficiency, documentation quality, clinical decisionmaking, guideline  		compliance, and costs of care. </p>
<p>Despite considerable variation among the few studies that modeled  		financial costs and benefits, all predicted substantial cost savings from EHR  		implementation. However, these studies each made a number of assumptions, and  		the predicted break-even points ranged from as short a time as 3 years to as  		long as 13 years. </p>
<p><b>HIT and Patient-Centered Care </b></p>
<p>The evidence is sparse for the ability of HIT systems to make health  		care more patient-centered. The best evidence of such a change is the  		beneficial effect on preventive care of using computerized reminders to  		patients. Telemedicine and consumer health informatics also have limited  		evidence of benefit in specific contexts. The evidence is much more limited  		about the health effects of more general, interactive health information  		technologies such as the Internet or e-mail, or the effect on patient trust and  		satisfaction of implementing HIT systems such as the electronic health record.  		</p>
<p><b>Barriers to HIT Implementation </b></p>
<p>Studies identified a large number of barriers to the implementation of  		HIT. These barriers can be classified as situational barriers (including time  		and financial concerns), cognitive and/or physical barriers (including users'  		physical disabilities and insufficient computer skills), liability barriers  		(including confidentiality concerns), and knowledge and attitudinal barriers.  		Cutting across all of these categories, however, may be the need for a major  		structural and ideological reorganization of clinical medicine as it is now  		practiced in the majority of settings to be able to integrate itself with and  		enjoy the benefits of HIT. </p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p><b>Limitations of the Review </b></p>
<ul><li>The primary limitation of this review is the quality, quantity, and  		  generalizability of the available (published) studies. Substantially more  		  information regarding implementation may have been obtained by contacting  		  leading HIT implementers and conducting structured interviews with them. </li>
<li>Many of the costs and financial benefits of EHR will change over the  		  years, because they depend on the changing price of such factors as hardware,  		  software, labor, and pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Consequently, the  		  costs reported in some of the older articles are of limited relevance. </li>
</ul><p><b>General Conclusions </b></p>
<ul><li>Predictions based on statistical models suggest that HIT has the  		  potential to assist in dramatically transforming the delivery of health care,  		  making it safer, more effective, and more efficient. However, the experimental  		  evidence supporting benefits from HIT is more limited. </li>
<li>A number of large health care organizations have realized some of  		  these major gains through the implementation of multifunctional, interoperable  		  HIT systems built around an electronic health record. </li>
<li>The impact of HIT implementation on the cost and quality of care is  		  not going to be consistent across institutions, independent of context.  		  However, the specific context within which HIT is implemented, including the  		  setting, the clinical issues, and the patient populations, greatly influences  		  its use and effects. </li>
<li>More widespread implementation of HIT is limited by the lack of  		  generalizable knowledge about what types of HIT and methods for its  		  implementation will prove most useful for specific health organizations,  		  especially for small practices and small hospitals. </li>
<li>The reporting of HIT developments and implementations needs to be  		  improved, with greater attention given to descriptions of both the intervention  		  and the organizational/economic environment in which the technology is  		  implemented. </li>
<li>A high priority must be placed on establishing standards for the  		  information that needs to be measured and reported in studies of HIT  		  implementation, similar to the CONSORT standards developed for reporting  		  clinical trials of therapeutics. </li>
<li>Using existing published evidence, it is not possible to draw firm  		  conclusions about which HIT functionalities are most likely to achieve certain  		  health benefits--and the assessment of costs is even more uncertain. </li>
<li>Existing evidence is not sufficient to clearly define "who pays for"  		  and "who benefits from" HIT implementation in any health care  		  organization--except those, such as Kaiser and the VA, that are responsible for  		  paying for and delivering all the care for the defined population. </li>
<li>Statistical models can be built to estimate the costs and benefits of  		  interoperable HIT systems within and across health care provider settings,  		  payers/purchasers, and cumulatively across the health care continuum, but these  		  models are based on many untested assumptions. </li>
<li>Implementation of HIT faces many barriers, including institutional  		  barriers, cognitive and/or physical barriers, liability barriers, and knowledge  		  and attitudinal barriers. </li>
</ul><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The use of health information technology (HIT) has been promoted as  		having tremendous promise in improving the efficiency, cost-effectiveness,  		quality, and safety of medical care delivery in our nation's healthcare system.  		The realization of these benefits is especially important in the context of  		reports that show five years of consecutive annual double-digit increases in  		healthcare costs and increases in the numbers of adverse health  		events.<sup><font><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">2</a></font></sup> At the same time, reports have suggested that  		50 percent of all healthcare dollars are wasted on inefficient processes.  		Legislators and organizational leaders at the federal and state levels have  		emphasized the need for healthcare to follow the example of many non-healthcare  		industries, in which implementation of computer information technology has been  		critical in increasing the accessibility of mission-critical information,  		automating labor-intensive and inefficient processes, and minimizing human  		error. </p>
<p>The most important use for HIT may be to help reduce medical errors.  		This technology-based strategy has proven effective in reducing the effects of  		human error in industries such as banking and aviation. Clinical HIT systems  		may make a substantial impact on medical quality and safety by integrating  		relevant automated decisionmaking and knowledge acquisition tools into the  		practices of medical providers, thereby reducing errors of omission that result  		from gaps in provider knowledge or the failure to synthesize and apply that  		knowledge in clinical practice. These systems, when integrated within larger  		HIT systems, may improve medical decisionmaking and appropriate use of  		diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents. </p>
<p>In the ambulatory healthcare environment, the use of HIT offers a  		variety of benefits. First, it can improve the efficiency and financial health  		of the practice. For years, many offices have used computerized scheduling and  		financial systems to streamline office processes by tracking practice  		productivity and automating reimbursement processes. Second, the use of  		ambulatory electronic health records (EHRs) also offers an opportunity to  		monitor and improve clinical quality by improving information access and  		reducing duplicative documentation. And technology-based "e-prescribing" tools  		may improve the efficiency and safety of prescribing practices in the  		outpatient setting just as they have done in the hospital setting. Finally, the  		widespread adoption of HIT will allow the achievement of system connectivity  		and information exchange among providers of the same organization, among  		organizations, and ultimately regionally and nationwide. </p>
<p>However, the majority of medical organizations and providers have been  		slow to adopt HIT. Recent surveys of computerized physician order entry (CPOE)  		use show that only 9.6 percent of hospitals have CPOE completely available for  		use, and only half of these hospitals require use of CPOE.<sup><font><a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup> In the ambulatory setting, recent  		estimates place the use of electronic health records at 6 to15 percent of  		office-based physicians.<sup><font><a href="#ref4">4</a>,  		<a href="#ref5">5</a></font></sup> The potential advantages of widespread  		adoption of HIT in our nation's healthcare system make it vital to examine the  		scientific evidence that currently supports the relative costs and benefits of  		HIT, and the barriers to implementing various types of HIT systems across the  		spectrum of healthcare environments. </p>
<h3>A Framework for Considering the Costs and Benefits of  		Health Information Technology</h3>
<p>Private organizations deciding whether to invest in HIT must weigh the  		costs and benefits of doing so. Although the primary goal of nonprofit  		healthcare organizations may be to provide high-quality care, these  		organizations still need to watch the bottom line to survive, which includes  		understanding the costs of measures designed to improve quality. Such private  		return-on-investment (ROI) calculations can provide results that are quite  		different from those of societal cost-benefit analysis, which are often  		reported in clinical journals. </p>
<p>For example, one study showed that a hospital that installed a  		computerized reminder system to alert providers when patients were not  		up-to-date on their immunizations increased pneumococcal vaccine orders by 8  		percent.<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a></font></sup> Another study  		showed that, among the elderly, each $12 vaccination averts $20.27 in hospital  		costs and increases life expectancy an average of 1.2 days.<sup><font><a href="#ref7">7</a></font></sup> From society's point of view, the  		reminder system saves money and improves health, so it is a win-win program.  		However, from a financial perspective, the hospital has spent money on a system  		that had no effect on the costs or revenues of current stays because the  		pneumococcal vaccine is not delivered in the hospital. To benefit from this  		intervention, the hospital must make a reputation for higher quality and  		convert it into profits. This is one example of the potential for a mismatch  		between who pays for and who accrues cost savings from HIT use. A more extreme  		example would be a hospital's implementation of a HIT intervention that averts  		future hospitalization. In this case, HIT implementation both costs the  		hospital money and decreases hospital revenues, even if the HIT implementation  		has a net cost-savings from a societal (or Medicare) perspective. </p>
<h3>Elements of the Business Case</h3>
<p>The business case for investing in HIT must consider both financial and  		nonmonetized<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup>  		consequences. The financial aspect deals with the effect on the organization's  		bottom line. Any HIT investment has immediate costs in purchase, adaptation to  		the local organization, and staff training. So the business case for HIT  		depends on the downstream financial benefits exceeding the immediate costs.  		Because profits = revenue - costs = (revenue per patient - costs per patient)  		× (number of patients), long-term profits can come from increases in  		(profitable) patients, increases in revenues per patient, or decreases in cost  		per patient. The easiest of these to understand is costs per patient. All  		organizations benefit from becoming more efficient and reducing the costs of  		providing particular services. HIT can reduce the waste involved in collecting  		information and getting it to where it is needed for better decisionmaking.  		This increase in efficiency can streamline health care and billing processes,  		and avoid the costs of unnecessary services and of dealing with errors, both in  		patient care and in billing. Also, working in high quality organizations has  		some intangible benefits to staff, which may lead to better retention and  		productivity at equal levels of pay. </p>
<p>However, if the HIT is used to raise the quality of care or change the  		mix of services provided, the resulting financial costs and benefits depend on  		how the organization is paid and what expenses it bears. These factors can  		greatly affect what kind of return on investment is likely and when it will be  		realized. The next three paragraphs provide some examples. </p>
<p>A reputation for higher quality should increase the demand for an  		organization's services in a competitive market, but it is difficult to prove  		that you are better than your competition or better than you used to be. HIT  		can raise quality and can also generate the statistics to prove you have done  		so. Perceived higher quality allows organizations to increase market share and  		to negotiate higher prices from payers whose members demand access to those  		organizations, even if they have to pay slightly higher premiums to get it. In  		a competitive fee-for-service environment, greater market share increases  		revenues and may also permit some economies of scale. </p>
<p>HIT can also be used to increase reimbursable services per patient, such  		as covered immunizations and exams. HIT pays if it reduces waste, but it  		reduces profit if it reduces current or downstream services. Hospitals whose  		payments are set by DRGs (a fixed payment that depends on the diagnosis of the  		patient but does not vary with actual costs) benefit somewhat from shorter  		length of stay (although the last days of a hospitalization are the cheapest),  		but not from reduced readmissions (except those where a Medicare patient  		bounces back into the hospital before sufficient time lapses post-discharge to  		qualify the readmission for reimbursement as a "new" episode of care). A  		hospital also will not benefit financially from interventions that shift care  		to physicians' practices. </p>
<p>The biggest gains from quality and HIT come when providers are paid by  		means of a capitated fee system. Under such a system, any investment that  		reduces the total costs of care for these patients can be recouped, so it pays  		to reduce unnecessary services and to provide care in the most efficient  		setting. HIT may help to share the information needed to do so. Such reasoning  		was behind the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA's) decision to develop its  		HIT system. Most published examples of cost-saving quality projects come from  		health maintenance organizations (HMOs)--for example, better diabetes or heart  		failure care that keeps patients out of the hospital. Also for HMOs, high  		quality can offset other undesirable features--such as poor access or  		amenities--or can justify higher premiums. The gains to HMOs of better care  		will be more certain when capitation payments are adequately risk adjusted.  		Without risk adjustment, providing high quality chronic illness care, an area  		where HIT is particularly useful, may have the unprofitable side effect of  		attracting more-expensive patients. </p>
<p>Because some of the financial gains from high quality may go to  		purchasers (employers) rather than providers, particularly in noncapitated,  		fee-for-service environments, some purchasers have started to pay directly for  		quality. If the case for HIT were strong enough, insurers might want to  		subsidize it in part (i.e., based on the insurer's share of the provider's  		caseload). However, unless an insurer covers most of the patients in a  		particular health care organization or insurers agree to collaborate, it does  		not pay one insurer to subsidize HIT for an entire provider or organization  		because a substantial portion of the cost savings accrue to other payers (the  		"free rider" problem). </p>
<p>Non-healthcare businesses that are selecting investments might consider  		only financial return on investment (ROI), but providing health care is a  		business with an unusual emphasis on nonmonetized goals. The nonmonetized part  		of the business case includes all nonmonetary arguments that the organization  		feels will influence the decision to adopt or reject the intervention. Examples  		include the following: </p>
<ul><li>Maintaining credentials </li>
<li>Satisfying reporting requirements </li>
<li>Satisfying a requirement to do a quality improvement project </li>
<li>Avoiding exposure to liability </li>
<li>Building goodwill or reputation </li>
<li>"Because it's the right thing to do." </li>
</ul><p>Many of these nonmonetized items have financial aspects. For example,  		the intervention may reduce the cost of meeting a preexisting reporting  		requirement. Also, many organizations, particularly nonprofits, have  		nonfinancial goals--such as providing high quality care--in addition to  		financial goals.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>What Is Generalizable Knowledge Regarding Health  		Information Technology?</h3>
<p>In this report, we use the term <i>generalizable knowledge</i> to mean  		published evidence of the effects of a HIT intervention on costs and benefits  		that other health care organizations can use to implement HIT and reasonably  		expect benefits similar to those reported in the original study. Therefore,  		generalizable knowledge from a study has two components: (1) the internal  		validity of the study and (2) the utility of the information to others  		considering implementing HIT. We can illustrate differences in generalizable  		knowledge by considering some examples. </p>
<p>The simplest example is that of a particular pharmaceutical therapy for  		patients with a certain condition. In this case, a randomized,  		placebo-controlled trial of the new pharmaceutical agent would be a study with  		good internal validity. Because pharmaceuticals are manufactured for  		consistency in strength and are given according to specified dosing schedules,  		another health care organization examining the results of such a study could  		reasonably assume that administration of the new pharmaceutical in the same  		doses and to patients with similar characteristics would result in benefits  		similar to those reported in the original study. </p>
<p>A second example would be the assessment of a new surgical therapy. In  		such a case, the evidence would not come from a randomized, double blind,  		placebo-controlled trial, since this design is not generally feasible for tests  		of surgical therapy. Data may come from studies comparing patients randomly  		assigned to surgical therapy or to an alternate therapy or nonrandomized  		studies comparing surgically treated patients with historical controls or even  		case series. As the confidence in the equivalence of the comparison groups at  		baseline diminishes, the difference in benefit must become greater for the  		reader to conclude that beneficial effects on outcomes are due to differences  		in therapy and not other differences between groups at baseline. </p>
<p>Even after accepting that a particular study reports a real difference  		in outcomes between groups, the healthcare organization or practitioner  		contemplating offering surgery must consider more factors than when  		contemplating the prescription of a new pharmaceutical agent. Surgical  		therapies are not as standardized as pharmaceutical agents, and outcomes depend  		upon such factors as the skill of the surgical team and hospital. There is no  		reason to expect that every surgeon and hospital delivers equivalent care the  		way physicians and patients can expect a standard dose of a pharmaceutical to  		have equivalent potency. Hence, a study describing the effects of a surgical  		therapy needs to give more detail than a study describing the effects of a  		pharmaceutical drug, namely, enough description of the surgeon and hospital  		that other healthcare organizations or providers can determine whether the  		reported outcomes are likely to be achieved in their own clinical situation.  		</p>
<p>When considering HIT evaluation, the situation becomes even more  		complex. Both the intervention and the subjects of the intervention are  		qualitatively different in a study of HIT than in a study of a pharmaceutical  		or surgical intervention. HIT implementation consists of a complex  		organizational change undertaken to promote quality and efficiency. Studies of  		organizational change are fundamentally different from studies of medical  		therapies. Organizational interventions interact with a wide range of  		organizational system components. To be successful, they must address these  		components in a locally effective way. Thus, in a sense, these interventions  		are by nature not widely generalizable, in contrast to studies of narrow  		interventions such as pharmaceuticals, which aim to identify treatment  		effectiveness that is operator-independent, or generalizable across settings or  		providers. This difference has several important consequences. First,  		randomized controlled trials are not always feasible for assessing  		organizational change. The risks and benefits of reliance on controlled trials  		for evidence about interventions involving organizational change has been  		debated.<sup><font><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></font></sup> However, reliance only on randomized clinical  		trials for evidence of the effect of HIT on costs and outcomes risks  		restricting the focus to narrow and tightly defined elements of HIT. In many  		real-world applications, complex organizational change interventions are  		implemented as a series of steps, with each step dependent on the  		organizational response to the previous step. Therefore, we judge that  		generalizable knowledge must and can come from many types of studies. However,  		we also judge that these studies must report details of the intervention and  		the organizational characteristics of where the intervention was implemented to  		allow other organizations to make judgments about the applicability of the  		results. </p>
<p>We consider the<i> intervention</i> in HIT studies to have at least four  		components: </p>
<ul><li>Technical--including the system components being tested (which may  		  consist of CPOE, clinical charting, or electronic prescribing); the preexisting  		  technology infrastructure (e.g., clinical and financial systems, network); and  		  the existing electronic interfaces and integration. </li>
<li>Human factors (machine-person interface)--system usability (e.g.,  		  "user-friendliness," system response time, intuitive user interface, support  		  for workflow processes), support for specialty or context-specific actions  		  (e.g., clinical content, order-sets, and level and acceptability of clinical  		  decision-support). </li>
<li>Project management--effecting complex sociotechnical process change  		  around HIT implementation, aligning IT and organizational resources to achieve  		  project milestones, and controllership of IT budgets. </li>
<li>Organizational and cultural change, which may include a partnership  		  of medical staff and administrative leadership to govern, align incentives, and  		  mobilize organizational inertia to achieve desired outcomes through process  		  change. </li>
</ul><p>Cutting across all four of these components is effective communication.  		Most organizational change and IT projects have a strong but unrecognized  		communication component, which encompasses, among other things, the sharing of  		vision, values, and information about the components of HIT system selection,  		as well as its implementation and use. </p>
<p>Without an adequate description of all of these components in a study of  		HIT costs and benefits, it is difficult for others to be able to infer how, or  		even whether, they can reproduce the results. Omitting such information would  		be analogous to omitting the strength or dosing schedule from the report of a  		study of a pharmaceutical intervention.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, the analogue of the patient in a study of HIT is the  		<i>organization</i>. No consensus exists regarding what aspects of the  		organization are most important to report, but some aspects are clearly  		important. Aspects that have been proposed as important include size, staffing,  		the organization's prior experience with quality improvement initiatives,  		processes expected to be influenced by the intervention and how these work  		currently, and the financial context of the organization. These characteristics  		may well determine which types of HIT interventions work in a given setting.  		For this review, we assessed (a) whether studies measured some key  		organizational characteristics and (b) what those characteristics were. Such  		characteristics might be considered key <i>organizational demographics</i>,  		just as gender, age, and illness severity would be considered key demographic  		characteristics for an efficacy and safety study of a new pharmaceutical. </p>
<p>However, knowing even these characteristics may not be enough to  		understand why a HIT intervention did or did not work. An organization has to  		do more than simply buy the software to be successful. It must also invest in  		adapting the software to the organization, developing new policies and  		procedures, and training staff. The extent to which the organization is willing  		and prepared to perform these and other critical additional functions to embed  		the HIT into all relevant systems determines <i>organizational readiness for  		change</i>. There is unfortunately little scientific knowledge about which  		organizational characteristics are essential, and which, like the color of the  		patient's eyes when assessing the effect of taking a new pill, are unimportant.  		Thus, even if the description of a successful intervention includes many of the  		details described above, without information about organizational readiness,  		readers cannot know whether or not the same intervention is likely to work in  		their own organization and how long and expensive the transitional process  		might be. </p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">CHAPTER 2. METHODS</a></h2>
<h3>Original Proposed Key Questions</h3>
<p>An evidence report on the costs and benefits of HIT systems was  		requested by the Leap Frog Group, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE), the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion  		(ODPHP), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The purpose  		of the report was to develop an evidence base regarding the value of discrete  		HIT functions and systems in various healthcare settings. </p>
<p>Original key questions for the report were: </p>
<ol type="1"><li>What does the evidence show with respect to the costs and benefits of  		  inter-operable electronic HIT data exchange for providers and  		  payers/purchasers? </li>
<li>What is a framework that could be used in this study to describe  		  levels/bundles of EHR functionality and to estimate the costs and benefits by  		  such levels/bundles of functionality by payer/purchaser and percentage of  		  provider penetration? </li>
<li>What knowledge or evidence deficits exist regarding needed  		  information to support estimates of cost, benefit and net value with regard to  		  HIT systems? Discuss gaps in research, including specific areas that should be  		  addressed, and suggest possible public and private organizational types to  		  perform the research and/or analysis. </li>
<li>What critical cost/benefit information is required by decision makers  		  (at various levels) in order to give a clear understanding of HIT Systems value  		  proposition particular to them? </li>
<li>What analytic methods (e.g., sources of data, algorithms, etc.) could  		  be used to produce evidence of the costs and benefits within and across health  		  care provider settings, payers/purchasers, and cumulatively across the health  		  care delivery continuum and payers, of deploying electronic health information  		  technology functions examined in this study? </li>
<li>What are the barriers that health care providers and health care  		  systems encounter that limit implementation of electronic health information  		  systems? </li>
</ol><h3>Technical Expert Panel</h3>
<p>Each AHRQ evidence report is guided by a Technical Expert Panel (TEP).  		We invited a distinguished group of scientists, clinicians, and information  		technology experts, including individuals with expertise in medical  		informatics, Internet health, and telecommunications to participate in the TEP  		for this report. A list of panel members is included as <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a><sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup>. </p>
<p>The TEP's participation in the preparation of the report began with a  		meeting that was conducted via conference call at the start of the project; the  		purpose of this meeting was to get TEP input on the scope of the project,  		especially the specific information technology applications to address. We were  		also seeking input on what constitutes evidence because most of the data on HIT  		implementation derive from interventions that are not RCTs, which are the usual  		backbone of EPC evidence reports. This particular meeting was held at two  		separate times in order to accommodate scheduling conflicts; TEP members were  		asked to participate on the date that was more convenient for them. The  		meetings were held on March 19 and March 26, 2004. </p>
<p>At this meeting, we also discussed the framework for how to conduct our  		research. Many TEP members were interested in HIT implementation issues, for  		example, what can be learned from others who have implemented HIT in various  		settings, including both community and academic settings. They also emphasized  		that HIT is often implemented through multicomponent interventions, of which IT  		is just one aspect. </p>
<p>Based on the comments received during the TEP conference calls and  		numerous discussions with AHRQ, it was determined that the report would focus  		on reviewing the evidence from existing published articles regarding the costs,  		benefits, and barriers to implementing HIT. Many other excellent suggestions  		were received during the conference calls, such as performing new cost-benefit  		analyses or collecting unpublished information on barriers, but the decision  		was made that a review of existing published evidence should precede any other  		analyses. </p>
<h3>Literature Search</h3>
<p>At the time this report was undertaken, another team at RAND was working  		on a project entitled "Leveraging Modern Information Technology to Transform  		Medical Care Delivery." This project, funded by private industry, aimed to  		suggest policy changes that are likely to increase the rate of adoption of HIT  		in the United States. One part of the project involved assessing the effects of  		information technology on costs, health outcomes, and adverse events. We were  		given the list of titles from the team's November 2003 search of PubMed, which  		sought systematic reviews published in English from 1995 to 2003. PubMed, which  		is maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, is widely recognized as  		the premier source for bibliographic coverage of biomedical literature. It  		encompasses information from Index Medicus, the Index to Dental Literature, and  		the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (allied health  		includes occupational therapy, speech therapy, and rehabilitation), as well as  		other sources of coverage in the areas of health care organization, biological  		and physical sciences, humanities, and information science as they relate to  		medicine and health care. </p>
<p>Our own search for studies of HIT began with an electronic search of  		PubMed on January 6, 2004 for reports of original research as well as any  		additional articles about HIT published since 1995. We ordered all articles on  		the HIT topics, regardless of study design or language. <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a> shows our specific search strategies. We also  		searched the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register Database and the  		Cochrane Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). The Cochrane  		Collaboration is an international organization that helps people make  		well-informed decisions about health care by preparing, maintaining, and  		promoting the accessibility of systematic reviews on the effects of heath care  		interventions. In December 2004, we also conducted a specific search of the  		journal <i>Health Affairs</i>, developing a list of all articles with  		"information technology" or "information systems" as keywords. <i>Health  		Affairs</i> has published special editions on this topic in recent years. </p>
<h3>Additional Sources of Evidence</h3>
<p>Several other sources of evidence were considered, based on the  		recommendations of the TEP. <i>Advanced Technologies to Lower Health Care Costs  		and Improve Quality </i>was published in fall 2003 by the Massachusetts  		Technology Collaborative in partnership with the New England Healthcare  		Institute. Research was conducted by the First Consulting Group and was  		sponsored by several Massachusetts companies involved in healthcare and health  		insurance. The report focuses on seven advanced technologies (including  		examples of HIT, such as computerized physician order entry and electronic  		prescribing in the inpatient and ambulatory care setting) that have  		demonstrated both financial benefits and improved quality of care. It also  		includes discussions of barriers to implementation. </p>
<p><i>The Value of Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) in Ambulatory  		Settings </i>was published in 2003 by the Center for Information Technology,  		also located in the Boston area. This group conducted an international search  		for both academic and commercial sources of literature and also contacted 35  		vendors regarding their currently available health information technology  		packages. The report found that CPOE can significantly improve quality while  		lowering costs. </p>
<p><i>Meta-Analysis on Computer-Based Clinical Reminder Systems</i> reports  		on a 1996 metaanalysis of 16 trials by Shea, DuMouchel, and Bahamonde published  		in the<i> Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</i> (JAMIA).  		The authors found that computer reminders in the ambulatory care setting  		improved utilization of vaccinations, breast cancer screenings, and colorectal  		cancer screenings, but not pap smears or other preventive care. Personal files  		were contributed by project staff, consultants, and technical expert panel  		members in response to a request for any applicable unpublished literature on  		the costs and benefits of HIT. </p>
<p>Articles could have been identified in more than one way (for example,  		the PubMed search and personal files might contain some of the same articles).  		</p>
<h3>Article Review</h3>
<p>We reviewed the articles retrieved from the various sources against our  		exclusion criteria to determine whether to include them in the evidence  		synthesis and in the special interactive database tool we created to accompany  		this report (see below). A screening review form that contains a series of  		categorization questions was created to track the articles (see  		<a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a><sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup>). Two reviewers, each trained in the critical  		analysis of scientific literature, independently reviewed each study, and  		resolved disagreements by consensus. The principal investigator resolved any  		disagreements that remained unresolved after discussions between the reviewers.  		</p>
<p>As previously indicated, this report includes evidence from articles  		with many different study designs. Our initial search was unrestricted by study  		design. The resulting articles were divided into four categories: reviews,  		descriptive reports, hypothesis testing-studies, and predictive analysis  		studies. </p>
<p><i>Review articles</i> identified by the search were classified as  		either <i>systematic </i>(including metaanalyses) or <i>nonsystematic</i>. The  		determination of systematic versus nonsystematic was made by reading the  		methods section of the article to see whether an acceptable method was employed  		to identify evidence. This assessment was made by the Center directors working  		independently with consensus resolution. Only systematic reviews were  		considered for further inclusion. </p>
<p>Articles were classified as <i>descriptive </i>if they primarily  		described the workings or implementation of a HIT system. We further classified  		these as qualitative or quantitative, based on the presentation of information  		regarding such factors as number of tests ordered and costs of implementation.  		</p>
<p>A third category of articles was classified as <i>hypothesis-testing</i>  		studies, indicating that researchers attempted to answer a study question by  		comparing data between groups or across time periods and using statistical  		tests to assess differences. Hypothesis testing studies were further classified  		as (1) those containing an intervention with a concurrent comparison group,  		which included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials and controlled  		before-after studies; and (2) studies with an intervention but without a  		concurrent comparison group, which included pre-post studies, time-series  		studies with more than two measurement points, and studies that used a  		historical control group. Additional classifications of hypothesis testing  		studies included those without an intervention, which were cross-sectional in  		nature, and "other" hypothesis testing studies. </p>
<p>The fourth category of studies was <i>predictive analyses</i>, which  		included studies that used modeling techniques to predict what <i>might</i>  		happen with a HIT implementation rather than what <i>did</i> happen. Predictive  		analyses include cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. They typically  		use data from multiple studies and depend upon several assumptions, some of  		which are not always explicitly stated. </p>
<p><b>Selection of Articles and Data Elements for Interactive  		Database</b></p>
<p>Articles that were classified as systematic reviews, meta-analyses,  		hypothesis-testing, or predictive analyses went on to more detailed review. For  		reasons discussed below, we created structured abstracts for these articles and  		placed them in an interactive database of HIT studies  		(<a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand">http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand</a>). </p>
<p>We looked for the following data in each article: a description of the  		HIT system; the purpose of the study; the year or years the study was  		performed; the study design; the outcomes reported; a description of the study  		settings; the intervention and control arm; the evaluation method; a  		description of the HIT system, including how the system was acquired, the year  		the system was installed, the capability and comprehensiveness of the system;  		the integration of guidelines or decision support; the interoperability; the  		HIT implementation strategy; the financial context, such as whether this is a  		managed care or capitation environment, pay for performance, or area of public  		accountability; the system penetration; facilitators and barriers; evidence of  		the HIT system sustainability; extrinsic factors in valuing costs and benefits;  		the cost of the HIT system or systems, including initial costs of the hardware  		and the software; the cost of implementation, including planning, hiring,  		training, temporary productivity loss, data entry, and other organizational  		resources; anything about long-term cost; and outcomes, in terms of changes in  		healthcare utilization, changes in quality of care and patient safety, changes  		in healthcare costs, changes in efficiency and productivity, changes in  		revenue, and time needed to accrue the benefit. These data were judged to be  		important--and, in some cases, vital--to an understanding of the study's  		results as generalizable knowledge. </p>
<h3>Synthesis of Results</h3>
<p>Based on considerations about a framework for considering costs and  		benefits of HIT and what constitutes generalizable knowledge, we determined  		that a synthesis of the results of the included studies could not be  		meaningfully accomplished using conventional EPC methods for such syntheses. In  		other words, because the interpretation of the results of HIT studies is quite  		context-specific, meta-analysis would not be appropriate. No studies were  		really homogeneous or similar enough to consider together. </p>
<p>Similarly, a narrative review needs an organizing construct, such as  		"studies about CPOE," or "studies of HIT in rural hospitals," or even "studies  		of HIT that incorporate decision support and report benefits and costs for  		patient safety in the capitated ambulatory environment." However, the possible  		combinations of key variables is so vast that any limited number of narrative  		syntheses we might produce for this evidence report would inevitably not meet  		the needs of many potential users. Therefore, we decided that the most useful  		synthesis of this evidence would be in the form of structured abstracts of the  		included studies, presented in the interactive searchable database, which can  		be used by interested readers of this report to identify those HIT studies that  		meet their own particular contextual requirements. We also present four  		narrative reviews of studies in particular contexts, to illustrate the uses of  		the interactive database and also as a mechanism to discuss the strengths and  		limitations of the evidence regarding HIT. </p>
<h3>Peer Review</h3>
<p>A draft of this report was prepared in April 2005 and sent to the TEP  		members and others for review. We received comments from the persons listed in  		<a href="#appendD">Appendix D</a><sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup>. Each comment received was tracked in an  		electronic spreadsheet and addressed in preparing the final report. Peer review  		comments and our responses to them are listed in <a href="#appendE">Appendix  		E</a>. Service as a reviewer of this report should not in any way be construed  		as agreeing with or endorsing the content of the report. </p>
<h2><a name="result" id="result">CHAPTER 3. RESULTS</a></h2>
<p>We screened 855 articles, of which 599 were rejected: 124 did not have  		HIT as the subject; 4 did note report relevant outcomes; 288 were descriptive  		qualitative studies; and 183 were categorized as descriptive quantitative  		studies. A total of 256 articles was included in the HIT interactive database.  		(<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> presents this information pictorially.) </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b><a name="figure1" id="figure1">FIGURE 1</a>. HIT  			 Literature Flow</b></font></td>

</tr></table><h3>Description of the Studies</h3>
<p>Of the 256 studies included in the database, 156 pertained to decision  		support, 84 assessed the electronic medical record, and 30 were about CPOE  		(categories are not mutually exclusive). One hundred twenty four of the studies  		assessed the effect of the HIT system in the outpatient or ambulatory setting,  		while 82 assessed its use in the hospital or inpatient setting. Ninety-seven  		studies used a randomized design; 11 were other controlled clinical trials, 33  		used a pre-post design, 20 used a time series, and another 17 were case studies  		with a concurrent control. Among the 211 hypothesis-testing studies, 82  		contained at least some cost data (or data on utilization or efficiency, that  		could be converted to costs). </p>
<p>Many of the studies concerned HIT systems developed and evaluated by  		academic and institutional leaders in HIT: the Regenstrief Institute,  		Partners/Brigham and Women's Hospital, Intermountain Health, Kaiser,  		Vanderbilt, and the VA health care system. The HIT systems at the Regenstrief  		Institute and Partners were each assessed in 18 and 19 separate studies,  		respectively; 15 assessed the VA health information system; 11 studied  		Intermountain Health; 5 studied Kaiser; and 2 assessed the HIT system at  		Vanderbilt. Studies from these institutions have contributed greatly to our  		knowledge about the usefulness of particular HIT functionalities (such as CPOE  		or computerized electronic alerts) and are examples of what can be realized by  		the implementation of broadly functional HIT at these specific institutions.  		But these studies also have limitations in terms of their usefulness to inform  		decisions about the adoption of HIT in other locations. The primary concern is  		that these HIT systems were developed over the course of many years by  		champions at these institutions, and, in a process of coevolution, were  		specially adapted to the working environment and culture of their respective  		institutions. Consequently, the "intervention" consists of not only the HIT  		system but also its local champions, who were often also the evaluators in  		published studies. Furthermore, it is challenging to calculate the cost of the  		development of the HIT system as a whole, since this process has occurred over  		many years. Finally, these systems are not commercially available from vendors,  		whereas most HIT systems in the United States are commercial systems. </p>
<p>We were able to identify only 15 studies that used a randomized or  		controlled clinical design, included cost data, and assessed HIT systems that  		were not located at one of the leading academic and institutional HIT  		institutions or in the United Kingdom (UK), another setting that has limited  		generalizability to U.S. health care institutions. When these 15 studies were  		examined for their HIT functionality using the classification system developed  		by the Institute of Medicine,<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> four of them concerned only decision support;  		four assessed HIT systems with decision support and administrative processes;  		and one study each assessed HIT systems with health information and data  		storage; health information and data storage with decision support; order entry  		management alone; order entry management with reporting and population health  		management; decision support with patient support and administrative processes;  		and health information with data storage decision support and administrative  		processes. In other words, we were unable to find a single study that used a  		randomized or controlled clinical trial design, reported data from a site other  		than one of the leading academic or institutional HIT systems or the UK,  		reported cost outcomes, and assessed a HIT system that included at least four  		of the eight IOM categories of functionality. </p>
<p>Of 103 hypothesis-testing studies that used a design other than a  		randomized or controlled clinical trial, 45 reported cost data. Of the 45  		studies that reported cost data, 23 assessed systems that were not one of the  		leading academic or institutional HIT systems or UK systems. An examination of  		these 23 studies for their functionalities showed, as in the studies using an  		RCT or CCT design, that most did not evaluate systems with a broad level of  		functionality. Five studies assessed only decision support, and three studies  		each assessed only administrative processes or order entry management. Three  		studies assessed HIT systems with two functionalities: order entry management  		and decision support. The remaining nine studies assessed various combinations  		of two or three functionalities. No study evaluated a HIT system with at least  		four of the eight categories of functionality. </p>
<p>Regarding information about the organizational context of a HIT  		implementation, the literature is even more sparse. Of the hypothesis-testing  		studies, we identified only three studies that provided information about the  		financial context of the organization, such as the degree of managed  		care/capitation penetration; six studies with information about system  		penetration; one study about facilitators to implementation; one studies  		explicitly discussing sustainability of the HIT intervention; twelve studies  		reporting extrinsic factors in valuing costs and benefits, such as the  		healthcare market competitiveness; and six studies and nine studies,  		respectively, reporting on the initial costs of the HIT system and costs of  		implementation. No studies explicitly discussed sustainability of the HIT  		intervention. </p>
<p>In summary, we identified no study or collection of studies, outside of  		those from a handful of HIT leaders, that would allow a reader to make a  		determination about the generalizable knowledge of the system's reported  		benefit. Besides these studies from HIT leaders, no other research assessed HIT  		systems with comprehensive functionality while also including data on costs,  		relevant information on organizational context and process change, and data on  		implementation. This limitation in generalizable knowledge is not simply a  		matter of study design and internal validity: Even if more randomized  		controlled trials are performed, the generalizability of evidence will remain  		low unless more systematic, comprehensive, and relevant descriptions and  		measurements are made regarding how the technology is utilized, the individuals  		using it, and the environment it is used in. </p>
<p>As is apparent from the preceding discussion, the interpretation of  		studies of HIT is highly context-specific and is not amenable to the techniques  		of meta-analysis frequently used in other evidence reports to summarize results  		across studies. Certain functionalities of HIT systems have been the subject of  		recent reviews, such as CPOE,<sup><font><a href="#ref10">10</a></font></sup> computer-based clinical decision support  		systems,<sup><font><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>,  		<a href="#ref13">13</a></font></sup> and the use of computer-based guideline  		implementation systems.<sup><font><a href="#ref14">14</a></font></sup> We will not summarize these reviews here.  		Readers are referred to the interactive database of HIT studies to select those  		studies that are most relevant to their own situation in terms of  		functionalities, clinical settings, outcomes reported, and other factors. The  		remainder of this chapter presents four examples of syntheses of the literature  		for specific situations: the effect of HIT in the field of pediatrics; evidence  		regarding the effect of the electronic health record on quality of ambulatory  		care; studies that report and predict the potential benefits and costs of  		implementation of the electronic health record; and health information  		technology and patient-centered care. </p>
<h3>The Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology  		in Pediatrics</h3>
<p><b>Introduction </b></p>
<p>A decision to implement health information technology should carefully  		weigh the costs and benefits of incorporating it into the clinical environment.  		This is especially true in settings involved in the healthcare of infants and  		children, where patterns of practice and the needs of clinicians are unique. A  		recent report issued by the medical informatics taskforce of the American  		Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) cited a number of special requirements for the  		effective use of electronic medical record (EMR) systems in  		pediatrics.<sup><font><a href="#ref15">15</a></font></sup> The  		practice of primary care and subspecialty pediatrics requires specialized  		collection of growth data, immunization history, longitudinal developmental  		inventories, parent education, age- and weight-based norms and dosing of  		therapeutics, specialized terminologies, and unique school-based forms and  		reports. </p>
<p>In the area of pediatric patient-safety, a growing number of studies  		have described the frequency of medication errors and adverse drug events  		(ADEs) in both the inpatient and ambulatory settings.<sup><font><a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>,  		<a href="#ref19">19</a></font></sup> For a number of reasons--including weight-  		and age-based medication dosing, medication unit-doses designed for adult  		patients, and the limited ability of children to communicate or self-check  		medications before they are administered,<sup><font><a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></font></sup>--infants and  		children are at higher risk for serious medication errors and resultant ADEs  		than are adults. HIT is believed to be a vital component in the quest to  		improve medication safety in pediatrics. </p>
<p>These special requirements, combined with a small commercial market for  		pediatric HIT systems relative to the adult population, make the implementation  		of HIT in the pediatric setting challenging and perhaps costly. Clearly, more  		must be known about the relative costs and benefits of HIT implementation and  		use in pediatrics and evidence of its impact on the six quality aims identified  		in the IOM report, <i>Crossing the Quality Chasm,</i><sup><font><a href="#ref22">22</a></font></sup> to deliver safe, effective, efficient,  		patient-centered, timely, and equitable healthcare. </p>
<p><b>Literature </b></p>
<p>Of the 256 articles included in the database, 14 articles were  		determined to contain quantitative data on the costs and/or benefits of HIT use  		in the pediatric healthcare setting. Because of a paucity of evidence, we also  		included descriptive quantitative studies in this section. </p>
<p><b>Summary of Evidence </b></p>
<p><b>Medication Use and Patient Safety</b>. Given recent insight into the  		prevalence of medication errors in the pediatric population, health information  		technology is believed by most to be an important tool in reducing the rate of  		medication errors that occur in the care of infants and children. </p>
<p>Mullett et al.<sup><font><a href="#ref23">23</a></font></sup>  		enhanced an existing adult antiinfective computerized decision-support system  		for use in an academic pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and measured its  		impact on medication-related outcomes. The study reported a 59-percent decrease  		in pharmacist interventions for erroneous drug doses and a decreased number of  		patient days of subtherapeutic (p&lt;0.001) or excessive (p&lt;0.001)  		antiinfective doses. In addition, the surveyed physicians reported that the use  		of the system improved their antiinfective choices and perhaps reduced the  		likelihood of ADEs. The authors also reported a decreased number of orders per  		patientantiinfective course as well as decreased robust estimated costs of  		antiinfective use by 9 percent in the intervention group vs. control ($86.60  		vs. 78.43). </p>
<p>A study by Fortescue and colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref24">24</a></font></sup> examined and characterized 616 medication  		errors occurring in the pediatric inpatient units of two academic tertiary  		referral medical centers. In a hypothetical experiment, physician experts  		determined what percentage of these errors could potentially have been  		prevented by the implementation of safety systems. Specifically, this  		hypothetical experiment determined that basic CPOE would avert 60 percent of  		potentially harmful errors, while CPOE with clinical decision-support systems  		(CPOE +CDSS) would increase the prevention of harmful errors to 75.8 percent.  		Other HIT systems identified by the report as being important for averting  		medication errors in pediatrics settings included computerized/electronic  		medication administration record (e-MAR) (19.2 percent of potentially harmful  		errors), robots in pharmacy (2.5 percent), smart intravenous infusion devices  		(4.2 percent), medication and patient and staff bar-coding (4.2 percent), and  		an automated bedside medication dispensing device (5.8 percent). </p>
<p>A number of studies have directly measured the benefit of CPOE using a  		variety of error-capture methodologies and study designs in different pediatric  		clinical environments. In a prospective cohort study, the authors documented  		medication prescribing errors (MPEs) and potential adverse drug events (PADEs)  		in a pediatric intensive care unit before and after implementation of a  		"home-grown" CPOE system.<sup><font><a href="#ref25">25</a></font></sup> The data showed a significant reduction of  		both MPEs (30.1 to 90.2 percent, p&lt; 0.001) and PADEs (2.2 to 1.3 percent,  		p&lt;0.001). A study by Cordero and colleagues in the neonatal intensive care  		setting (NICU) showed that CPOE could eliminate gentamicin prescribing errors  		as well.<sup><font><a href="#ref26">26</a></font></sup> The sum of  		this early evidence indicates that CPOE +CDSS has significant potential to  		reduce harmful medication errors, but the relative costs and complexities of  		achieving these beneficial outcomes need to be examined further. </p>
<p><b>Immunizations.</b> Although a growing body of literature suggests  		that the use of HIT in pediatrics may be an important ingredient in reducing  		medication errors, a key challenge for pediatric providers lies in the area of  		maximizing adherence to vaccination recommendations. Paper-based immunization  		records do not allow for rigorous population-based monitoring or quality  		control. Therefore, computerized immunization registries, as separate or  		integrated systems and with clinical decision-support or reporting  		capabilities, offer tremendous potential in tracking and improving the rates of  		adherence to recommended immunization guidelines. </p>
<p>Ornstein et al.<sup><font><a href="#ref27">27</a></font></sup>  		evaluated a computer-based preventive services alerting system integrated into  		an electronic medical record system in an academically affiliated family  		practice clinic. In addition to surveying patient and physicians regarding  		their perceptions of the reminder system, the researchers performed  		before-and-after audits of adherence to recommended preventative services  		including childhood immunizations. Of the five immunization services tracked,  		only the administration of diphtheria and tetanus booster showed a small but  		significant improvement (48.8 to 50.6 percent, p=0.02). Adherence to the other  		recommended vaccinations did not show a significant improvement. </p>
<p>Szilagyi, and colleagues,<sup><font><a href="#ref28">28</a></font></sup> in an academically affiliated pediatric urban  		clinic, used a computerized database system to generate reminder letter for  		influenza vaccination to patients identified with moderate to severe asthma.  		Eligible patients were randomized into an intervention group, which received  		the reminders, and a control group. After four months, a review of the medical  		chart revealed a significant difference in influenza vaccination rates (30  		percent intervention vs. 7 percent control, p&lt;0.01). This study demonstrated  		that computerized disease registry systems could serve as an important tool in  		improving vaccination rates in pediatrics. </p>
<p><b>Effective Disease Management.</b> In addition to providing a  		potential means to influence prescribing and immunization practices in  		pediatrics, HIT systems also hold tremendous promise in improving clinical  		decisionmaking and disease management. </p>
<p><i>Medication Dosage and Delivery.</i> Chiarelli et al.<sup><font><a href="#ref29">29</a></font></sup> evaluated a microprocessor  		device with computerized algorithms for insulin dose adjustment for pediatric  		patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, based on self-monitored  		blood glucose (SMBG) levels. This prospective randomized on-off-on study  		revealed that although the mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels and pre-meal  		SMBG levels did not improve, control patients were more likely to experience  		episodes of hypoglycemia than were patients using the device, and patients  		using the device used less insulin than during their corresponding baseline  		phase (p&lt;0.0001) and less insulin than the control group. </p>
<p><i>Disease-Based Clinical Decision Support.</i> Schriger and  		colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref30">30</a></font></sup> implemented  		an electronic medical record in a university hospital emergency department that  		provided documentation advice and recommendations for laboratory testing and  		treatment. Using an on-off-on interrupted study design, the authors measured  		appropriateness of care for febrile children less than three years of age, when  		measured against an evidence-based guideline. No evidence was found for  		improvements (or worsening) in appropriateness of care during the intervention  		phase compared to the baseline phase. However, use of the system was found to  		increase documentation of essential elements of the history and physical  		examination by 13 percent (95% confidence interval, 10 to 15 percent) as well  		as documentation of after-care instructions by 33 percent (95% confidence  		interval, 28 to 38 percent). </p>
<p>The appropriate course of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media  		(AOM) is an area of concern in pediatrics. A study by Christakis et  		al.<sup><font><a href="#ref31">31</a></font></sup> measure the impact  		of HIT on the antibiotic prescribing behavior of pediatric providers in an  		academic pediatric residency training clinic and compared cohorts during the  		pre-intervention and post-intervention phases. During the postintervention  		phase, providers were randomized to receive point-of-care advice recommending a  		course of antibiotics of less than 10 days duration (primary outcome) or  		delayed initiation of antibiotics (secondary outcome) for the treatment of AOM.  		Measurement of adherence to this computerized alert showed that providers in  		the intervention group had a 34-percent increase compared to the control group  		in the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions that were for less than 10 days  		(p&lt;0.01). However, during the intervention period, both the intervention and  		control groups became more likely to prescribe antibiotics, with the  		intervention group deteriorating less than the control group (p&lt;0.095). The  		results demonstrate that the prescribing practices of pediatricians for  		treatment of a common pediatric illness can be affected by a computerized  		reminder system. </p>
<p>Using a similar study design, Margolis et al.<sup><font><a href="#ref32">32</a></font></sup> developed a computerized algorithm system  		that mandated structured input of data by providers for common pediatric  		problems. In return, the system provided recommendations for disease management  		and correct use of antibiotics. The investigators demonstrated decreased use of  		antibiotics for OM (p&lt;0.001) and pharyngitis (p&lt;0.01) as well as  		increased adherence to protocol recommendations for these two disease processes  		in the intervention group compared with the control group. However, the use of  		antibiotics for upper respiratory infections (URIs) did not change. The authors  		noted that the structured algorithms in the HIT system did improve the  		documentation of clinical elements important to ideal clinical care of  		pharyngitis, otitis media, and upper respiratory infections. It must be noted  		however, that this system's rigid requirements for physician documentation also  		made the HIT system unusable, and the physicians refused to use the system  		after five weeks. </p>
<p><i>Improved Documentation</i>. Because many studies have reported an  		impact of HIT use on the quality and completeness of medical documentation, a  		study by Carroll and colleagues focused on the impact of a personal digital  		assistant (PDA) on documentation discrepancies in a NICU.<sup><font><a href="#ref33">33</a></font></sup> In this before-and-after study,  		all the NICU resident physicians used a PDA-based charting system during the  		intervention phase, comparing their progress notes against a predefined  		reference standard during both phases. The authors demonstrated that after  		adjustment for covariates, PDA-based charting did reduce discrepancies in  		patient weights in the charts but did not affect the number of medication or  		vascular line discrepancies. </p>
<p><i>Timeliness, Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness of Care.  		</i>Quattlebaum et al.<sup><font><a href="#ref34">34</a></font></sup>  		studied a scheduling/practice management system that automatically generated  		reminder postcards for appointment the following week. In this randomized  		controlled trial, the authors demonstrated a reduction of the no-show rate in  		their pediatric ambulatory practice from 19 to 10 percent. A cost-benefit  		analysis of the HIT system and its impact on missed appointments revealed that  		for each $1 spent on reminders, an additional $7.50 of revenue was captured.  		</p>
<p>In the inpatient setting, the previously discussed study of CPOE in the  		NICU by Cordero and colleagues<sup><font><a href="#ref26">26</a></font></sup> measured not only CPOE's effect on gentamicin  		dosing errors but also the time from medication prescription to administration  		for initial doses of a single medication and radiology tests during the pre-  		and post-CPOE phases. The authors documented significant reductions in the  		average turnaround time for both medications (10.5 to 2.8 hours, p&lt;0.01) and  		radiology tests (42 to 32 minutes, p&lt;0.001). </p>
<p><b>Summary </b></p>
<p>Early evidence shows that stand-alone CDSS can reduce medication dosing  		errors, and CPOE + CDSS can reduce the incidence of harmful medication errors  		in the inpatient pediatric and neonatal intensive care settings. However, other  		HIT systems, such as electronic MAR, pharmacy-based robots, smart infusion  		pumps/devices, and medication bar coding, are predicted to reduce medication  		errors but need to be studied further. </p>
<p>HIT also has tremendous potential to improve vaccination rates and  		disease management in pediatric outpatients. CDSS and registries have been  		shown to be effective in increasing vaccination rates in targeted populations,  		but only a limited HIT impact on general pediatric immunization rates has been  		demonstrated. Similarly, a patient clinical decision-support device that  		assists insulin dosing in children with diabetes reduces episodes of  		hypoglycemia and overall insulin requirements, but does not affect traditional  		measurements of glycemic control. And the use of computerized documentation  		systems with integrated CDSS has been demonstrated, in separate studies, to 1)  		reduce the frequency or duration of antibiotic use for common pediatric illness  		such as pharyngitis and otitis media, and 2) improve completeness and somewhat  		reduce variation in clinical documentation. </p>
<p>In the ambulatory setting, a single study showed that an appointment  		reminder system is cost-effective and significantly reduces missed  		appointments. Another study showed that CPOE in the NICU can reduce medication  		and radiology turnaround times. Therefore, the evidence for HIT cost-savings in  		pediatrics is limited but deserving of optimism. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>
<p>A small body of literature supports the assertion that HIT use in  		pediatrics is beneficial in the areas of medication safety, adherence to  		immunization and disease-based guidelines, patient decision-support in diabetes  		management, clinical documentation, patient appointments, and in-hospital order  		processing. No data on the costs or cost-effectiveness of implementing these  		systems were found, except in one case. In addition, because many of these HIT  		systems were tested and/or developed in academic settings, the ability to  		generalize these findings to other organizations is uncertain. </p>
<h3>Electronic Health Records and Quality of Ambulatory  		Care</h3>
<p><b>Introduction </b></p>
<p>Despite rapid advances in the biomedical sciences, a growing body of  		evidence shows serious shortfalls in the quality of care Americans  		receive,<sup><font><a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></font></sup> and significant longstanding shortfalls in  		performance have persisted despite recent increases in attention to  		quality.<sup><font><a href="#ref37">37</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a>,  		<a href="#ref39">39</a>, <a href="#ref40">40</a></font></sup> International  		comparisons have demonstrated similar problems in quality.<sup><font><a href="#ref41">41</a>, <a href="#ref42">42</a>, <a href="#ref43">43</a></font></sup> If the United States is to realize the full  		value of biomedical knowledge and of financial investments made in healthcare,  		the mechanisms through which that knowledge is operationalized and care is  		delivered must be radically redesigned. </p>
<p>Although the content of healthcare continues to change dramatically, the  		methods of health care delivery have not. In particular, a vast majority of the  		healthcare industry continues to deliver care, manage information, and conduct  		clinical transactions through the use of paper records. </p>
<p>Although the use of electronic health records (EHRs) is limited in  		healthcare, there is a renewed conviction by the government, provider groups,  		and healthcare purchasers that widespread adoption is critical to the delivery  		of consistent, high-quality care. However, EHR implementation, without other  		important changes in the way healthcare services are provided, is unlikely to  		improve quality. Such process redesign and reengineering is difficult and  		resource-intensive and is also hampered by the complexity and fragmentation of  		our current healthcare system. Therefore, despite the potential benefits of  		widespread EHR use, better empirical evidence is needed to confirm that EHR use  		does in fact improve quality and--perhaps more fundamentally--to understand  		what capabilities EHRs need to have for quality to be improved. At present, the  		depth and breadth of the empirical evidence regarding EHR use and its  		attributable impact on the quality of care remains unclear. </p>
<p>The purpose of this review is to examine and synthesize the available  		research evidence for the impact of EHR on quality of care in the outpatient  		setting. The review will also attempt to differentiate the direct impact of  		EHRs as point-of-care and workflow tools from how EHRs have been used to  		indirectly achieve those results, by measuring clinical and process outcomes.  		We elected to focus on ambulatory care because of the large volume of health  		services delivered in this arena. In addition, because the vast majority of  		outpatient practices comprise fewer than ten providers--many of whom lack  		technical infrastructure and resources--it is unclear whether widespread  		implementation of EHRs will be feasible in this environment. </p>
<p><b>Research Study Inclusion Criteria </b></p>
<p>From our database of 256 articles, we selected all 84 papers that  		related to EHRs. We then screened these articles against the following  		inclusion criteria: (1) the study reported quality-ofcare data as study  		outcomes, (2) the EHR was documented to have the following minimal  		functionality--electronic documentation (viewing, entry, or both), results  		management, CPOE, and some form of decision support, (3) the study was  		conducted in the ambulatory setting. The criteria for functionality were chosen  		based on the IOM's "White Paper on Key Capabilities of an Electronic Health  		Record." Given the rapid technical advances in EHR systems, we reviewed  		additional functional criteria to provide decisionmakers with the most relevant  		and forward-looking information available. </p>
<p><b>Analytic Framework </b></p>
<p>The Donabedian "Structure--Process--Outcome" model for quality was used  		as a framework for this review.<sup><font><a href="#ref44">44</a></font></sup> In this model, structure is defined as the  		resources and factors involved in producing care and the manner in which those  		resources and factors are organized. Examples of structural quality include the  		number of beds in a hospital, the number of physicians in an emergency room per  		shift, the budget for a clinic, and the presence of disease management program  		for diabetes. Process of care is defined as the activities that constitute  		health care. Examples include screening for breast cancer, ordering laboratory  		tests, and prescribing a medication. Outcomes are the end results of healthcare  		delivery processes. They are the consequences of health services or can be  		logically attributed to the act of providing those services. Whereas structure  		relates to the environment in which healthcare is delivered and process relates  		to the provisions of care, outcomes are events that occur with patients and  		consumers--as individuals, groups, or populations. </p>
<p>Two aspects of this model are particularly relevant to EHRs. First, to  		fully assess quality of care, there need to be links from structure to process  		to outcomes. The technical and functional capabilities of EHRs form a structure  		for care. In order to derive value from the EHR structure, new clinical  		processes need to be designed to utilize the EHR functional structure. These  		EHR-mediated processes should in turn lead to a specific set of better  		outcomes. Second, the distinctions among structure, process, and outcome are  		somewhat arbitrary in the model. Health care delivery is viewed as an  		interconnected series of structure--process--outcome relationships. For  		example, in a primary care clinic of three physicians (structure 1), a patient  		may have an electrocardiogram performed (process 1), which shows an abnormality  		(outcome 1). This abnormal result necessitates a referral to a cardiologist  		(structure 1) who orders a stress test (process 2), which comes back suggestive  		of coronary artery disease (outcome 2) and so forth. This  		structure--process--outcome chain is central to the role of EHRs in quality,  		because an EHR is a tool that explicitly links the three. An EHR with decision  		support for diabetes management (structure) allows a physician to order a  		hemoglobin A1C (process) and check the results (outcome). Because this outcome  		is stored in the EHR database, it in turn becomes part of the structure of  		care. The EHR can allow or even remind the physicians to act on that result  		(process 2), e.g., modify the patient's insulin dose, which will, in turn, lead  		to a lowering of the patient's blood sugar (outcome 3) or a reduction in the  		likelihood of a long-term diabetic complication. </p>
<p>In addition to imposing the Donabedian Structure--Process--Outcome  		model, we organized deficits in quality by means of a conceptual framework that  		divides quality problems into three types: (1) the underuse of appropriate  		health services, (2) the misuse or inappropriate use of health services, and  		(3) the overuse of health services.<sup><font><a href="#ref36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Analysis </b></p>
<p>Seven research studies were identified using the search criteria  		outlined earlier.<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>, <a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref48">48</a>,  		<a href="#ref49">49</a>, <a href="#ref50">50</a>, <a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> Four of the seven were conducted at academic  		medical centers,<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>, <a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> and three of those four were conducted at a  		single institution, Regenstrief Institute (the fourth was conducted at Beth  		Israel Hospital in Boston).<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>,  		<a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> Two studies were  		conducted at a large, integrated healthcare delivery network, Kaiser,<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a>, <a href="#ref49">49</a></font></sup> and one  		was conducted in the Netherlands.<sup><font><a href="#ref50">50</a></font></sup> All four studies from the academic medical  		centers assessed internally developed HIT systems, rather than a commercially  		available system. One study<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a></font></sup> assessed two different systems at two sites,  		one of which was internally developed by the organization and the other a  		commercially developed product. </p>
<p>All studies included data on structural quality. These varied highly and  		were largely qualitative in nature. In particular, reporting on the  		organizational and workflow changes needed to implement an EHR or a new EHR  		functionality was limited. All seven studies analyzed quality with respect to  		process of care. Six of the seven<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>,  		<a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref48">48</a>,  		<a href="#ref49">49</a>, <a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> assessed quality  		with respect to some type of outcome. </p>
<p>In terms of the types of problems the interventions were trying to  		address, six of the seven<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>,  		<a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref48">48</a>,  		<a href="#ref49">49</a>, <a href="#ref50">50</a></font></sup> included data on  		the effects of EHRs on decreasing overused or redundantly used healthcare  		services. Two<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a>, <a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> included measures of the effects of EHRs on  		appropriate but underused care. None used explicit methods to evaluate the  		impact of EHRs on inappropriate use of care. </p>
<p><b>EHR Systems in Use at Regenstrief </b></p>
<p><i>Structure. </i>Three studies that met our criteria were conducted at  		the Regenstrief Institute, which includes a research institute and an  		ambulatory care practice affiliated with both a university medical school and a  		large public hospital.<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>,  		<a href="#ref46">46</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a> </font></sup></p>
<p>The development of the EHR at the Institute began in the mid-1970s.  		Subsequent system enhancement and implementation broadened its functionality  		and scope of use. In 1984, CPOE was added to the EHR capabilities and became  		uniformly used in the outpatient setting. In the three studies covered in this  		analysis, the system included electronic documentation, results management,  		CPOE, and decision support. </p>
<p>All three studies examined the effects of incorporating new information  		elements into the process used by physicians to order diagnostic tests. Each  		involved the integration of EHR-stored data into physician decisionmaking at  		the point of care. </p>
<p>The first paper<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a></font></sup>  		reported on the effect of a structural change in care delivery: the addition of  		diagnostic test cost data to the EHR order function. Thus, physician workflow  		was altered through the inclusion of cost data in the order entry process, to  		be shown at the point of care. After physicians ordered tests, the charges for  		each test and the total charges for all tests were provided automatically in a  		new window. Physicians were then offered the option to cancel any or all tests.  		</p>
<p>This study used a complex randomized design to test the effect of the  		intervention. First, baseline utilization data were collected during a 14-week  		observation period. Second, physicians were randomized either to receive the  		cost data during order entry or to use the usual EHR functional interface where  		no cost data were provided. Finally, data collection continued for a 19-week  		post-intervention period. </p>
<p>The second paper reported on the effect of an intervention<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> in which the investigators  		created statistical models to predict the likelihood of abnormal results for  		commonly ordered diagnostic tests. These pretest probabilities were displayed  		to physicians immediately prior to test ordering. Data needed for the models  		were obtained through EHR mediated prompts to physicians and from  		patient-specific data already electronically stored. Physician workflow was  		altered by the need to enter data during the test-ordering process and by the  		incorporation of the pretest probability into their decisionmaking process. The  		number of data prompts given to physicians was not reported. </p>
<p>The study used a randomized design in which patients were the unit of  		randomization. The EHR sorted patients automatically by the predetermined  		allocation. When physicians cared for intervention patients, the pretest  		probability function was activated during the electronic ordering process. When  		physicians ordered tests for the control patients, no additional decision  		support was provided. </p>
<p>The third paper reported on an intervention<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> in which care delivery was modified through  		an intervention in which past diagnostic test results were automatically  		displayed as physicians ordered new tests. The last three results for a test,  		the time interval between tests, and the total number of times the test had  		been ordered for the patient were displayed at the point of care. No additional  		data entry was required of physicians. Physician workflow was altered by the  		need to incorporate past test results during decisionmaking. </p>
<p>The study used a complex multiphased, randomized design. First, during a  		13-week pre-intervention period, baseline data were collected regarding  		physician test ordering patterns. During the 16-week intervention period,  		patients were the unit of randomization. Finally, test ordering was monitored  		during an 8-week post-intervention period. </p>
<p><i>Process. </i>Each of these studies examined the impact of the  		EHR-related structural improvements described previously on physician  		diagnostic test ordering practices. In each study, the EHR-based intervention  		decreased the number of diagnostic tests ordered by physicians, suggesting that  		quality of care was improved through the decrease in overused health services.  		</p>
<p>The first study,<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a></font></sup> in which test charge data was displayed,  		showed an overall 14-percent decrease in the number of tests ordered by  		physicians per visit in the intervention group. Decreases were observed for  		both scheduled and for unscheduled visits. The multiphase design allowed  		additional conclusions to be made regarding the importance of maintaining the  		decision-support element as part of the structure of care. In the  		pre-intervention period, no differences in test ordering were noted. During the  		intervention period, physicians randomized to the decision support tool ordered  		17 percent fewer tests. In the post-intervention period, after the decision  		support was removed from the EHR, physicians who had been in the intervention  		group ordered only 7 percent fewer tests than during baseline. This effect  		decrement suggests that the knowledge of costs the test physicians gained  		during the intervention was not sufficient to alter practice over time.  		Instead, it was the presence of the additional cost information within the  		structure of care that most affected performance. </p>
<p>The second study,<sup><font><a href="#ref46">46</a></font></sup> in which abnormal test result probabilities  		were displayed to providers, showed a 9 percent overall decrease in the number  		of tests ordered by physicians. Two tests, urinalysis and urine culture, which  		had been underused prior to the intervention, showed increases in ordering  		frequency (+14 percent and +27). However, for the other six, overused tests  		examined, decreases ranged from 4 percent (electrocardiogram) to 14 percent  		(chest x-ray). These findings suggest that providing point-of-care pretest  		probabilities via an EHR improves the quality of care processes by decreasing  		overused testing and by increasing the use of previously underused care. </p>
<p>The third study,<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> in which past abnormal test results were  		displayed, showed an overall 9decrease in the number of tests ordered by  		physicians. As in the first study, data were analyzed in the post-intervention  		period to assess the persistence of the effect. After the EHR intervention was  		discontinued, the researchers observed a non-statistically significant  		11-percent increase in the number of tests ordered (the post-intervention  		period time frame was not long enough for this trend to reach statistical  		significance). </p>
<p><i>Outcomes. </i>In the first study,<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a></font></sup> the primary outcome was diagnostic  		test-related charges. Charges were 13 percent ($6.68 in 1988 dollars) lower per  		visit for the intervention group physicians than for the control group.  		Decreases in charges were directly due to the decrease in the number of tests  		ordered, i.e., the improvements in quality of care processes. Given the  		likelihood that the intervention reduced overused care, this outcome increases  		the efficiency of care delivery. </p>
<p>In the second study,<sup><font><a href="#ref46">46</a></font></sup> which used statistical models to predict  		whether any of eight commonly ordered diagnostic tests were likely to be  		abnormal, the primary outcome was financial charges for tests. Overall, charges  		decreased 9 percent ($1.09 in 1986 dollars). A technical outcome of the study  		was the operating characteristics of the statistical models used to predict lab  		test abnormalities, which were based on data collected and stored in the EHR.  		All predictive models for the study tests performed well, with receiver  		operating curve areas generally over 0.75 (range 0.66 to 0.92). </p>
<p>In the third study,<sup><font><a href="#ref47">47</a></font></sup> efficiency outcomes were also observed due to  		the decrease in the number of tests ordered. Charges for tests in the  		intervention group were 13 percent lower per visit (approximately $1.82 per  		visit in 1986 dollars). </p>
<p><b>EHR Systems in Use at Kaiser Permanente </b></p>
<p><i>Structure.</i> Two studies came from regional medical centers in the  		Kaiser Permanente network, an integrated, not-for-profit, nonacademic  		healthcare delivery system. </p>
<p>In the first of these two studies,<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a></font></sup> comprehensive EHRs were implemented in two  		regions (Northwest and Colorado) of the enterprise. One EHR was internally  		developed (Colorado) and the other externally developed by a commercial vendor  		(Northwest). Although the EHR systems were different, both were reported to  		have comparable functionality, including the following: documentation, clinical  		results management, CPOE for both diagnostics and medications, administrative  		data management, and decision support. Specific decision support functions  		varied between the two sites in both content and scope. </p>
<p>The second of these two studies provided a brief qualitative description  		of structural changes associated with and supporting EHR implementation.  		Implementation was carried out gradually, in phases, beginning in discrete  		areas of the ambulatory care clinics. The majority of system implementation was  		completed within one year of initiation. The authors note that because of  		phased implementation, it was "some time" before changes in health care  		delivery were noted. (Data related to time course of impact will be discussed  		in the Outcomes section of this analysis.) No data on the specific  		organizational drivers for adoption were included. </p>
<p>Structural reorganization and improvements in workflow were described  		briefly. Prior to the implementation of EHR in each region, the presence of  		multiple ambulatory sites required paper records to be physically delivered.  		Paper charts were warehoused and had to be delivered "several miles." For  		same-day and unscheduled ambulatory visits, availability of paper records was  		"unreliable." After EHR implementation, use of paper charts was "essentially  		eliminated" and electronic patient charts became available for emergency room  		visits, unscheduled visits, and same-day appointments. Charts also became  		available for telephone contacts, and the resulting improvement in clinical  		workflow led to more effective utilization of telephone-based care, with  		physicians reporting that they were better able to address patient health  		issues over the phone when provided with access to electronic records. The  		authors cite this outcome as a primary reason for decreased office visits, one  		of the primary outcomes of the study. </p>
<p>In terms of time frame of impacts, little difference in services was  		noted during the first year of implementation (the authors reported system  		implementation was mostly completed one year after implementation began). </p>
<p>Evaluating the effects of EHR adoption was itself a form of structural  		change in this study. In order to determine appropriate utilization measures to  		assess the effect of EHR implementation, interviews were conducted with 100  		individuals with a broad array of organizational roles. Interviews led the  		investigators to hypothesize that ambulatory care delivery had become more  		efficient by making needed information available during the initial episode of  		care, thus decreasing the need for follow-up visits and redundant services.  		Interviews also suggested that quality had improved. These hypotheses formed  		the basis for the selection of metrics and the quantitative evaluation done in  		the study (discussed in the Process and Outcome section of this analysis). No  		further details were provided regarding the data acquired from these interviews  		or the methodology used to conduct them. </p>
<p>The study design was a retrospective time-series analysis with data  		analyzed at one-year intervals before and after implementation. Baseline data  		were used from the three years prior to implementation. For the Kaiser  		Northwest site, four years of post-implementation data were available, whereas  		for Colorado, only two years of post-implementation data were available because  		of later implementation. </p>
<p>The second of the two studies, conducted in the Kaiser Northwest  		system,<sup><font><a href="#ref49">49</a></font></sup> examined the  		incorporation of guidelines through the EHR to support the decisionmaking  		process for ordering radiology tests and medications. The two-phase  		implementation process was described briefly. In the first, a read-only results  		reporting system that integrated data from departmental systems was  		implemented. In the second phase, the commercially developed EHR described  		above for the first Kaiser study was implemented. Together, both phases took  		approximately three years to complete. Per the authors, attempts were made to  		present guidelines to providers as efficiency aids that would streamline their  		workflow; the electronic guidelines were kept simple and integrated smoothly  		into existing procedures. Provider adherence to guidelines was not mandated;  		however, the electronic ordering system was designed to make adherence simple,  		and the guidelines were presented in text form without requiring explicit  		interaction. No further specific implementation-related information was  		provided in the paper for either the EHR or the guideline tools. </p>
<p>The study design was a time-series analysis that examined utilization  		patterns at multiple time points before and after guideline implementation.  		</p>
<p><i>Process. </i>The first Kaiser study,<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a></font></sup> which examined the effects of EHR  		implementation at two sites in the Kaiser network, examined multiple processes  		of care. </p>
<p>Three quality indicators from the Health Plan Employer and Data  		Information Set (HEDIS) were chosen to assess quality. These items were chosen  		in part because their definitions remained consistent over the time period of  		the analysis. Each was a process-of-care measure: advice on smoking cessation,  		cervical cancer screening, and retinal eye examination. No statistically  		significant differences were found in performance on these process measures  		from the pre- to the post-implementation period. </p>
<p>However, multiple utilization-related processes were examined and showed  		considerable change after EHR implementation. In general, they suggest  		improvements in quality of care through a decrease in redundant health  		services. Age-adjusted rates of radiology test utilization decreased overall by  		4 percent after EHR implementation. The authors note that over this same  		period, radiology service use increased within the Kaiser system as a whole and  		nationally as well (quantitative data not provided for either increase).  		Laboratory test utilization in one site decreased 18 percent four years  		post-implementation. However, utilization rates subsequently increased 5 to 7  		percent annually. In the other site, the rate of laboratory test utilization  		had risen 14 percent prior to EHR implementation, but decreased by 3 percent  		over the two post-implementation years included in this study. Comparisons of  		laboratory utilization with other non-EHR sites in the network were not  		included in the analysis. The number of telephone encounters physicians  		scheduled with patients increased substantially after EHR implementation,  		rising from 1.3 telephone encounters per member per year to 2.1 telephone  		encounters per year. Per the authors, physicians qualitatively reported that  		telephone encounters were more effective because their capacity to resolve  		patient issues was enhanced by accessing the EHR. </p>
<p>The second Kaiser study<sup><font><a href="#ref49">49</a></font></sup> focused on processes of care-related  		adherence for two radiology tests and on formulary adherence for one  		medication, after guidelines were incorporated into the EHR. </p>
<p>Use of upper gastro intestinal (UGI) radiology testing decreased from 11  		UGI per thousand members to 6 UGI per thousand members after guideline  		implementation (40-percent relative decrease). The number of chest x-rays  		ordered also decreased 20 percent. Prescription of a nonformulary medication  		for depression decreased from 4.7 percent of all selective serotonin reuptake  		inhibitors (SSRIs) to 2.4 percent (SSRIs are the most widely used class of  		medications for depression and multiple agents are available for prescription  		in this class). Noted effects were sustained over time. The analysis made no  		attempt to control for other factors that may have affected utilization of  		radiology testing or formulary adherence. </p>
<p><i>Outcome. </i>Outcomes in the first Kaiser study related to efficiency  		and utilization.<sup><font><a href="#ref48">48</a></font></sup> The  		age-adjusted total office visits decreased by 9 percent in year 2 after initial  		implementation. Primary care visits decreased by 11 percent and specialty care  		visits decreased by approximately 5 percent, both of which were statistically  		significant. Reductions in visits held across patient cohorts, including those  		with the greatest baseline rates of visits. The number of patients making three  		or more visits decreased by approximately 10 percent between year 1 and year 2  		post-implementation in the Northwest region and by 11 percent in Colorado. In  		year 4, a further decrease of 2 percent was noted in the Northwest region. No  		comment was made on whether these decreases in the high-volume use category  		were statistically significant. Direct comparisons with utilization at non-EHR  		sites were not possible because of inconsistent definitions of office visits.  		However, in three other network regions (all of which used independent  		definitions of a visit) for which visit utilization data were available for the  		same time period, no similar decreases were noted. </p>
<p>In terms of the statistical analysis, no strict control variables were  		included in the analysis. The following structural measures were reviewed  		separately to examine possible confounding: rates of ER visits, ratio of  		primary care providers to members, ratio of referrals to outside providers. Per  		the authors report, none changed significantly over the study time frame. </p>
<p>Appointments made for patients after doctor-managed telephone encounters  		decreased by 7 percent after the EHRs were implemented. However, when telephone  		contacts reverted to nurses, these appointments "rose" (no quantitative data  		provided). </p>
<p><b>EHR Systems in Use in the Netherlands </b></p>
<p><i>Structure</i>. A single report details a large multisite study in the  		Netherlands in which the effects of two different types of EHR laboratory test  		order interfaces were examined.<sup><font><a href="#ref50">50</a></font></sup> Both sought to decrease the number of  		laboratory tests ordered by providers by presenting a limited set of tests on  		the primary laboratory order screen in the EHR. While all available tests in a  		laboratory system cannot usually be presented at once on a computer screen,  		these interventions did not allow screen size or human factor constraints to  		dictate which test options were initially made available to providers. Instead,  		they presented considerably smaller sets of choices. Thus, both interfaces  		changed provider workflow considerably when compared to paper or to  		nonrestrictive EHR order interfaces. Although providers could order any tests  		they wanted, any test not explicitly present on the EHR laboratory screen  		required additional search time to find and call up. </p>
<p>In one experimental condition, statistical probability was used to  		select the fifteen most commonly ordered tests overall to present to a provider  		on the initial order interface. In the other condition, the tests presented to  		providers depended on the patient's specific diagnosis. Diagnosis-specific  		tests were presented electronically, based on recommendations from existing  		guidelines. This intervention altered provider workflow to a greater extent  		than did the first intervention. First, a menu of guidelines/indications was  		presented, from which the provider had to select those most relevant to the  		patient's conditions. Based on the indications for testing entered by the  		provider, the EHR picked the most relevant to present as possible options for  		ordering. The guideline set was not comprehensive for all possible tests, and  		all possible indications for a test were not included in the electronic  		guidelines. Physicians could override recommended tests and order  		nonrecommended tests at their discretion by entering, "other indication." </p>
<p>All physician practices in the sample were already using EHRs at the  		time of the proposed laboratory-ordering intervention. However, prior to the  		intervention, lab tests were ordered through structured paper-based order  		forms. All practices in the region using EHRs were offered the opportunity to  		participate in the experiment and add one of the electronic lab ordering  		functionalities to their systems. Of 64 practices, 46 (72 percent) agreed.  		Sixty-two general practitioners worked at those 46 sites. A three-month  		implementation period was included to familiarize the physicians with the  		software. Over the course of the study, four practitioners withdrew: one solo  		practitioner withdrew because the software decreased the performance of his  		computer, another withdrew because of dissatisfaction with the system, and two  		other physicians in the same practice withdrew for unspecified reasons. Thus,  		complete data were available for 44 practices, representing 60 physicians. </p>
<p>Physicians were still left with the option of using paper order forms  		during the study. In the non-guideline specified cohort, 88 percent of all  		orders were entered through the software. In the guideline-based electronic  		order cohort, 71 percent of all tests were ordered through the software. Final  		data analysis included total lab tests ordered both electronically and through  		paper forms. </p>
<p><i>Process. </i>This study<sup><font><a href="#ref50">50</a></font></sup> focused primarily on process change:  		examining the effect of changes in information presentation on test ordering.  		Physicians randomized to the guideline-based interface ordered 1.4 percent  		fewer lab tests (5.5 vs. 6.9) than did physicians presented with the list of  		most commonly ordered tests. This difference translated into a relative  		decrease of 20 percent in tests ordered. The 20 most commonly ordered tests  		accounted for 80 percent of all tests. No data on human factors issues or  		usability were reported. Such data may have been informative, given the  		different workflows created by each intervention. Further supporting the  		potential utility of such data are the different rates of use for each software  		package (in the guideline cohort, 71 percent of all tests were ordered through  		the software and 29 percent through paper; in the other cohort, 88 percent of  		all tests were ordered through the software and the remaining 12 percent  		through paper). </p>
<p><i>Outcomes. </i>No outcomes were reported for this study.<sup><font><a href="#ref50">50</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>EHR Systems in Use at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston  		MA) </b></p>
<p><i>Structure. </i>The last EHR study was conducted at the ambulatory  		care medicine practice at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston,  		an academic medical center.<sup><font><a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> Development of their clinical computing  		system began in the 1970s and was internal. System functionality at the time of  		the study included documentation, results management, order entry, decision  		support administrative data management, and electronic communication through  		email. Electronic documentation and results management capabilities were  		available through the Internet. </p>
<p>The goal of the study, which began in 1990, was to improve quality of  		outpatient HIV care by incorporating guideline-based alerts and alarms into the  		system. At the time of the study, no national consensus guideline on HIV care  		existed. Thus, as a first step, a set of guidelines was developed internally by  		a panel of local experts. The guidelines were then automated and incorporated  		into the EHR. </p>
<p>The alerts and alarms created new provider workflows when compared to a  		paper-based system. Decision support was given to providers on-line and without  		provider prompting. Clinicians were given the opportunity to act on the alerts  		and reminders as they appeared, by sending electronic messages for orders to be  		executed. The system also allowed providers to decline recommendations; and  		space was included in the EHR to document the reason. The workflow for each of  		those options differed. Alerts popped up each time a provider logged on,  		regardless of the patient being seen or reason for accessing the system.  		Reminders were shown only at the time of the patient visit. This study, which  		was conducted over 18 months (from 1992 to 1993), used a controlled clinical  		trial design. Five practice sites were involved. Coin flips were used to assign  		practices to the intervention or the control condition. All clinicians at a  		site were assigned to the same condition over the course of the study. The  		total sample included 22 providers. </p>
<p><i>Process. </i>The purpose of this study<sup><font><a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> was to assess the effects on processes of  		care of incorporating electronic guidelines for outpatient HIV care into the  		EHR. One year after implementation of the EHR guidelines, the number of  		eligible patients receiving recommended HIV care in the alerts intervention  		group was 85 percent vs. 64 percent in the control group. At three months  		post-implementation enhanced utilization of appropriate services was noted for  		all measures, including ordering CD4 counts (82 percent vs. 60 percent),  		starting AZT or DDI when appropriate (86 percent vs. 65 percent), modifying AZT  		dose (76 percent vs. 62 percent), PCP prophylaxis (88 percent vs. 42 percent),  		and complete blood counts (89 percent vs. 65 percent). All findings were  		statistically significant to a p value of 0.05 except for starting AZT/DDI or  		changing the AZT dose. The median response time for a provider to order  		appropriate services in response to new clinical information was 11 days in the  		intervention group and 52 days in the control group. </p>
<p>At one year, the number of eligible patients receiving recommended HIV  		care in the reminders intervention group was significantly greater than in the  		control group (68 percent versus 46 percent). Processes of care examined  		included pneumovax receipt (82 percent vs. 38 percent), TB skin testing (78  		percent vs. 62 percent), H. influenza vaccination (41 percent vs. 25 percent),  		tetanus vaccination (31 percent vs. 17 percent), and referrals to ophthalmology  		(75 percent vs. 46 percent) (p values were less than 0.05 for all results  		except TB testing, for which p=0.07 and tetanus vaccination, for which p=0.1).  		At one year, toxoplasmosis titers were drawn on an equivalent percent of  		patients (82 percent vs. 81 percent). However, the median response time in the  		intervention group was 8 days vs. 168 days for the control group. No  		differences in cervical cancer screening were noted. In the intervention group,  		the median time for a provider to act on clinical information to order  		appropriate services was 114 days vs. more than 500 days in the control group.  		</p>
<p>In the intervention patient cohort, 303 alerts and 432 reminders were  		generated and sent to clinicians. In the control group, 388 alerts and 360  		reminders would have been sent to providers. </p>
<p><i>Outcome. </i>This study<sup><font><a href="#ref51">51</a></font></sup> examined rates of visits to primary care,  		rates of hospitalizations, visits to emergency rooms or walk-in clinics. No  		statistically significant differences were observed. Rates of pneumocystic  		disease and one-year mortality also showed no differences. </p>
<p><b>Conclusions </b></p>
<p>The studies reviewed in this analysis illustrate a range of ways in  		which ambulatory EHRs can serve to improve quality of care. In particular, they  		demonstrate how provider performance can be improved when the clinical  		information management and decision support tools are available within an EHR  		system. A recurrent theme in these studies was the capacity of EHRs to store  		data with high fidelity, to make those data readily accessible, and to help  		translate them into context-specific information that can empower providers in  		their work. </p>
<p>This analysis is limited by a number of factors. The small number of  		studies included in the sample was largely a function of the search criteria.  		In particular, few systems with the core EHR functionalities of documentation,  		results management, provider order entry, and decision support have been  		examined, particularly for commercially developed products. These functional  		criteria were chosen to make the analysis more pertinent to decisionmakers  		currently considering EHR adoption. Because of the rapid technical advances in  		EHR, many of the studies of EHR systems are out of date. This review has  		focused on EHRs with these core functionalities in order to provide  		decisionmakers with an overview of the evidence that is most likely to be  		pertinent to the choices they are making now. Another major limitation is the  		lack of description (and data) pertaining to the workflow reengineering and  		organizational change that were required for EHR use. As discussed earlier, the  		"intervention" in these studies is not only the EHR system but also the manner  		in which these systems change the way healthcare professionals work,  		organizations function, and consumers receive care. This information is highly  		context-specific, and for the findings of research on EHRs to be more widely  		generalizable, this part of the "intervention" needs to be characterized,  		described, and measured more accurately and comprehensibly. Without such  		process implementation data, the applicability of findings from one context to  		another will be a barrier to informed decisionmaking. </p>
<h3>Economic Value of an Electronic Health Record Systems  		and Health Information Technology Applications</h3>
<p>Consumers of the healthcare system, including government in the United  		States, employers, and patients, are demanding higher quality, safety,  		consistency, efficiency, and value. In order to meet these demands,  		interoperable computerized health information technology, especially an EHR  		system that documents patient care processes and outcomes across the continuum  		of care, is widely believed to be a critical tool. Ideal use of an EHR system  		enables improved capture and integration of patient information from diverse  		sources and allows clinicians to access longitudinal patient-specific  		information for clinical decisionmaking and disease management. Other commonly  		used terms referring to aspects of an EHR system include personal health record  		and electronic medical records. In this review, EHR refers to a HIT element  		that performs the functions of electronic recording, storage, accessing, and  		viewing of patient medical information.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a>,  		<a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> An EHR system is a computer application  		with EHR functionality at minimum. Often, financial data are also included in  		such a system. Since the system is designed to be used institution-wide to  		replace paper-based medical records and to aid the efficiency of healthcare  		processes, many EHR applications also contain other system functions, including  		prescription and test ordering, care management reminders, and other clinical  		decision-support capabilities. While the EHR is considered essential technology  		for improving efficiency and quality of health care, implementation of an EHR  		system requires substantial capital investments and organizational change.  		Consequently, many health care organizations are seeking evidence and lessons  		learned about the costs and benefits of EHR adoption in order to better inform  		decisions about the timing and strategy for implementation. </p>
<p>EHR is the second most common HIT element among the articles identified  		that contain economic data. Our literature search identified 92  		hypothesis-testing or predictive analysis articles containing information on  		costs, utilization, or efficiency. Of these, 32 studies assessed a HIT system  		in which EHR was one of the major system elements. However, only nine articles  		quantitatively assessed the economic value of an EHR system as a whole. We  		discuss these articles in further detail below. Most of the remaining studies  		were tests of certain nonfinancial hypotheses or examination of a subset of  		functionality, such as decision support, instead of the entire EHR system.  		Although these studies do not assess the costs and benefits of the entire  		system, they provide indirect, often empirical, evidence that can support the  		economic appraisal of the value of an EHR system. Before we begin the review of  		the nine articles, we first summarize the main findings of the remaining  		studies. Interested readers are referred to our interactive evidence database  		to learn more about these studies (<a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand">http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand</a>). </p>
<p><b>Summary of Key Findings from Non-Financially Focused Studies </b></p>
<p>Among its other functions, an EHR system can facilitate automatic  		generation of patient reminders for preventive services, screening, and disease  		management. Five Canadian studies used the same EHR system to generate patient  		reminders and compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three  		strategies--physician reminders, telephone reminders, or letter reminders--to  		remind patients to get preventive services.<sup><font><a href="#ref56">56</a>, <a href="#ref57">57</a>, <a href="#ref58">58</a>,  		<a href="#ref59">59</a>, <a href="#ref60">60</a></font></sup> All forms of  		reminders were effective, with reminders delivered directly to patients being  		somewhat more effective than reminders to physicians. Another study used  		computerized pharmacy records to generate patient feedback and compared the  		effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two depression care programs.<sup><font><a href="#ref61">61</a></font></sup> Feedback with care management  		was significantly better than feedback alone. </p>
<p>Electronic charting is a feature of EHR that has been reported to affect  		provider productivity.<sup><font><a href="#ref62">62</a>,  		<a href="#ref63">63</a>, <a href="#ref64">64</a>, <a href="#ref65">65</a></font></sup> These studies found that the time needed for  		development of care plans and documentation initially increased, but  		preparation time decreased subsequently. The initial loss of productivity was  		associated with the baseline computer skills of the users (clinicians). Two  		studies assessed computerized documentation systems used for the ICU.<sup><font><a href="#ref66">66</a>, <a href="#ref67">67</a></font></sup> The  		authors of the first study asserted that addition of their computer-based  		nursing documentation required no specific ICU software or bedside workstations  		because it was implemented in a well-networked information technology  		environment.<sup><font><a href="#ref66">66</a></font></sup> Thus,  		they found that compared with paper charting, their electronic charting system  		was relatively inexpensive (although the figures were not provided). In  		addition, the documentation was more complete because of the presence of  		reminders for missing entries, and data quality remarkably improved. The other  		study used work sampling and cost analysis methodologies to show net savings of  		a vendor-developed bedside documentation system specifically designed for an  		ICU.<sup><font><a href="#ref67">67</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another potential benefit of EHR systems is avoidance of morbidity  		because of improved patient safety. One study of ADEs found that building ADE  		detection and reporting capability into EHR can improve detection and potential  		reduction of ADE in hospital settings because of the ability of the EHR system  		to easily identify and confirm patients experiencing ADEs and thus enabled  		early intervention.<sup><font><a href="#ref68">68</a></font></sup>  		Several studies have shown that severe ADEs were associated with longer  		hospitalizations and higher hospitalization costs (over $2,000 in 2005  		dollars).<sup><font><a href="#ref68">68</a>, <a href="#ref69">69</a>,  		<a href="#ref70">70</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Several studies investigated the impact of point-of-care alerts and  		reminders imbedded within an EHR system during the process of documentation or  		entry of orders into the system.<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>,  		<a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref71">71</a>, <a href="#ref72">72</a>,  		<a href="#ref73">73</a>, <a href="#ref74">74</a>, <a href="#ref75">75</a>,  		<a href="#ref76">76</a></font></sup> These decision-support functions within an  		EHR system, when accompanied by the required changes in process and  		communication, altered physicians' ordering behaviors by facilitating  		appropriate resource utilization and reducing unnecessary charges.<sup><font><a href="#ref45">45</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a>, <a href="#ref71">71</a>, <a href="#ref72">72</a>, <a href="#ref73">73</a>,  		<a href="#ref74">74</a>, <a href="#ref75">75</a>, <a href="#ref76">76</a></font></sup> For example, one study estimated that  		reducing the ordering of redundant clinical laboratory tests could produce an  		annual savings of $35,000 in laboratory charges.<sup><font><a href="#ref72">72</a></font></sup> A randomized controlled trial that tested the  		effect of immediately printed summaries of a computerized medical record on  		physician test ordering rates in an emergency room setting<sup><font><a href="#ref77">77</a></font></sup> showed significant improvement  		in the cost-effectiveness of internists' ordering behaviors. The impact on  		surgeons' ordering patterns was positive but not significant. </p>
<p>Some EHR systems offer sophisticated CPOE and decision-support  		functionality. A randomized controlled trial found positive effects of an EHR  		with integrated CPOE on resource utilization, provider productivity, and care  		efficiency.<sup><font><a href="#ref78">78</a></font></sup> Two  		additional studies showed that an EHR with integrated decision support helped  		providers improve the quality of documentation, clinical decisionmaking, and  		guideline compliance, and resulted in reduced utilization of services and costs  		of care.<sup><font><a href="#ref76">76</a>, <a href="#ref76">79</a></font></sup> However, another study found that  		implementation of clinical guidelines via an EHR had no significant effect on  		clinical outcomes or healthcare costs.<sup><font><a href="#ref30">30</a></font></sup> The benefits of information technology seem  		to depend greatly on the quality of the implementation and the level and type  		of decision-support technology. </p>
<p><b>Analytic Methods to Assess the Economic Value of an EHR System  		</b></p>
<p>This section provides a more detailed review of the nine articles that  		quantitatively assessed the economic value of an EHR system, including  		summaries of the analytic methods used in the studies. Two articles by the same  		author described the same ambulatory EHR system, although the economic  		estimates differ slightly between articles.<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> Therefore, we refer  		to them as one study described in two articles. Of the remaining seven  		articles, four report on evaluations of the economics of an EHR system: two in  		the ambulatory care setting<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> and two in an integrated delivery network  		(IDN) (an IDN comprises providers--both inpatient and outpatient--as well as  		payers and purchasers, in one connected managed care organization).<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> Another  		study concerns health care information exchange and interoperability,<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> and the remaining two are  		methodological papers.<sup><font><a href="#ref83">83</a>,  		<a href="#ref84">84</a></font></sup> A brief summary of the methods and  		findings of these studies is presented in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. </p>
<p>To assess the value of EHR, one methodological paper described a  		return-on-investment framework to evaluate the costs and benefits of  		implementing an ambulatory EHR system, and another presented a spreadsheet tool  		to help family physicians estimate the costs of implementing an EHR system.  		Both reports provided illustrative examples. Of the remaining six studies, five  		used cost-benefit analysis<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a>, <a href="#ref55">55</a>,  		<a href="#ref81">81</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> and one used  		cost-consequence analysis.<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> All the cost-benefit analyses adopted the ROI  		framework, which assesses the difference between the costs of an EHR investment  		and the benefits reaped from it. In these studies, both costs and benefits are  		quantified in monetary terms to the extent the authors determined was feasible.  		For example, one study aimed to justify the cost of EHR by first identifying  		the goals of the system in order to determine benefits.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> To quantify benefits, the authors then  		performed an extensive literature review, surveyed other institutions that were  		implementing EHR, interviewed EHR vendors, and conducted process-mapping  		sessions to identify potential cost savings on work processes affected by EHR.  		However, cost estimation was based largely on vendor response to a request for  		information or on current information system costs in the healthcare  		organization.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> The cost-consequence study showed costs in  		monetary terms but did not quantify the benefits of EHR except for time saved  		from chart pulling.<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup>  		All studies except two used the perspective of an organization, either  		outpatient settings<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a>, <a href="#ref83">83</a>,  		<a href="#ref84">84</a></font></sup> or IDN.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> Of the other two  		studies, one adopted a societal perspective,<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> and the other used multiple perspectives,  		from organization level to national level.<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Six studies reported their data sources.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref80">80</a>,  		<a href="#ref81">81</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a>, <a href="#ref83">83</a></font></sup> All used multiple data sources, including  		primary data collected from an existing EHR system,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> published data,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a>, <a href="#ref83">83</a></font></sup> workplace and  		demonstration site observations,<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a>,  		<a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> and surveys or interviews of key  		informants or EHR users. <sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>,  		<a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> Experts were a primary source of data for  		some studies,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> as were  		vendors.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> One study also used process-mapping  		sessions.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Cost and benefit variables used in each study are listed in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. The cost variables included in most studies  		included hardware and network acquisition, software licensing, ongoing  		technical support and maintenance, and training and other implementation costs.  		Costs associated with temporary productivity loss due to the EHR implementation  		were captured by two studies,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> but a third study assumed no cost  		associated with loss of productivity, given a long-term EHR implementation  		strategy.<sup><font><a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> Other cost  		variables include installation (which was not quantified in greater  		detail),<sup><font><a href="#ref83">83</a></font></sup> data  		entry,<sup><font><a href="#ref84">84</a></font></sup>  		printing,<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> system integration in IDN setting,<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> personnel,<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> and  		institutional and project management.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> The health care  		information exchange and interoperability study also included interface  		development cost. </p>
<p>The benefit variables included the following: savings from chart pull  		and transcription;<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref80">80</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a>,  		<a href="#ref83">83</a></font> </sup>time saved to document diagnostic  		codes;<sup><font><a href="#ref81">81</a>, <a href="#ref83">83</a></font></sup> prevention of ADEs;<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> reduction in drug<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font> </sup>  		laboratory,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> or radiology costs;<sup><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></sup> improvement of charge  		capture;<sup><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></sup> decreased  		billing errors;<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup>  		personnel and space savings from reduced existing and future medical record  		storage requirements;<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>,  		<a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> as well as automated generation of  		clinical forms,<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> pharmacy information,<sup><font><a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> and billing data generation.<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> One  		study provided a comprehensive list of potential benefits grouped into four  		categories: data capture and access, decision support, business management, and  		streamlining patient flow.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> The health care information exchange and  		interoperability study reported quantifiable benefits from health information  		connectivity for providers, payers, and other stakeholders, including radiology  		centers, laboratories, pharmacies, and public health departments.<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> Three studies showed the net  		ROI.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a></font> </sup></p>
<p>Various analytic designs were used, although the reference strategy was  		always the traditional paper-based medical record. One study assessed the  		economic value of an EHR system concurrently with its implementation and  		reported the first-year economic consequences of the system.<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> Another study predicted a fixed  		annual savings and expenses based on seven years of EHR implementation  		experiences in a HMO.<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>,  		<a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> Yet another study constructed a  		hypothetical primary care provider patient panel using average statistics from  		one of the nation's leading organizations in EHR implementation.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> Both studies of EHR systems in IDN settings  		are analytic predictions because EHR had not been implemented in the studied  		organizations.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> The health care information exchange and  		interoperability study for a fully standardized nationwide system is also an  		analytic prediction based on a conceptual framework describing how health care  		entities share information and a functional taxonomy reflecting the amount of  		human involvement required, the sophistication of IT, and the level of  		standardization.<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup>  		Sensitivity analyses were performed in three studies.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref80">80</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Evidence of Economic Costs and Benefits of an EHR System </b></p>
<p>Our interactive evidence database (<a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand">http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand</a>)  		provides a structured abstract for each of the nine identified studies  		regarding the costs and benefits of EHR. Main findings are highlighted in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> and summarized below. </p>
<p><b>Costs of Implementing an EHR System. </b>Five studies quantitatively  		assessed the costs of implementing an EHR system.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a>,  		<a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref80">80</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> The costs can be divided into two categories:  		(1) cost of the system itself (hardware, software, license, maintenance, and  		support) and (2) implementation cost (training, temporary loss of productivity,  		etc.). The costs vary significantly by the scale of the healthcare organization  		and the functionality of the EHR system. </p>
<p>(1)<i> Cost of an EHR System.</i> One study estimated the system costs  		for an ambulatory EHR to be $9,700 per provider (in 2002 dollars), which  		included $1,600 for the annual software license, $1,500 for annual support and  		maintenance, and $6,600 for hardware (three computers and network, refreshed  		every three years).<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup>  		The estimate was for a hypothetical primary care provider office and was  		modeled after a well-developed and widely used EHR system at a leading IDN  		health care system. The component parts of the EHR system include online  		patient charts, electronic prescribing, laboratory order entry, radiology order  		entry, and electronic charge capture. </p>
<p>In a Swedish primary health care setting with 50 staff, the system cost  		of a vendor-developed EHR system was estimated to be $240,000 in the first year  		(in 1995 U.S. dollars).<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> The EHR system supported full-text patient  		records and included a controlled medical terminology, a structured patient  		database, and tools for the analysis and reporting of patient data. The  		hardware at the sites comprised one server supporting approximately 40  		workstations and 20 printers. </p>
<p>In a large HMO with 13 outpatient care locations in Ohio, a homegrown  		ambulatory EHR was estimated to have had a system development cost of $10  		million (in 1996 dollars) and additional annual expenses of $630,000 (in 1996  		dollars) for printing, network expenses, memory, and license  		renewals.<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> The EHR system was used routinely by 220  		physicians and 110 allied health professionals. It implemented an encounter  		system that collected and presented such medical data elements as diagnoses,  		allergies, medications prescribed, immunizations, vital signs, and smoking  		status at the time of an encounter. The system also generated physician  		reminders for guideline compliance and patient reminders for preventive  		services and was linked to centralized clinical data on the mainframe, such as  		laboratory results, radiology reports, emergency department notes, and hospital  		discharge summaries. </p>
<p>An academic cancer center with a staff of about 8000 and facilities that  		included a hospital, outpatient clinics, and remote patient-care sites was  		interested in implementing an EHR for its IDN as both a clinical and financial  		information management tool in 1994. The cost estimates for vendor-developed  		EHR systems to meet the center's organizational needs ranged from $15.8 million  		to $21 million (in 1994 dollars), which included costs of hardware, software,  		interface development, network cost, data conversion, training, and annual  		maintenance.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup>  		Additionally, the annual support costs were estimated to range from $3.8  		million to $5.3 million. </p>
<p>A 2002 study estimated the costs of implementing an EHR<sup><font><a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> for an IDN that included a  		medical center with a 280-bed acute care hospital, 16 hospital-based and  		satellite outpatient clinics, a research institute, and a network of about 400  		employed physicians. A vendor-developed EHR was estimated to cost approximately  		$19 million (in 2001 dollars) for the seven-year implementation period. This  		included costs for the various software products, server hardware, professional  		services related to installation and training, as well as desktop devices,  		monitors, biometric security devices, imaging hardware and software, additional  		technical-support staff, and other associated costs. </p>
<p>(2)<i> Cost of the Implementation Process.</i> Only two studies provided  		an estimate of costs associated with the EHR implementation process. Both were  		for ambulatory settings.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>,  		<a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> One estimated an implementation cost of  		$3,400 per provider (in 2002 dollars) in the first year associated with  		workflow process redesign, training, and historical paper chart  		abstracting.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> It also  		estimated a revenue loss of $11,200 in the first year due to temporary loss of  		productivity. The total implementation process cost, $14,600 per provider, is  		1.5 times the estimated EHR system cost. </p>
<p>The Swedish study used a societal perspective and included costs of  		training and unexpected costs pertained to self-training during working hours,  		loss of normal activities in leisure hours, increase in administrative work  		load, extra service, and medical records summary.<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> These costs were estimated at $75,000 (in  		1995 U.S. dollars), approximately 30 percent of the EHR system cost. </p>
<p>A third study projected the costs of implementing health care  		information exchange and interoperability where EHR is a requirement for Levels  		3 and 4 implementation,<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> which, according to the authors' taxonomy,  		refers to the ability to handle machine-organizable data and  		machine-interpretable data, respectively. The authors projected costs for  		multiple stakeholders of the healthcare system for Levels 3 and 4 health care  		information exchange and interoperability. The national ten-year rollout cost  		of Levels 3 and 4 were estimated to be $320 billion and $276 billion,  		respectively. Additionally, the national ten-year annual costs were estimated  		at $20.2 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively. </p>
<p><b>Quantified Benefits from an EHR System</b>. Benefits of an EHR system  		or health care information exchange and interoperability were also quantified  		in the six studies that assessed the cost of implementing such a system. </p>
<p>One study was based on the Partners HealthCare ambulatory EHR, which not  		only provided health information and data storage capability but also possessed  		results management, order entry management, point-of-care decision support, and  		administrative information management functionalities. Therefore, many benefits  		were expected. The study divided the benefits into three categories: (1)  		payer-independent benefits, including savings from chart pulls and  		transcription; (2) benefits under capitated reimbursement, including averted  		costs from ADEs, drug utilization, laboratory utilization, and radiology  		utilization; and (3) benefits under fee-for-service reimbursement, including  		improvement in charge capture and decreased billing errors.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> The authors predicted that  		savings from chart pulls and transcription would be seen immediately after the  		EHR implementation, and costs associated with ADEs and drug utilization could  		be averted from second year on, but other potential savings would not be  		realized until the fourth year. Five-year total benefits of an EHR  		implementation were estimated to be $129,300 per provider (in 2002 dollars), or  		a net savings of $86,400 per provider (in 2002 dollars). Sensitivity analyses  		showed that the estimates were sensitive to the assumption of the proportion of  		patients whose care was capitated. The net financial value could range from a  		$2,300 net cost to a $330,900 net benefit per provider. </p>
<p>The Swedish study examined an EHR system with functionality limited only  		to health information and data storage. Therefore, the expected benefits were  		limited and included increase in knowledge capital for the primary health care  		team, easier and quicker communication for general practitioners during  		telephone consultations, clearer information to patients, and time saved in  		retrieving paper-based medical records.<sup><font><a href="#ref80">80</a></font></sup> Only the value of the last item was  		estimated, at a total of approximately $10,500 (in U.S. 1995 dollars) for the  		first year of EHR implementation. </p>
<p>Despite potential savings from ADE prevention and reduced resource  		utilization under capitated reimbursement, the study of the ambulatory EHR  		system in a HMO (13 outpatient clinics) did not quantify this aspect of  		benefits. Instead, it quantified only the averted costs associated with  		improved efficiency.<sup><font><a href="#ref53">53</a>,  		<a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup> The study estimated an annual savings of  		$3,700,000 (in 1996 dollars) from reduced medical record room and support  		staff, elimination of clinical forms, and automatic collection of billing data.  		</p>
<p>The cancer center study projected the benefits of an EHR over ten  		years.<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> This projection  		made several key assumptions, including no benefit until the third year after  		implementation, benefits to phase-in as the EHR system became functional,  		physician acceptance and use of the system, a link between business management  		benefits and managed care, and productivity changes. The authors divided the  		benefits into capture and access, decision support, optimization of clinical  		practice, business management, and streamlining of patient flow. The estimated  		total quantified benefits were $129.69 million over ten years. Adjusted by the  		total implementation and system costs, the authors' assigned confidence factor,  		and 9.5-percent discount rate, the net value was predicted to be $24.9 million  		(in 1994 dollars). </p>
<p>The other IDN expected even greater benefits from an EHR implementation.  		The authors predicted approximately $68.5 million in gross quantifiable  		benefits over a seven-year period; subtracting the cost of the EHR system  		implementation, the net benefit would be $31.4 million (in 2001 dollars), using  		a 10-percent discount rate.<sup><font><a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> The authors predicted and quantified benefits  		from savings in laboratory and radiology order entry, pharmacy order entry,  		documentation availability of information, and charge capture. </p>
<p>Another study estimated that implementation of a standardized  		interoperable EHR system by all healthcare organizations in the United States  		would yield substantial financial benefits. The health care information  		exchange and interoperability study predicted that investment on a fully  		standardized, Level-4 nationwide system will have the most financial return, a  		net value of $77.8 billion per year once fully implemented.<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> Non-standardized health care  		information exchange and interoperability also can have positive financial  		returns, but the returns are smaller compared to the Level-4 implementation.  		</p>
<p>In summary, despite the heterogeneity in the analytic methods used, all  		five cost-benefit analyses predicted substantial savings from EHR (and health  		care information exchange and interoperability) implementation.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a>, <a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a>,  		<a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> In other words, the quantifiable benefits  		are projected to outweigh the investment costs. However, the predicted time  		needed to break even varied from three<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref81">81</a></font></sup> to six<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a></font></sup> to perhaps as long as 13  		years.<sup><font><a href="#ref54">54</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Conclusion. </b>Our evidence review found consistent predictions from  		five cost-benefit studies that implementation of an EHR system can be  		financially viable at the individual organization level or through a nationwide  		implementation with high levels of health care information exchange and  		interoperability.<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a>, <a href="#ref53">53</a>, <a href="#ref54">54</a>, <a href="#ref55">55</a>,  		<a href="#ref81">81</a>, <a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup> However, there  		are several caveats. </p>
<ol type="1"><li>All studies are predictive analyses that are based on many analytical  		  assumptions and limited empirical data. The strength of evidence is considered  		  weak. </li>
<li>In all studies, the EHR system was assumed to have multiple  		  functionalities that include, at minimum, health information and data storage,  		  administrative processes, decision support, and results management, as well as  		  information exchange capabilities. The functional capability of an EHR system  		  is critical to the benefit accrued. </li>
<li>The individual organizations that were the subjects of four studies  		  were all large organizations. Large organizations involve many people, units,  		  and subsystems and have complicated processes and interactions. They can  		  benefit greatly from automated, transparent information processing through HIT,  		  and substantial economies of scale. The literature review did not identify  		  cost-benefit studies for EHR implementation in small organizations. </li>
<li>The costs of implementing an EHR system may be underestimated. Only  		  one of the five cost-benefit analyses included the cost of the implementation  		  process,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> and it found  		  that this cost was 1.5 times the cost of the EHR system. Implementing an EHR  		  system requires extensive changes in the organizational processes, individual  		  behaviors, and the interactions between the two. These resulting costs are  		  often omitted or not reported from studies but can be substantial. </li>
<li>The financial benefits depend on the financing system. As shown in  		  the sensitivity analysis of one study,<sup><font><a href="#ref52">52</a></font></sup> the benefit estimates are most sensitive to  		  the assumption of the proportion of capitated patients. Realizing all  		  quantifiable benefits of EHR implementation would require changes to the  		  current health care financing system. </li>
<li>Both the cost and the benefit of attaining interoperability among EHR  		  systems are directly proportional to the level of data exchange achieved. For  		  example, the cost of achieving machine-organizable (Level 3) or  		  machine-interpretable (Level 4) interoperability is greatest, but it offers the  		  most potential for increased efficiency, improved healthcare utilization, and  		  reduced costs. </li>
</ol><p>In conclusion, there is some empirical evidence to support the positive  		economic value of an EHR system and the component parts of EHRs. However,  		realizing the projected benefits will require proper alignment of the  		healthcare financing system, strong leadership, effective implementation  		strategies, and focused efforts to successfully adapt the EHR system. </p>

</tr></table><h3>Health Information Technology and Patient  		Centeredness</h3>
<p>Many advocates of HIT believe that one of its primary goals is to  		increase the extent to which the patient is at the center of his or her health  		care. For this report, studies of HIT and "patient centeredness" were defined  		as those that assessed HIT systems that included the element of patient  		decision support/consumer health informatics, telemedicine, or  		data-exchange/community health information networks or that reported patient  		satisfaction as an outcome. From the database of 256 articles there were 34  		unique studies or systematic reviews meeting these criteria. </p>
<p>Ten studies assessed computer-generated reminders. Of these, seven  		assessed the use of reminder programs to improve the delivery of preventive  		care such as mammography and immunizations.<sup><font><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref85">85</a>, <a href="#ref86">86</a>,  		<a href="#ref87">87</a>, <a href="#ref88">88</a>, <a href="#ref89">89</a>,  		<a href="#ref90">90</a></font></sup> All studies reported greater use of  		preventive services by patients--or the physicians of patients--who received  		computer-generated reminders. Two other studies assessed the effect of  		computer-supported or -generated reminder systems for refilling  		medications,<sup><font><a href="#ref91">91</a>, <a href="#ref92">92</a></font></sup> neither of which reported statistically  		significant improvements in compliance. A third study assessed the effect of a  		computer-generated reminder chart on patients' compliance with drug regimens,  		which reported significant improvements in mean compliance score for patients  		receiving an automatically generated reminder chart.<sup><font><a href="#ref93">93</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Seven original studies evaluated various aspects of telemedicine, and a  		review article assessed the role of telemedicine in surgery.<sup><font><a href="#ref94">94</a></font></sup> In the context of surgery,  		telemedicine included tele-mentoring, tele-proctoring, tele-conferencing, and  		tele-presence surgery, all of which are designed to allow physicians to  		communicate and improve the technical delivery of remote surgical procedures.  		Thus, this article was not considered relevant to patient centeredness. Five  		studies assessed telemedicine in particular contexts, including the intensive  		care unit,<sup><font><a href="#ref95">95</a></font></sup> the control  		of essential hypertension,<sup><font><a href="#ref96">96</a></font></sup> the evaluation of patients in an outpatient  		pulmonary clinic,<sup><font><a href="#ref97">97</a></font></sup> the  		role of telemedicine as one component of HIT and its importance to child  		safety,<sup><font><a href="#ref98">98</a></font></sup> and the use of  		a remote video system that allowed nurses and patients to interact in real time  		for patients with a variety of health conditions.<sup><font><a href="#ref99">99</a></font></sup> All of these articles reported benefits from  		the use of telemedicine technologies. The last article in this group was an  		assessment of ComputerLink, which was conceived as an alternative to  		traditional caregiver support services such as support groups and health  		education programs. It was tested in a 12-month randomized trial in family  		caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. Compared with the control group  		that did not have access to ComputerLink, caregivers in the experimental group  		reported more improvement in caregiver strain.<sup><font><a href="#ref100">100</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Three studies assessed the effect on patient trust and satisfaction of  		some aspects of HIT that are used during a patient consultation. In a pre-post  		study of general surgical patients, 96 percent of patients stated that their  		contact with a doctor was as easy and as personal after installation of a  		computer in the office as before the installation.<sup><font><a href="#ref101">101</a></font></sup> In a controlled trial, the use of an  		automatic voice recognition system for transcribing progress notes was not  		associated with any significant negative effect on patient satisfaction, and  		was associated with some positive effects in terms of preventive maintenance  		and patient education.<sup><font><a href="#ref102">102</a></font></sup> We also identified a study that assessed  		the effects of a nursing module used at the point of care. In this time-series  		study, an integrated, menu-driven electronic health record was associated with  		marked increases in nursing documentation and no effect on patient  		satisfaction.<sup><font><a href="#ref103">103</a></font></sup> One  		study assessed physician satisfaction, and was excluded.<sup><font><a href="#ref104">104</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two studies assessed the effect of computer-guided management of  		patients. The first study compared the effect of computer-controlled  		administration of analgesic for post-operative pain to that of  		patient-controlled administration. The computer-controlled infusion used  		custom-written software designed to rapidly attain and maintain a theoretical  		target plasma concentration of the analgesic. In a double-blind randomized  		trial, the study found that computer-controlled analgesia conferred a more  		rapid onset of pain relief and was as effective as patient-controlled  		administration in providing post-operative analgesia.<sup><font><a href="#ref105">105</a></font></sup> Which of these interventions is more  		"patient-centric" may be debatable, however. In the other study,  		computer-guided behavioral therapy that allowed patients to progress through a  		self-paced workbook was compared with clinician-directed behavioral therapy and  		with relaxation therapy in a randomized trial of patients with  		obsessive-compulsive disorder. At ten weeks, the Yale-Brown  		obsessive-compulsive scale showed significantly greater improvement in the  		patients receiving clinician-guided behavior therapy than in the group  		receiving computer-guided behavior therapy, and both of these were  		significantly greater than the improvement attained with relaxation therapy,  		which was found to be essentially ineffective. This study concluded that  		computer-guided behavior therapy was effective and might be a helpful first  		step in treating patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder when  		clinical-guided behavior therapy was unavailable.<sup><font><a href="#ref106">106</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Five studies assessed various aspects of consumer health informatics.  		The interventions included a clinical trial of an interactive computerized  		patient education system in family practice;<sup><font><a href="#ref107">107</a></font></sup> and assessments of the effects of computer  		tailored smoking cessation in family practice,<sup><font><a href="#ref108">108</a></font></sup> the effectiveness of a computer-generated  		patient health summary in changing patients' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior  		concerning health promotion,<sup><font><a href="#ref109">109</a></font></sup> and the use of self-administered  		computerized assessments for psychiatric disorders in patients in primary  		care.<sup><font><a href="#ref110">110</a></font></sup> All of these  		studies reported benefits of the computerized health informatics system. A  		review of 37 studies of computer-generated health behavior interventions  		intended to motivate individuals to adopt various treatment regimens concluded  		that such systems are effective.<sup><font><a href="#ref111">111</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two review articles assessed the effect of various HIT systems that are  		directly accessed by the consumer or patient. One of the reviews assessed ten  		comparative studies of consumers using the Internet to access health  		information and services. This review included controlled studies,  		before-and-after studies, and interrupted time-series analyses of Internet  		users versus nonusers, or of the use of the Internet versus other communication  		media. The authors concluded that rigorous research regarding the effects of  		consumer Internet use on health outcomes is lacking. In the ten studies they  		assessed, all showed some beneficial effects on health outcomes, although the  		authors note the methodological quality of many studies was poor.<sup><font><a href="#ref112">112</a></font></sup> A second review article  		assessed comparative studies evaluating the health or social outcomes of  		virtual peer-to-peer communities, which they characterized as a type of  		electronic support group. Among 45 publications describing 38 studies (of which  		20 were randomized trials), only six evaluated "pure" peer-to-peer communities  		without other interventions. The other studies assessed complex interventions,  		of which a peer-to-peer community was only one component. The authors concluded  		that no good evidence exists on the effects of consumer-led peer-to-peer  		communities, partly because most such interventions have been evaluated only as  		part of a complex intervention or interventions involving health  		professionals.<sup><font><a href="#ref113">113</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One review article assessed what is known about email consultations in  		healthcare. The authors noted that a rapidly expanding proportion of the  		population has access to email and that, while email consultations have the  		potential to play an important role in the delivery of preventive health care  		and facilitation of self-management of chronic disorders, there is little  		evidence from controlled trials that this potential benefit can be translated  		to routine clinical care.<sup><font><a href="#ref114">114</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another review article assessed studies of "electronic communication  		with patients," which was defined to include studies of computerized  		communication, telephone follow-up and counseling, telephone reminders,  		interactive telephone systems, telephone access, and telephone screening. This  		article concluded that distance medicine technology has benefits in the areas  		of preventive care, management of osteoarthritis, cardiac rehabilitation, and  		diabetes care and that "distance medicine technology enables greater continuity  		of care by improving access and supporting the coordination of activities by a  		clinician."<sup><font><a href="#ref115">115</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Last, two studies dealt with data exchange networks or community health  		information networks. One study described the experience of developers of an  		electronic laboratory reporting system.<sup><font><a href="#ref116">116</a></font></sup> In the second study, researchers developed  		a cost-benefit model and used published evidence and expert opinion to assess  		the ten-year rollout and annual cost of healthcare information exchange and  		interoperability, a development that would allow providers to access patient  		health care information in any clinical setting. The researchers concluded that  		a fully standardized interoperable system could save $77.8 billion a year, once  		fully implemented.<sup><font><a href="#ref82">82</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In summary, evidence for an effect of HIT on patient-centeredness in  		health care is sparse. The best evidence is the beneficial effect of using  		computerized patient reminders for preventive care. The evidence for benefits  		of telemedicine and consumer health informatics is also limited to specific  		contexts. Finally, the evidence is much more limited for effects of more  		general interactive HIT (such as the internet or email on health) or the effect  		of implementing HIT systems (such as the electronic health record) on patient  		trust and satisfaction. </p>
<h3>Barriers to HIT Implementation</h3>
<p>All studies initially reviewed were screened for data on barriers to  		adoption and implementation. For this analysis, qualitative studies that were  		primarily focused on barriers and studies that collected quantitative data on  		barriers were included. Studies in which barriers were briefly discussed, but  		were not a primary focus, were excluded. A primary focus on barriers was  		identified through reviewer consensus. </p>
<p>We identified 20 publications that focused on the barriers to  		implementing HIT. Of these, 8 reported the actual or potential barriers  		encountered with specific HIT implementations,<sup><font><a href="#ref55">55</a>, <a href="#ref62">62</a>, <a href="#ref116">116</a>,  		<a href="#ref117">117</a>, <a href="#ref118">118</a>, <a href="#ref119">119</a>, <a href="#ref120">120</a>, <a href="#ref121">121</a>,  		<a href="#ref122">122</a>, <a href="#ref123">123</a>, <a href="#ref124">124</a></font></sup> usually as part of an article discussing  		the implementation. Two articles were short opinion pieces about potential  		barriers from the physician perspective.<sup><font><a href="#ref125">125</a>, <a href="#ref126">126</a></font></sup> Two studies  		assessed the physician time for order entry using CPOE compared to paper  		methods;<sup><font><a href="#ref118">118</a>, <a href="#ref127">127</a></font></sup> both demonstrated that CPOE took more  		physician time, although the study by Overhage and colleagues found this  		additional time to be modest. A third study assessed the effect on primary care  		physicians' time before and after implementation of an EHR system and reported  		that the time for a patient visit actually fell by half a minute with EHR  		use.<sup><font><a href="#ref128">128</a></font></sup> Last, one study  		compared physician user satisfaction with two HIT systems: the VA CPRS system  		and the Mt. Sinai hospital physician order entry system. This study  		demonstrated CPRS users to be much more satisfied than Mt. Sinai hospital users  		on many dimensions and also demonstrated that satisfaction was correlated most  		strongly with the ability of the HIT system to perform tasks in a  		"straightforward" manner.<sup><font><a href="#ref117">117</a></font></sup> Finally, one article was a systematic  		review of physician use of electronic retrieval systems such as  		Medline.<sup><font><a href="#ref129">129</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The other five articles focused more broadly on barriers to HIT  		implementation. One systematic review<sup><font><a href="#ref130">130</a></font></sup> summarized barriers mentioned in the  		medical and pediatric literature that are significant for pediatric practices.  		These barriers were divided into four categories. <i>Situational barriers</i>  		included time and financial pressures, unproven return on investment,  		insufficient access to the internet or to computer technology in the office  		setting, the prohibitive cost of information technology for small practices,  		and software not being supportive of pediatric practice needs. <i>Cognitive and  		or physical barriers</i> include physical disabilities and insufficient  		computer skills. <i>Liability barriers</i> included confidentiality concerns.  		Finally,<i> knowledge and attitudinal barriers</i> included insufficient  		research about information technology in pediatrics, insufficient knowledge  		about benefits afforded by information technology, apprehension about change,  		and philosophical opposition to information technology. </p>
<p>Two studies used surveys to identify barriers in the use of electronic  		medical records<sup><font><a href="#ref131">131</a></font></sup> and  		barriers to implementing CPOE systems in U.S. hospitals.<sup><font><a href="#ref132">132</a></font></sup> In the first of these studies, the authors  		conducted 90 interviews with electronic medical record managers and physician  		champions in 30 physicians' organizations between 2000 and 2002. Key barriers  		to electronic medical record use were high initial financial costs, slow and  		uncertain financial payoffs, and high initial costs in terms of physician time.  		Additional barriers included difficulties with technology, complementary  		changes in support, electronic data exchange, financial incentives, and  		physician attitudes. The authors note that these barriers were most acute for  		physicians in solo/small group practice, which account for a large proportion  		of U.S. physicians. The second article<sup><font><a href="#ref132">132</a></font></sup> reported the results of 52 interviews at 26  		hospitals in various stages of implementation of CPOE--from not considering  		implementation to fully implemented. Most respondents were Chief Information  		Officers; the remainder consisted of Chief Financial Officers, Chief Medical  		Officers, and other management officials. Three main barriers to CPOE adoption  		were identified. The first was physician and organizational resistance due to  		the perceived negative impact on the physician's workflow. The authors noted  		that resistance from physicians could escalate to the point of a "physician  		rebellion," which could derail the entire implementation process. The second  		barrier identified was the high cost, with estimates from prior studies for the  		cost of CPOE ranging from $3 million to $10 million, depending on the  		hospital's size and the level of existing information technology  		infrastructure. The third major barrier identified was product/vendor  		immaturity. Survey respondents reported that many current vendor products did  		not fit the needs of their hospital, and extensive software modifications were  		required to accommodate established workflow in the hospital. </p>
<p>We also identified two recent prominent editorials about barriers to HIT  		implementation that summarized the issues succinctly.<sup><font><a href="#ref133">133</a>, <a href="#ref134">134</a></font></sup> The first of  		these<sup><font><a href="#ref133">133</a></font></sup> identified  		several challenges for adoption of electronic health records. These included  		cost, technical issues, system interoperability, concerns about privacy and  		confidentiality, and a lack of a well trained clinical informatics work force  		to lead the process. This author identified financing as the biggest  		impediment, which he attributed to a misalignment of costs and benefits. He  		noted that while some studies have suggested a substantially positive return on  		HIT investment for the health care system as a whole, those who are expected to  		pay for the systems (physicians and other practice organizations) see only  		about 11 percent of that return on investment. The rest of the savings go to  		those who typically do not pay directly for the electronic health record.  		Another major challenge he identified was system and data interoperability,  		noting that most health care data (whether on paper or electronic) are trapped  		in "silos." A third concern was privacy and confidentiality: the author stated  		that physicians, other health care professionals, and healthcare organizations  		must be vigilant in protecting patient privacy. The last major barrier  		identified was the need for a workforce capable of leading the implementation  		of information technology. </p>
<p>The second editorial<sup><font><a href="#ref134">134</a></font></sup> stated that, despite predictions of a  		"bright and near future" for the use of HIT, this future never seems to be  		realized. The authors attributed the lack of progress in HIT implementation to  		a lack of attention to the social component, citing the need to view the  		clinical workplace as a complex system in which technologies, people, and  		organizational routines dynamically interact, which leads to the following  		observations: </p>
<blockquote><p> "(1) Organizations are simultaneously social (e.g. consisting of  		  people, values, norms and culture) and technical (i.e., without tools,  		  equipment, procedures, technology and facilities the people could not work and  		  the organization would not exist). (2) These social and technical elements are  		  deeply inter-dependent and inter-related--hence the term socio-technical  		  systems. Every change in one element affects the other. (3) Accordingly, good  		  design and implementation is not a technical problem but rather one of jointly  		  optimizing the combined socio-technical system." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors also note, "...an information technology in and of itself  		cannot do anything, and when the patterns of its use are not tailored to the  		workers and their environment to yield high quality care, the technological  		interventions will not be productive. This implies that any IT acquisitions or  		implementation trajectory should, first and foremost, be an organization change  		trajectory." </p>
<p>In summary, studies have identified a large number of barriers to the  		implementation of HIT. These barriers can be classified as situational barriers  		(including time and financial concerns), cognitive and or physical barriers  		(include physical disabilities and insufficient computer skills), liability  		barriers (including confidentiality concerns), and knowledge and attitudinal  		barriers. Cutting across all these categories, however, may be the need for  		clinical medicine as it is now practiced in the majority of settings to undergo  		a major structural and ideological reorganization, so it can be integrated with  		and enjoy the benefits of HIT. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">CHAPTER 4. DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The primary limitation of this review is the quality and quantity of the  		available studies. As we have noted, understanding the benefits and costs of  		implementing a HIT system requires an understanding of the intervention in  		terms of its technical components as well as its human factors, project  		management, and organizational component; and understanding the organization  		implementing the HIT system requires understanding many things about it,  		including its past and current culture of change and the economic situation in  		which it operates. Most of this information is absent for most of the published  		studies of HIT. Past limits on word count in published articles may have  		prevented some authors from including such information in their published  		reports, but recognition of the information that is needed and the recent  		practice of allowing supplementary methodological information to be posted  		online should obviate the problem. </p>
<p>A second limitation is that not all relevant published studies may have  		been identified. While our search efforts were comprehensive, it is inevitable  		that we did not find some relevant studies. An advantage of our interactive  		database of evidence (<a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand">http://healthit.ahrq.gov/tools/rand</a>) is that it can be  		updated easily, so we invite readers to send us the citations for relevant  		articles we may have missed. </p>
<p>We selected only articles that were classified as systematic reviews,  		hypothesis testing, or predictive analysis for more detailed review and  		structured abstracts in our interactive database. These articles tend to have  		less description about how the HIT actually operated and its implementation  		processes than do qualitative, descriptive articles. Although in general we did  		not find good evidence of such critical information in the literature during  		our review processes, we provide citations of qualitative articles in our  		interactive database for interested readers. However, it should be noted that  		while these qualitative articles might contain more contextual information  		about the HIT systems, they are completely lacking in any generalizable  		knowledge about the benefits of HIT, such as reduction in errors or quality  		improvement. Any such studies that compared outcomes (such as error rates) with  		and without a HIT system would have been classified as hypothesis-testing  		studies and would have been included in our analyses. </p>
<p>A third limitation is that we considered only published studies. As  		noted by our TEP, substantially more information regarding implementation may  		have been obtained by contacting leading HIT implementers and conducting  		structured interviews with them. An additional limitation of reliance on  		published studies is that less successful, or failed, HIT attempts may be less  		likely to be published than successful ones (a result of publication bias).  		</p>
<p>A final limitation is that many of the costs and financial benefits of  		EHR will change over the years, because they depend on the changing price of  		such factors as hardware, software, labor costs, and medical prices.  		Consequently, it is not easy to translate costs as they were reported in the  		original article into today's costs. </p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p><b>General Conclusions </b></p>
<ol type="1"><li>Predictive analyses, based on statistical modeling techniques,  		  suggest that HIT has the potential to enable a dramatic transformation in the  		  delivery of health care, making it safer, more effective, and more efficient.  		  The empirical research evidence base supporting HIT benefits is more limited.  		  </li>
<li>Organizations that have realized some of these major gains through  		  the implementation of multi-functional, interoperable HIT systems built around  		  an electronic health record include the VA, Partners, and Regenstrief  		  Institute. </li>
<li>The impact of HIT implementation on cost and quality will not be  		  consistent across institutions, independent of context. The specific context  		  within which HIT is implemented, including the setting, the clinical issues,  		  and the patient populations, greatly influences its use and effects. </li>
<li>More widespread implementation of HIT is limited by the lack of  		  generalizable knowledge about what types of HIT and methods for its  		  implementation will result in changes in benefits and costs that are specific  		  for specific health organizations, especially for small practices and small  		  hospitals. </li>
<li>The reporting of HIT developments and implementations needs to be  		  improved with greater attention to descriptions of both the intervention and  		  the organizational/economic environment in which it is implemented. </li>
<li>A high priority must be placed on establishing standards for the  		  information that needs to be measured and reported in HIT implementation  		  studies, similar to the CONSORT standards for clinical trials of therapeutics.  		  </li>
<li>Using existing published evidence, it is not possible to draw firm  		  conclusions about which HIT functionalities are most likely to achieve certain  		  health benefits. The assessment of costs is even more uncertain. </li>
<li>Existing evidence is not sufficient to clearly define "who pays for"  		  and "who benefits from" HIT implementation in any healthcare organization  		  except those, such as Kaiser and the VA, that are responsible for paying for  		  and delivering all the care for the defined population. </li>
<li>Models can be built to estimate the costs and benefits of  		  interoperable HIT systems within and across health care provider settings,  		  payers/purchasers and cumulatively across the health care continuum, but these  		  models are based on many assumptions. </li>
<li>Implementation of HIT faces many barriers. </li>
</ol><p><b>Pediatrics </b></p>
<ol type="1"><li>Limited empiric evidence exists to support a benefit for HIT use in  		  pediatrics in the areas of medication safety, clinical decision-support,  		  process improvement, and cost reduction. </li>
<li>Only one scientific study weighed these benefits against the costs or  		  cost-effectiveness of implementing HIT systems in pediatric healthcare  		  settings. </li>
<li>A majority of HIT systems for use in pediatric practices were tested  		  and/or developed in academic settings, and the ability to generalize these  		  findings to commercially available systems used in nonacademic settings is  		  limited. </li>
</ol><p><b>EHRs and the Quality of Ambulatory Care </b></p>
<ol type="1"><li>A small set of high quality studies shows that implementation of a  		  comprehensive ambulatory EHR improves quality of care. Available evidence  		  focuses primarily on the impact of ambulatory EHRs on decreasing overused  		  health services by enhancing access to data, providing capabilities for  		  real-time analysis of clinical data, and acting as platforms for decision  		  support. </li>
<li>Ambulatory EHRs improve the structure of care delivery, improve  		  clinical processes, and enhance outcomes. Most available evidence shows the  		  effects of ambulatory EHRs on processes of care. </li>
<li>Interpreting the precise causal effects of ambulatory EHRs on quality  		  is difficult due to lack of systematic and detailed descriptions of system  		  capabilities, limited data (either qualitative or quantitative) on the workflow  		  redesign and organizational changes that accompanied implementation of an  		  ambulatory EHR (or implementation of a new function in an existing EHR  		  package), use of ad hoc measures to assess quality, and use of study designs  		  that do not explicitly take into account sources of bias and confounding. Thus,  		  while existing evidence may have high internal validity, the generalizability  		  of findings is limited. </li>
<li>Although substantial potential exists, evidence for the ability of  		  ambulatory care EHRs to improve quality by making healthcare more consumer- and  		  patient-centered is scant. </li>
</ol><p><b>Economic Value of an HIT and EHR System </b></p>
<ol type="1"><li>The main quantifiable benefits of an EHR system were savings from  		  data capture and access; decision support to improve efficiency, quality, and  		  safety of care; business management related to staffing, billing, and  		  overheads; and streamlining patient flow. </li>
<li>Few studies quantitatively assessed the costs to implement an EHR  		  system and the financial benefits reaped from it. </li>
<li>All the cost-benefit analyses of an EHR system predicted that the  		  financial benefits would significantly outweigh the costs, in a timeframe that  		  varied from three to thirteen years, but this evidence is limited to large  		  organizations and multi-functional EHR systems. </li>
<li>The positive economic estimates for EHR system implementation are  		  encouraging but are based on limited evidence at this time. Only limited  		  empirical evidence supports the assumptions made in the predictive analyses.  		  Most studies omitted the costs of implementing an EHR system that were  		  associated with the temporary loss of productivity and the cost of process  		  redesigns. Moreover, realization of the financial return is highly sensitive to  		  the organization's financial incentives. </li>
<li>There is some evidence regarding the positive economic value of  		  implementing component parts of an EHR system, with models suggesting that many  		  of the benefits do not accrue unless a broadly functional system is  		  implemented. </li>
</ol><h3>Recommendations for Future Research</h3>
<p>This section is divided into two parts: (1) research recommendations and  		(2) recommendations regarding the appropriate types of researchers to carry out  		the recommended work. </p>
<p><b>Recommendations </b></p>
<ol type="1"><li>High on the list of future research is the need for agreed-upon  		  standards for reporting HIT implementation studies, similar in purpose to the  		  CONSORT standards for the reporting of clinical therapeutics trials. </li>
<li>The organizational change and workflow redesign required by and  		  accompanying HIT implementation (or implementation of a new HIT function) need  		  to be described and measured with greater validity, reliability, and precision  		  in order to understand the impact of HIT on care delivery. Without such  		  information, the true "intervention" remains unclear, and the generalizability  		  of results will remain limited. This kind of reporting will require the  		  development and dissemination of publishing standards. </li>
<li>While HIT implementation does not easily lend itself to randomized  		  trials, better use of quasi-experimental study designs and other study designs  		  of high internal validity could greatly enhance the clinical relevance of  		  results, reduce bias and confounding, and increase the generalizability of  		  findings. Currently, the published literature is dominated by simple pre-post  		  implementation designs. </li>
<li>Creative, alternative research methodology should be considered to  		  estimate costs and benefits of HIT as a supplement to traditional  		  hypothesis-testing studies. Traditional experimental or quasi-experimental  		  approaches may be impractical because they are expensive, time-consuming, and  		  interfere with HIT implementation. Qualitative studies are often subjective,  		  descriptive, and lack generalizability. Simulation modeling is a promising  		  alternative to generate knowledge and evidence; it is different from analytical  		  modeling where the result functionally depends on the input (a number of  		  parameters). Simulation, or dynamic, modeling uses a set of rules that define  		  how the system being modeled will change in the future, given its present  		  state, existing knowledge, and foreseeable uncertainties. For complex problems  		  like HIT implementation, where time dynamics is important and experimenting  		  with the real system is expensive or impossible, simulation modeling can  		  support estimates of cost, benefit, and net value of HIT systems. </li>
<li>The costs and benefits of HIT depend not only on the internal system  		  (the practice environment) but also on the interactions with the external  		  system, including consumers (patients and potential users of the healthcare  		  system), medical service suppliers (laboratories, radiology centers, other  		  healthcare organizations), technology suppliers, and the regulatory and  		  financing systems an organization operates. Multi-perspective studies are  		  needed to investigate the flow of costs and benefits in order to maximize the  		  benefits of HIT in the larger healthcare delivery system. Again, simulation  		  modeling may be the best methodology for this type of research. </li>
<li>The conceptual foundation for the impact of EHRs on improving care is  		  strong. More research concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of EHRs across  		  health care settings, providers, and patient populations needs to be carried  		  out. Such research will require focusing on how EHR tools are implemented and  		  utilized in day-to-day practice, a broadening of environments to include  		  nonacademic/nonintegrated network practices, the development of methods and  		  instruments directed at evaluation of externally developed systems, and a  		  broader understanding of the human factors issues relevant to healthcare. </li>
<li>More research is needed on which specific components of an EHR are  		  beneficial and also on evaluating new specific components--for example,  		  clinical decision-support. Much of the existing decision support relies on  		  simple rules, and it should be possible to provide substantially better  		  assistance with the use of more-complex rules and models. </li>
<li>More research is needed to evaluate the effects of EHRs on improving  		  quality by making care more consumer-centered. </li>
<li>Process and outcome benefits of HIT that are important and unique to  		  pediatrics must be better quantified, given the unique workflow and information  		  needs of pediatric organizations and practice settings. A growing body of  		  epidemiologic studies has demonstrated the frequency of medication errors in  		  the pediatric healthcare setting. Well-designed studies are needed to  		  demonstrate empirically the benefit of HIT in improving patient safety, not  		  only in the hospital environment, but also in ambulatory and other settings.  		  </li>
<li>Well-designed studies measuring the costs of HIT implementation and  		  resultant benefits in pediatrics and other vulnerable populations (e.g.,  		  chronically ill, disabled, etc.) are needed, especially in nonacademic settings  		  and with commercially available HIT systems. </li>
</ol><p><b>Recommendations Regarding Public and Private Types of Organizations  		to Perform the Proposed Research and/or Analysis </b></p>
<p>The assessment of HIT implementations of greatest relevance to most U.S.  		healthcare institutions will occur in nonacademic settings. Most nonacademic  		settings have limited research expertise or infrastructure to design and  		support a research project on HIT. If extramural funds are desired for an  		evaluation of HIT implementation, the ability to secure funding coincident with  		the project plan is difficult, if not impossible, especially given the funding  		cycle of grants. Also, to use a pre-and post-implementation design, the  		researcher needs funding for an extended period of time to collect enough data  		to adequately power the study before the HIT system is in place. For financial  		and pragmatic reasons, this pre-implementation data collection cannot delay the  		HIT implementation process. </p>
<p>Therefore, we would suggest that for HIT research to be feasible in  		nonacademic settings with commercial systems, some important steps should be  		taken: </p>
<ol type="1"><li>Create incentives (e.g., matching funds) for nonacademic medical  		  centers and provider organizations to perform high-quality evaluations of  		  vendor-based HIT implementation. These projects should be funded by  		  organizational dollars and support should be provided for academic  		  investigators to partner with such organizations. These measures would help  		  organizations that lack a built-in research infrastructure to conduct rigorous  		  research. </li>
<li>Provide a number of extramural funding mechanisms (government, state,  		  foundation, or even vendor) to evaluate HIT with limited-funding cycles,  		  allowing for adequate pre-implementation measurements and/or rigorous study  		  design. The investigators typically do not determine the timing of  		  implementation, which is often delayed, and funders much be cognizant of this  		  and not penalize the investigators, by disallowing no-cost extensions. </li>
<li>Devise a standard means to adequately assess and describe the  		  "socio-technical" milieu of an organization relevant to HIT implementation.  		  </li>

<td><font>"HIT has the potential to  			 enable a dramatic transformation in the delivery of health care, making it  			 safer, more effective, and more efficient." I think this sentence should be  			 reconsidered in light of the conclusion sections of the case studies. As an  			 evidence report and not a policy paper, the sentence should more closely  			 reflect the findings, which are that the evidence is very limited, from a very  			 small number of studies and organizations, and is inconclusive. The findings  			 are suggestive of future research more than anything else and of the need to  			 systematize data collection about organizations and contexts in order to be  			 able to make comparisons across studies and settings, per the final sentence of  			 this section. Perhaps another point to make is that cost/benefit analysis may  			 be a relatively recent way of looking at </font></td>

<td><font>This report candidly and  			 powerfully lays out the dilemmas involved in the questions it sets out to  			 answer. Simultaneously, however, I feel that it could have made a stronger step  			 forward in arguing for a REPHRASING of the question for ' proof' for 'benefits'  			 than it currently does. ..the important question would be whether the  			 technology technically does what it promises to do (which is a question  			 dependent on the specific application in question) and whether the organization  			 is subsequently ' ready' to use this technology in such a way that it may reap  			 these benefits. The latter question is about proper organizational change,  			 about creating a ' fit' between the technology and the organization which will  			 generate these potential benefits. Again, nobody in that world would consider  			 asking for RCTs or other such designs. The potential benefit, after all, is  			 plain common sense; the question is whether these specific instances  			 (technology and organization) will be able to yield these benefits. That is a  			 substantially different question from interventions such a novel drug where it  			 is NOT plain common sense whether it will yield improved outcomes compared to a  			 placebo or its competitor Whether a particular organization will  			 realize the benefits that such 'common sense' innovation </font></td>

It may be easy to express some  			 of them in dollars but difficult to realize the corresponding cash flows. (For  			 example, the time you spend in traffic may be worth $100/hour, but who is going  			 to pay you for it?) Others may resist expression in dollars.</p>
