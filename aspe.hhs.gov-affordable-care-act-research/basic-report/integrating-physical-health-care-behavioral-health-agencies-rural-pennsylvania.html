<p>As states and communities undertake efforts to integrate physical health  		and behavioral health services, it is critical to understand how these efforts  		are organized and implemented. This study examined the early implementation of  		the Behavioral Health Home Plus program in two county behavioral health  		agencies in rural Pennsylvania. With support from a behavioral health managed  		care organization, each agency hired a registered nurse, provided training for  		its case managers and peer specialists in wellness coaching, and used a  		web-based tool for tracking consumer outcomes. Findings suggest that agencies  		successfully trained their staffs in wellness coaching, integrated registered  		nurses into agency functions, developed care planning processes that  		incorporate physical and behavioral health goals, and increased awareness and  		knowledge of physical health and wellness among behavioral health staff and  		consumers. Given the complexity of introducing physical health services into  		behavioral health care settings, the agencies experienced several early  		implementation challenges including staff role confusion, difficulty  		establishing new procedures and communication protocols among staff members,  		discomfort among case managers and peer specialists in identifying and  		addressing physical health concerns, difficulty developing collaborative  		relationships with primary care providers, and slower-than-expected uptake of  		the web-based tools. The agencies were able to overcome many of these  		challenges with support from the behavioral health managed care organization.  		The study provides insights into the practical aspects of integrating care and  		offers recommendations for future efforts.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) have high rates of  		chronic physical health conditions, including metabolic disorders and  		cardiovascular disease (De Hert et al. 2011; Newcomer 2007; Newcomer and  		Hennekens 2007; McEvoy et al. 2005). Unfortunately, the delivery of behavioral  		and physical health care for people with SMI is fragmented and poorly  		coordinated (Collins et al. 2010). In response, the Substance Abuse and Mental  		Health Services Administration, state Medicaid programs, health plans, and  		mental health systems are making efforts to integrate care for this population.  		Embedding or co-locating physical health providers in specialty behavioral  		health care settings (often referred to as reverse co-location) is one of  		several strategies proposed to improve the integration of services for people  		with SMI (Collins et al. 2010). Even though interventions that incorporate the  		co-location of physical health providers in behavioral health care settings has  		yielded some promising results (Druss et al., 2010), relatively little is known  		about how behavioral health agencies incorporate physical health services into  		their organizations and workflows. </p>
<p>Under the leadership of Community Care Behavioral Health (CCBH), the  		Behavioral Health Home Plus(BHHP) program was implemented in two community  		behavioral health agencies that serve five rural counties in Pennsylvania. BHHP  		aimed to improve the integration of physical and behavioral health services for  		Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI through several activities: (1) embedding a  		registered nurse in each behavioral health agency to develop an  		interdisciplinary care team and address consumers' physical health conditions;  		(2) training case managers and peer specialists within the behavioral health  		agencies to become wellness coaches, thereby helping consumers identify and  		address physical health and wellness goals; (3) tracking consumers' progress in  		reaching wellness goals, including their use of a web-based portal; and (4)  		strengthening collaborations between behavioral health agencies and primary  		care providers (PCPs) in the community. The program targeted Medicaid  		beneficiaries with SMI (including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major  		depression, or borderline personality disorder) who received services through  		the Columbia, Montour, Snyder, and Union counties and Northumberland County  		behavioral health agencies.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The study presents the early implementation experiences of BHHP in order  		to explain: (1) how the agencies integrated physical health care into routine  		practice; (2) the types of training and support needed to co-locate nursing  		staff and orient agency staff to physical health care; (3) the strategies used  		to identify consumers in need of physical health care and wellness services;  		(4) the approaches for strengthening collaborations with PCPs in the community;  		and (5) consumers' perception on this new model of care. We used a qualitative  		case study approach to generate in-depth information about BHHP's early  		implementation and to gather real-world experiences with the model from staff,  		consumers, and other key stakeholders. We collected qualitative information  		during two rounds of site visits that included discussions with agency staff  		and stakeholders, consumer focus groups, observations of the program  		environment, and document reviews. We used inductive and deductive analytic  		techniques to identify themes from the qualitative data.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The development of BHHP involved an extensive planning process that  		included stakeholders from several counties and input from consumers. Findings  		suggest that the behavioral health agencies successfully trained their staffs  		in wellness coaching and integrated registered nurses into agency functions.  		Other short-term outcomes that emerged include the development of care planning  		processes that incorporate physical and behavioral health goals and an  		increased awareness and knowledge of physical health and wellness among  		behavioral health staff and consumers. Given the complexity of introducing new  		processes of care to behavioral health agencies, they experienced several  		challenges during the program's early implementation. These challenges  		included, staff role confusion, difficulty establishing new procedures and  		communication protocols among staff members, discomfort among case managers and  		peer specialists in identifying and addressing physical health concerns,  		difficulty building collaborative relationships with PCPs, and  		slower-than-expected uptake of web-based tools for tracking consumer  		outcomes.</p>
<p>Agency staff and CCBH developed several strategies to overcome the  		challenges of integrating nurses and expanding the roles of case managers and  		peer specialists. CCBH worked with agency leaders to clarify roles and develop  		written job descriptions for both nurses and case managers to help delineate  		their roles and responsibilities. A high-risk care manager from CCBH initiated  		meetings with nurses on a weekly basis to assist with role clarification,  		provide a resource for information, and discuss ongoing wellness activities. In  		an effort to improve communication and coordination across the care team,  		leaders from one agency included the nurse in daily meetings with supervisors  		and invited her to attend weekly meetings with case managers to discuss  		consumers engaged in wellness activities.</p>
<p>Some case managers and peer specialists struggled to assume their new  		role as wellness coaches. At the program's outset, their discomfort contributed  		to their tendency to refer almost all consumers with physical health problems,  		even relatively minor problems, to the nurse. Some case managers also expressed  		concern about whether consumers would be comfortable with case managers  		functioning as wellness coaches--not because of concerns related to privacy but  		rather because some consumers did not perceive that physical health or wellness  		fell within case managers' scope of practice. </p>
<p>Agencies and consumers experienced difficulty in tracking consumers'  		progress toward physical health and wellness goals. Consumer and staff use of  		the web portal was much more modest than expected; some staff noted the  		challenges of technology use in a rural setting, including the lack of Internet  		connectivity and/or computer access. Agencies needed to create more formal  		mechanisms for tracking processes of care to monitor who received wellness  		coaching and what the coaching included.</p>
<p>Engaging PCPs was challenging for agencies; barriers included the  		competing demands of primary care staff and their limited familiarity with  		behavioral health services, case management, and peer services. Nurse  		attendance at PCP appointments with consumers was cited as an effective way to  		interact with PCPs and demonstrate the value of the wellness program to primary  		care staff. </p>
<p>Consumers in the focus groups were uniformly positive about their  		experience in receiving care from the nurse. However, some consumers noted that  		they were not comfortable disclosing physical health information to case  		managers, but other consumers welcomed and expected their case managers to  		communicate with other agency staff about their physical health and wellness  		goals.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Developing a service setting that integrates primary care and behavioral  		health services is a long-term process that requires substantial investment in  		staff training and other resources (Heath et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2012). As  		with other complex interventions, changing staff roles and responsibilities and  		adapting well-established workflows involve trial and error (Campbell et al.  		2007). The study highlighted early implementation challenges as well as key  		successes of the agencies in incorporating wellness coaching into their regular  		routines, integrating registered nurses into agency functions, developing care  		planning processes that incorporate physical and behavioral health goals, and  		increasing awareness and knowledge of physical health and wellness among  		behavioral health staff and consumers. Findings suggest that training case  		managers to function as wellness coaches, integrating a nurse into a behavioral  		health agency, implementing web-based health assessment tools for people with  		SMI, and strengthening collaborations with PCPs are ambitious tasks that  		require a significant culture shift for both providers and consumers. Based on  		the successes and challenges of BHHP, similar efforts would benefit from: (1)  		adequate planning to clarify the team's roles and responsibilities and to  		establish mechanisms for regular communication; (2) committing to ongoing  		training to help staff become more comfortable in addressing physical health  		needs and implementing wellness coaching; (3) obtaining ongoing input from  		consumers and staff to guide program development; and (4) developing mechanisms  		to track physical health and wellness activities and consumer outcomes.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3>A. Background</h3>
<p>Individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) have high rates of  		chronic physical health conditions, including metabolic disorders and  		cardiovascular disease (De Hert et al. 2011; Newcomer 2007; Newcomer and  		Hennekens 2007; McEvoy et al. 2005). These health conditions are associated  		with high rates of tobacco use and obesity and the side effects of  		antipsychotics and other psychiatric medications (De Hert et al. 2011;  		Lieberman et al. 2005). Although estimates vary, evidence suggests that these  		chronic physical conditions and health behaviors contribute to premature  		mortality among individuals with SMI (Laursen 2011; Colton and Manderscheid  		2006; Parks et al. 2006).</p>
<p>The literature clearly demonstrates that the delivery of behavioral  		health services and physical health care for people with SMI is fragmented and  		poorly integrated (Collins et al. 2010). Individuals with SMI and comorbid  		diabetes or cardiovascular disease receive suboptimal care (Mitchell et al.  		2012; Clark et al. 2009; Nasrallah et al. 2006; Frayne et al. 2005; Desai et  		al. 2003), and few receive comprehensive services. Recent research has found  		that only 11 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia or bipolar  		disorder receive a comprehensive physical health examination during the year  		and that fewer than half of those receiving antipsychotics obtain annual  		laboratory monitoring to screen for cardiovascular disease or diabetes (Brown  		et al. 2012). The low figures may be partly attributable to the fact that only  		one-third of community mental health centers have the capacity to provide  		on-site medical care (Druss et al. 2008). </p>
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, state  		Medicaid programs, health plans, and mental health systems are engaged in  		efforts to integrate care for this population. Embedding or co-locating  		physical health providers in specialty behavioral health care settings (often  		referred to as reverse co-location) is among several strategies advanced to  		improve service integration (Collins et al. 2010). Policymakers, researchers,  		advocates, and providers have proposed that increasing the capacity of  		specialty behavioral health care settings to function as comprehensive health  		homes may be a particularly promising strategy for individuals with SMI. For  		such individuals, specialty behavioral health care settings are often their  		primary or only point of contact with the health care system (Alakeson et al.  		2010). In 2009, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  		and the Health Resources and Services Administration launched an initiative  		that provides grants to community mental health providers to build their  		capacity to function as health homes that provide comprehensive physical and  		behavioral health services. At the same time, state Medicaid programs and  		managed care organizations have been experimenting with models of care that  		seek to improve the integration and coordination of services for the SMI  		population in an effort to improve quality of care while reducing costs  		(Greenberg 2012; Kim et al. 2012; Hamblin et al. 2011).</p>
<p>Drawing largely on the Chronic Care Model (Wagner et al. 1996),  		strategies to improve the integration of physical and behavioral health  		services typically involve some combination of staff training and realignment  		of staff roles, co-locating providers when possible, strengthening  		collaborative relationships between/among providers, sharing health information  		between/among providers and/or payment systems, and empowering and educating  		consumers (Collins et al. 2010). A recent meta-analysis concluded that  		intervention strategies involving some combination of these components improve  		depressive symptoms, quality of life, and role functioning, but it notes that  		more research is needed to understand how the strategies work in specialty  		behavioral health care settings among populations with heterogeneous mental  		health conditions (Woltmann et al. 2012). </p>
<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that co-location strategies in  		behavioral health care settings and other care management interventions can  		improve the use of physical health services, health-related quality of life,  		and metabolic functioning (Druss et al. 2010) and may reduce emergency  		department utilization and inpatient hospitalization among people with SMI (Kim  		et al. 2012). To complement the evidence in the literature, additional studies  		are needed to examine the implementation of these strategies in specialty  		behavioral health care settings to inform their replication and dissemination.  		The need for research that examines the strengths and limitations of  		co-location strategies in behavioral health settings is particularly acute  		given the increased pressure on these settings to serve as health homes for the  		SMI population, especially in rural and underserved communities where the  		resources for both physical and mental health services are limited.</p>
<h3>B. Program Description</h3>
<p>Beginning in November 2011, Community Care Behavioral Health (CCBH)  		piloted the Behavioral Health Home Plus (BHHP) program in two community  		behavioral health agencies that serve five rural counties in Pennsylvania. CCBH  		provided leadership and guidance to the agencies during program implementation.  		Although CCBH was the key driver of program development and was available to  		provide ongoing clinical and administrative support, the ultimate goal was for  		agencies to take ownership of the program.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania operates a county-based capitated behavioral health  		carve-out wherein CCBH, a behavioral health managed care organization, manages  		behavioral health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. At the pilot's outset, a  		separate noncapitated primary care case management program (not managed by  		CCBH) provided physical health services.<sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#note1">1</a></sup> CCBH  		selected the Columbia, Montour, Snyder, and Union (CMSU) Counties Program and  		Northumberland County Behavioral Health/Intellectual Development Services to  		participate in the pilot because these two agencies provided a comprehensive  		array of services and expressed interest in the program. The two agencies also  		provided, either directly or through contracts with other community  		organizations, crisis intervention and clubhouse recovery centers. In  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#tableI.1">Table I.1</a>, we present the characteristics of each  		agency.</p>

<li>CMSU employs 17 additional certified peer specialists who hold  				  various positions within the agency that do not involve one-on-one peer work  				  with consumers.</li>
</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>BHHP targeted Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI (including schizophrenia,  		bipolar disorder, major depression, or borderline personality disorder) who  		received services through the CMSU and Northumberland community behavioral  		health agencies. Based on 2009 claims, CCBH estimated that 2,741 Medicaid  		beneficiaries age 18 and older in the five-county region (or 15.8 percent of  		the Medicaid population) had an SMI diagnosis. Among the SMI population, 25  		percent (692 individuals) had at least one case management or peer specialist  		claim, and 68 percent (1,871) had at least one case management, peer  		specialist, or outpatient behavioral health claim. Adults with SMI were likely  		to have comorbid conditions as evidenced by the presence of claims for  		substance use disorders (14 percent), diabetes (14 percent), pulmonary  		conditions (25 percent), and cardiovascular conditions (33 percent).<sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#note2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>BHHP's aim was to provide a health home for Medicaid beneficiaries with  		SMI and to improve the integration of physical and behavioral health services  		through several activities: (1) embedding a registered nurse in each community  		behavioral health agency to create an interdisciplinary care team equipped to  		address physical health conditions and problem health behaviors; (2) training  		case managers and peer specialists employed by community behavioral health  		agencies to become "wellness coaches" to help consumers identify and address  		physical health and wellness goals (for example, smoking cessation and weight  		management); (3) tracking consumers' progress in reaching wellness goals,  		including use of a web-based portal; and (4) strengthening collaborations  		between behavioral health agencies and primary care providers (PCPs) in the  		community to improve care coordination among providers for individuals with SMI  		and physical health comorbidities.</p>
<p>CCBH established an enhanced case management service rate for the  		agencies to support the nurses' salaries.<sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#note3">3</a></sup> The  		agencies partnered with the Health Care Quality Unit of Geisinger Health  		System, a major health system in north central Pennsylvania, to identify and  		hire a nurse for each agency. Given that Geisinger's Health Care Quality Unit  		retained clinical and administrative oversight of the nurses, Geisinger staff  		provided the nurses with ongoing mentoring, resources, and support.</p>
<p>CCBH contracted with an expert in psychiatric rehabilitation,<sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#note4">4</a></sup> to conduct the training in wellness coaching. The  		training followed a train-the-trainer approach that combined didactic and  		experiential learning and targeted agency leaders who, in turn, trained case  		managers and peer specialists within their respective agencies. The  		train-the-trainer program consisted of a seven-session curriculum (six two-hour  		sessions and one full-day session), and the training for case managers and peer  		specialists consisted of five sessions. The training for trainers focused on  		peer-to-peer, in-office contact with consumers. Nurses attended a separate  		training session, similar in content as the one for trainers. The training for  		case managers and peer specialists focused on the knowledge and skills  		(including motivational interviewing) needed to engage consumers in physical  		health care and wellness activities. For the latter training, the trainers  		modified the training somewhat to reflect case managers' activities outside the  		office and to include additional content on physical health conditions. During  		the training sessions, the agencies introduced a physical wellness planning  		tool--a five-page worksheet to help consumers identify wellness goals,  		challenges, action steps, and resources based on their areas of strength, areas  		of need, and satisfaction with six life domains (diet and nutrition, physical  		activity, sleep/rest, relaxation/stress management, medical care/screening, and  		habits and routines/other). </p>
<p>In addition to the training, CCBH implemented a web-based portal that  		permitted consumers to complete health screening tools and track their sleep,  		weight/body mass index, and tobacco use.<sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#note5">5</a></sup> CCBH  		expected staff at the behavioral health agencies to introduce the web portal to  		consumers and motivate them to use it. CCBH also provided ongoing technical  		support to the behavioral health agencies, including regular meetings to  		discuss implementation challenges and develop strategies for identifying  		consumers with chronic physical health conditions or those at risk of  		developing such conditions. As the intervention progressed, CCBH made available  		a high-risk care manager to meet with the nurses weekly, serve as a liaison  		between the CCBH and the agencies, and discuss specific cases as needed.  		Finally, CCBH created an environment that encouraged problem solving to address  		the challenges of delivering integrated care.</p>
<p>All consumers who came into contact with the agencies to receive  		wellness coaching from nurses, case managers, or peer specialists. Consumers  		could request to receive wellness coaching or physical health services through  		either self-referral or referral from a staff member but it was the expectation  		that staff would integrate physical health care and wellness coaching into  		their routine encounters with all consumers.</p>
<h3>C. Purpose of Study</h3>
<p>The study sought to generate information that policymakers, state  		Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, providers, and advocates could  		use to design and implement similar intervention strategies. It set out to  		answer the following questions: </p>
<ol><li>
<p>How did the county behavioral health agencies integrate nurses and  			 adapt workflows and processes to accommodate the delivery of physical health  			 care and wellness goals? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What types of training and support were needed in order for  			 behavioral health agency staff and nurses to implement wellness coaching?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did nurses, case managers, and peer specialists identify  			 consumers with physical health or wellness needs and engage them in wellness  			 activities? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did behavioral health agency staff and consumers track progress  			 toward reaching wellness goals, including use of the web-based portal?  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What strategies did the behavioral health agencies use to strengthen  			 their relationships with PCPs? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did consumers view the adoption of physical health care and  			 wellness coaching in behavioral health care settings?</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Given the developmental nature of the BHHP pilot and its recent  		implementation, we conducted a formative evaluation to understand early  		implementation successes and challenges in order to guide the refinement of  		BHHP, and inform the future evaluation of outcomes. Further, the evaluation  		highlighted the real-world experiences of implementing a reverse co-location  		model in a rural setting in an effort to provide a rich description of the  		intervention's components, implementation challenges, and solutions, which may  		be useful for other states and communities seeking to implement similar  		efforts. We used a qualitative case study approach to yield in-depth  		information about program implementation by conducting a series of discussions  		with stakeholders, focus groups with consumers, and program observations. </p>
<h2><a name="methods" id="methods">II. METHODS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Sources</h3>
<p>We collected qualitative information through two rounds of site visits  		that included consumer focus groups, stakeholder discussions, direct  		observations of the program environment, and document review. Information  		gathering took place in June and July 2012, and the second round took place  		between January and March 2013. A two-person team (one led the discussion, one  		took notes) conducted semistructured discussions with key stakeholders  		including agency leaders, case management staff and supervisors, peer  		specialists, psychiatrists, the wellness nurses hired for BHHP and their  		supervisors at Geisinger Health System, and CCBH representatives.<sup><a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#note6">6</a></sup> Our discussions with each group of staff were  		tailored to their role in the clinic and involvement with the intervention.  		During each round of site visits, a two-person team conducted two focus groups,  		with up to nine consumers in each group. The discussions and focus groups  		covered the topics summarized in <a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#tableII.1">Table II.1</a>. We toured  		the wellness clinic and a clubhouse in Northumberland and the outpatient clinic  		in CMSU. After each site visit, we conducted phone calls with additional agency  		staff and CCBH representatives by telephone.</p>

<p>After each discussion or focus group, one researcher finalized the  		notes, consulting the audio recording to verify information as needed; the  		second researcher reviewed the notes. Both researchers identified major themes  		that emerged from the discussions, using inductive techniques to identify  		themes and hypotheses in our discussion guides and deductive techniques to  		derive themes from the discussions and focus groups. The researchers compared  		themes and triangulated them across respondent types to ensure that the  		findings were shaped by the respondents and not by researcher bias or interest.  		The researchers then met to discuss the themes and to resolve any areas of  		disagreement. A third researcher who did not directly participate in the site  		visits or discussions also reviewed the notes to identify themes and major  		findings.</p>
<h2><a name="results" id="results">III. RESULTS</a></h2>
<p>CCBH and leaders from the behavioral health agencies used several  		strategies to implement the following key components of BHHP: (1) integrating  		nurses and adapting workflows and processes for case managers and peer  		specialists; (2) providing training and ongoing support for case managers, peer  		specialists, and nurses; (3) identifying and engaging consumers in wellness and  		physical health goals; (4) tracking consumers' progress toward wellness goals  		and use of the web portal; and (5) strengthening relationships with PCPs.  		Agencies successfully trained their staffs in wellness coaching, integrated  		registered nurses into agency functions, developed care planning processes that  		incorporate physical and behavioral health goals, and increased awareness and  		knowledge of physical health and wellness among behavioral health staff and  		consumers. As expected with any complex intervention that introduces new  		processes of care, the agencies encountered several early implementation  		challenges and, in collaboration with CCBH, identified solutions to those  		challenges (<a href="../daltcp/reports/2014/ruralPA.shtml.html#tableIII.1">Table III.1</a>). Below, we describe each of  		the implementation strategies, challenges, and solutions as related to the  		research questions.</p>

</tr></table><h3>A. Integrating Nurses and Adapting Workflows and  		Processes for Case Managers and Peer Specialists</h3>
<p><b>Nurses, case managers, and peer specialists needed clearly defined  		roles and responsibilities</b>. Several staff, including nurses, noted  		confusion about nurses' roles and responsibilities. For example, some staff  		members thought that the nurse would be an external resource for the agencies,  		not a resource that needed to be integrated into other agency functions; others  		expected that the nurse would travel to meet with consumers and conduct  		provider outreach rather than be stationed within the agency. In response, CCBH  		worked with agency leaders to clarify roles and to develop written job  		descriptions for nurses and case managers. In addition, about five months into  		implementation, a CCBH high-risk care manager began meeting with the nurses on  		a weekly basis to assist with role clarification and discuss ongoing wellness  		activities and specific cases, as needed.</p>
<p><b>Agencies needed significant time to expand the role of case managers  		and peerspecialists to address wellness and physical health needs more  		formally</b>. Case managers and peer specialists were introduced to BHHP during  		the training in wellness coaching. As described below, the training in coaching  		focused on general strategies for helping consumers develop wellness plans and  		engaging them in achieving their wellness goals, but it did not provide  		instruction on the protocols that case managers and peer specialists should use  		to incorporate wellness coaching into their routine encounters with consumers.  		Further, the wellness assessment and planning tools were not integrated into  		case managers' existing case management service plans. As a result, many case  		managers viewed wellness assessment and planning as an additional burden.</p>
<p>Given their lack of formal medical education, case managers noted the  		value of relying on the nurse to explain and interpret medical information.  		Case managers were responsible for the same number of consumers in their  		caseloads as before the program was implemented, with some noting that  		sometimes the required wellness paperwork prevented them from encouraging  		consumers to identify a wellness goal unless the consumer demonstrated strong  		commitment or interest. In general, case managers believed that the nurse was  		more qualified than they were to interact with medical providers and develop  		wellness plans with consumers.</p>
<p><b>Defining the role and functions of the nurse unfolded differently in  		each agency</b>. Nurses were uniformly positive about engaging consumers in  		wellness planning and assisting them in managing their physical health  		conditions. Because the nurse's role was new, the behavioral health agencies  		gave the nurses a fair amount of latitude in defining their role. One feature  		that characterized the role of the nurses was their engagement with PCPs and  		medical specialists. The nurse at CMSU attended medical appointments with  		consumers; in Northumberland, case managers did so. However, the nurse in the  		latter agency believed that nurses' interactions with PCPs and other providers  		would prove valuable.</p>
<p>The CMSU nurse assumed responsibility for providing wellness coaching to  		46 consumers; conducted weekly group education sessions; and functioned as a  		resource for agency staff (for example, providing education on common physical  		health conditions). She assigned a high priority to accompanying consumers to  		medical appointments to ensure that they understood what was discussed during  		the appointments. She coordinated her interactions with consumers around their  		other provider visits (for example, she scheduled meetings with them before or  		after their appointments with their psychiatrist or therapist). After a  		doctor's appointment or hospital discharge, she provided follow-up education to  		make sure consumers understood their discharge instructions and filled  		prescriptions for new medications. For example, for a consumer with a new  		diabetes diagnosis, she provided follow-up instruction in how to use a  		glucometer and interpret readings. As a Geisinger Health System employee, the  		nurse was authorized--with consumer consent--to access the electronic health  		records for about two-thirds of the consumers in her caseload, enabling her to  		identify patterns in service use across the health system, including when a  		consumer was admitted and discharged from the emergency department. She also  		initiated team meetings for consumers with more complex medical needs to ensure  		that everyone on the team was conveying the same messages to the affected  		consumers.</p>
<p>At the time of our last site visit, the wellness nurse's role was in  		transition in Northumberland. Agency leaders emphasized the importance of case  		managers serving as the health navigator/wellness coach and the nurse serving  		as a consultant for addressing health crises in a time-limited way. The nurse  		had 20 open cases but felt that she could manage more. She also conducted staff  		education and group education in community settings.</p>
<p><b>Creation of regular opportunities for formal and informal interaction  		fostered collaboration and communication between agency staff and nurses</b>.  		Agencies required several months to integrate the nurse into the care team and  		to develop strategies to ensure communication and coordination across the team.  		At the program's outset, agencies did not specify the mechanisms or frequency  		with which the nurses should interact with other agency staff members. Some  		staff noted that they would have benefited from regular meetings with the nurse  		to discuss the status of consumer referrals. The somewhat isolated location of  		the nurse's office may have further impeded communication between the nurse and  		case managers within one agency. To improve communication, agency leaders  		included the nurse in daily meetings with supervisors and invited her to attend  		weekly meetings with case managers in order to review new referrals and ongoing  		cases. In Northumberland, the nurse's office was located in the waiting room of  		the outpatient clinic, thereby increasing consumers' access to the nurse when  		consumers visited their psychiatrist. The arrangement also provided  		opportunities for informal interaction between the nurse and case managers and  		psychiatrists. Nurses also spent two days each week at different agency  		clubhouses, creating opportunities to interact spontaneously with consumers and  		other staff members.</p>
<h3>B. Providing Training and Ongoing Support for Physical  		Health and Behavioral Health Integration</h3>
<p><b>Changing processes of care to incorporate physical health and  		behavioral health care requires a commitment to ongoing training and  		support</b>. Although case managers recognized the importance of integrating  		care, due to their lack of medical education, they were apprehensive about  		addressing physical health conditions. Given that CCBH and agency leaders  		recognized that staff would benefit from more in-depth education on acute and  		chronic physical health conditions, CCBH contracted with a physician after the  		program's launch to conduct module-based training in strategies for working  		with consumers on weight management and smoking cessation. The in-person  		training provided workbooks for staff on engaging consumers. Agency leaders and  		staff recognized that case managers do not have the time to participate in  		lengthy training given their need to meet productivity requirements for billing  		purposes. Nonetheless, case managers uniformly agreed that they would benefit  		from still more training in wellness coaching, management of physical health  		conditions, and use of the web portal (described below).</p>
<p>The nurses reported that they received an appropriate amount of training  		and support for their roles. They were uniformly positive about the training in  		wellness coaching. They received ongoing support from their nurse supervisors  		at Geisinger Health System, through which they had access to various training,  		continuing education, and professional development opportunities. In turn, the  		nurses educated agency staff by, for example, posting educational information  		in locations throughout the agency and discussing physical health topics during  		staff meetings.</p>
<h3>C. Identifying and Engaging Consumers in Wellness and  		Physical Health Goals</h3>
<p><b>Agencies relied largely on consumer self-referral and the judgment of  		case managers, peer specialists, and nurses to identify consumers for  		participation in the program</b>. At the program's outset, the agencies did not  		establish criteria for assessing how to identify consumers with physical health  		or wellness needs or when to refer consumers to the nurse; instead, the  		agencies left the case finding process and referral decisions to case managers  		and peer specialists. Given their reluctance to distinguish between minor and  		severe physical health concerns, case managers and peer specialists often  		referred consumers with any type of physical health complaint--regardless of  		severity--to the nurse. In response, CCBH and agency leaders developed a list  		of criteria for case managers and peer specialists to use when making referrals  		to the nurse. Consumers also self-referred to the nurse by expressing interest  		in addressing a physical health concern or participating in wellness  		activities. In addition to accepting referrals within their agencies, the  		nurses attempted to increase referrals to the program by collaborating with  		social workers associated with the psychiatric units of two local hospitals and  		including information about the agencies' wellness programs as part of the  		hospitals' discharge instructions. </p>
<p>CCBH had hoped to use physical health cost and utilization data from the  		Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare to target wellness services to  		consumers at high risk for physical health problems or those with chronic  		physical health conditions. However, delays in obtaining the data prevented  		such recruitment. Six months after program implementation, the agencies  		received the data; by this time, agency leaders reported that the agencies  		already knew the majority of consumers with high physical health utilization  		and costs and did not use the data to identify or prioritize potential  		consumers. </p>
<p><b>Peer specialists were a valuable resource for consumers but were not  		fully integrated into care teams or routine agency functions</b>. The use of  		peer specialists was a relatively new endeavor for the agencies, and each  		agency relied on a different management structure for peer specialists. In  		Northumberland, the agency did not directly employ the peer specialists and had  		not yet fully integrated them into agency functions (for example, peers did not  		participate in staff meetings and routine care planning meetings). Conversely,  		CMSU directly employed peer specialists in an arrangement that seemingly  		facilitated integration with the care team. For example, at CMSU, team meetings  		between case managers and other behavioral health providers took place more  		regularly in the case of consumers with a higher level of need; to promote  		greater coordination, the agency was starting to hold cross-department meetings  		to identify consumers who used various services across the agency. As a result,  		agency staff knew which consumers worked with a peer, which was not the case at  		BHHP's outset.</p>
<h3>D. Tracking Consumers' Progress and Using the Web  		Portal</h3>
<p><b>Although CCBH monitored use of the web portal and completion of  		surveys and health trackers, the agencies lacked a system to document  		integration activities</b>. Agencies had not established a process for case  		managers and peer specialists to document activities related to wellness  		coaching as a means of assessing the types of services provided to consumers.  		Even though agencies created paper-based forms for referring consumers to the  		nurse and for wellness planning, the information from the forms was not  		compiled in a format readily available for analysis. In contrast to the case  		managers and peer specialists, wellness nurses documented how they spent their  		time and then submitted such information to their supervisors at Geisinger  		Health System. Further, at the conclusion of our study, CCBH was discussing  		process-of-care measures for the nurses with agency leaders (for example,  		tracking the number of consumers assessed for wellness goals). CCBH was also  		planning to collaborate with the agencies to develop outcome measures and link  		performance on these measures with the enhanced case management rate.</p>
<p><b>Consumer and staff use of the web portal was more modest than  		expected; some staff noted the challenges of implementing such technology in a  		rural setting</b>. Agency leaders, case managers, peer specialists, and the  		wellness nurses uniformly agreed that it was difficult to motivate consumers to  		use the web portal. About one year after the portal's implementation, fewer  		than 50 consumers had completed one of the assessment tools, and even fewer had  		completed one of the trackers. Agency staff acknowledged that both consumers  		and staff experienced difficulty in accessing the web portal. Many staff and  		consumers were more accustomed to using paper for tracking health information.  		Some case managers noted that it was helpful when the nurse registered  		consumers for use of the portal after conducting education sessions in  		community settings where a computer was available. </p>
<p>Some agency staff perceived that some consumers lacked motivation and/or  		interest in using of the portal, whereas others noted issues related to the  		rural setting, such as limited computer access and transportation. For example,  		use of the portal required a consumer's investment of time that often could not  		be coordinated with the pick-up and drop-off schedule of the public  		transportation services. Some consumers participating in the focus groups  		expressed a lack of interest in using a computer while others reported that  		they had used the portal but had difficulty remembering their password. Some  		agency staff also noted mental health symptoms such as paranoia as a challenge  		to using the web portal. Some staff identified that the portal's absence of a  		training function was a deterrent to use by case managers because they could  		not experiment with it or gain proficiency in its use. Finally, some suggested  		that the web portal should be more interesting and interactive and that others  		implementing a similar technology should consider ways to provide ongoing  		support and update information to ensure that the portal continues to engage  		consumers. To address some of these challenges, CCBH enhanced the web portal's  		content and developed a webinar training module for staff.</p>
<h3>E. Strengthening Relationships with Primary Care  		Providers</h3>
<p><b>Nurse presence at PCP appointments with consumers was an effective  		way to interact with providers and demonstrate the value of the wellness  		program</b>. CCBH envisioned that the program would facilitate partnerships  		between behavioral health agencies and PCPs, thereby resulting in improved  		provider-to-provider communication and, ultimately, better consumer outcomes.  		The agencies varied in their approaches to engagement. As mentioned,  		Northumberland leaders tasked case managers with engaging PCPs, whereas the  		CMSU wellness nurse assumed the same responsibility. CMSU leaders noted that  		case managers' attendance at PCP appointments did not have the same effect as  		nurse engagement because case managers were unfamiliar with medical  		terminology. </p>
<p>The CMSU nurse embraced the role of consumer-provider liaison,  		initiating contact with PCPs and specialists who provided care for about half  		the consumers in her caseload. She introduced herself during PCP and specialist  		office visits and was responsive to consumers' immediate health concerns, such  		as a heart condition or a high-risk pregnancy. The nurse viewed her role as  		that of consumer advocate, which meant helping to ensure that PCPs and  		specialists addressed consumers' physical health needs and that consumers  		understood physician instructions. Some consumers, case managers, and agency  		leaders perceived that some medical providers were more receptive to physical  		health concerns of individuals with SMI when a nurse was there to help present  		all aspects of a consumer's health. In general, agencies found it difficult to  		engage PCPs given the competing demands of PCPs' busy schedules. In addition,  		some agency staff perceived that PCPs were not aware how behavioral health  		services such as case management and peer services could provide support for  		consumers they jointly serve.</p>
<h3>F. Consumers' Views on the Integration of Physical  		Health and Behavioral Health</h3>
<p><b>Consumers were receptive to receiving services from the nurse but  		differed in their perspectives regarding sharing medical information with case  		managers and peer specialists</b>. Consumer input was incorporated into program  		development during the planning process through state and regional-wide member  		advisory groups that CCBH convened. Consumers in the focus groups were  		uniformly positive about working with the nurse both individually and in  		groups. They especially enjoyed the group education sessions on nutrition and  		diet. Several consumers also noted that they appreciated that the wellness  		nurse advocated for their needs with their PCPs. One consumer emphasized that  		the wellness nurse provided a unique service that no one else at the agency  		could provide.</p>
<p>A few consumers noted that they were reluctant to disclose physical  		health information to their case managers. These consumers either viewed their  		physical health information as personal or preferred not to impose an  		additional burden on their case managers. Case managers confirmed this  		impression, noting that some consumers questioned why they would address a  		physical health goal with their case manager; according to case managers, in  		such instances, consumers did not view knowledge of their physical health  		information as within the purview of their case manager's/social worker's role.  		Even though some consumers indicated that they viewed case managers as helping  		them only with mental health issues and transportation, others welcomed and  		expected their case managers to communicate with other agency staff about their  		goals (including physical health goals).</p>

<p>Developing a service setting that integrates primary care and behavioral  		health services is a long-term process that requires substantial investment in  		staff training and commitment to change (Heath et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2012).  		This study highlighted the key successes of the agencies in incorporating  		wellness coaching into their regular routines and integrating registered nurses  		into agency functions. As expected with these types of interventions the first  		year of implementation brought several challenges. These included staff role  		confusion, difficulty in establishing new procedures and communication  		protocols among staff members, discomfort among case managers and peer  		specialists regarding their ability to identify and address physical health  		concerns, difficulty in engaging PCPs, and slow uptake of web-based tools for  		self-care and tracking consumer outcomes. As with the launch of other complex  		interventions, the assignment of new staff responsibilities and the adaptation  		of workflows involve trial and error (Campbell et al. 2007). As described  		above, the stakeholders involved in the effort developed several strategies to  		overcome these challenges. CCBH and its partners are currently refining the  		BHHP model and expanding it to 11 counties with grant funding from the Patient  		Centered Outcomes Research Institute.</p>
<p>Consistent with current frameworks for integrated health care, on-site  		collaboration that involves some system integration may result in tension as  		"practice boundaries loosen" (Heath et al. 2013) and new procedures are  		established. The study produced several positive outcomes that provide a  		foundation for further integration of primary care and behavioral health  		services: the development of care planning processes that incorporate physical  		and behavioral health goals, increased awareness of physical health and  		wellness among behavioral health staff and consumers, and the sharing of  		information between nurses and behavioral health staff. Moreover, agency  		leaders and CCBH created an environment that encourages problem solving aimed  		at addressing the challenges of delivering integrated care. Several of the  		factors that led to these successes--including the commitment of senior  		leaders, encouraging communication among staff, and the proximity of behavioral  		health and physical health staff--are the same factors that promote integration  		of behavioral health services within primary care settings (Kirchner et al.  		2004; Valenstein et al. 1999). </p>
<p>Although the adaptation of interventions to the specific contexts of the  		service environment and community is not unique to behavioral health  		(Damschroder et al. 2009; Greenhalgh et al. 2004), some characteristics of the  		intervention and target population may have posed challenges during the process  		of adaptation. First, the identification and referral of consumers with  		physical health needs was left to the discretion of nurses, case managers, and  		peer specialists. Given their lack of medical training, case managers and peer  		specialists were reluctant to fulfill their roles without clearly specified  		guidelines. Access to formal procedures and tools would help them function as  		wellness coaches. Second, agencies exercised latitude in the extent to which  		they incorporated peer specialists into wellness planning, leading to some role  		confusion and possibly missed opportunities for peer specialists to engage  		consumers in wellness planning and physical health care. Behavioral health  		agencies often struggle with defining the role of peer specialists (Repper and  		Carter 2011) and may benefit from identifying strategies for better  		incorporating them into treatment planning and wellness activities. Finally,  		the role and functions of each nurse differed at the two agencies. Given that  		some case managers felt uncomfortable engaging consumers in physical health  		care and that some consumers felt uncomfortable disclosing medical information  		to case managers, it is essential to grant agencies flexibility to determine  		which staff function in the role of assisting consumers with medical  		appointments. To mitigate role confusion, programs may benefit from providing  		guidance on the roles and responsibilities of team members well before program  		implementation. Providing such direction must be balanced with an overly  		prescriptive approach that would otherwise dissuade agencies from taking  		ultimate ownership of a program or would discourage them from adopting care  		integration strategies. </p>
<p>The web portal was an innovative approach to help track progress toward  		reaching wellness goals, but the use of the portal was more modest than  		expected. Similar to other efforts that have sought to use web-based systems  		and patient portals to promote self-care (Goel et al. 2011; Sarkar et al.  		2011), some of the staff and/or consumers reported lack of access to a computer  		or the Internet as well as a lack of interest in using the portal. Outside the  		realm of behavioral health, other efforts to encourage the use of web portals  		have found that patients may require considerable orientation to the portal and  		may worry that the use of technology will erode their relationships with  		providers (Zickmund et al. 2008). Some studies have revealed that only  		one-third of individuals with SMI use the Internet and that, among those, only  		half is accustomed to seeking online health information (Borzekowski et al.  		2009), suggesting that consumers may need ongoing support and encouragement to  		use the web portal. Although further research is needed to understand more  		fully the strengths and limitations of computer-assisted self-care for the SMI  		population, some promising web-based programs designed to promote  		self-monitoring of symptoms and functioning for this population may provide  		models for other interventions (Välimäki et al. 2008; Rotondi et al.  		2007).</p>
<p>Finally, the agencies' rural location posed barriers to engaging  		consumers in wellness activities and physical health care. Case managers often  		met consumers in their homes or elsewhere in the community; in rural areas,  		case managers were not likely to engage as many consumers as in other areas  		because of the distance between consumers' homes. Further, the amount of time  		required to travel between consumers' homes limited nurses' ability to conduct  		home visits. In addition, counties facing budget shortfalls have reduced or  		eliminated public transportation options. </p>
<h2><a name="implication" id="implication">V. IMPLICATIONS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH  		SERVICES</a></h2>
<p>Agencies that adopt an approach to integration similar to that reviewed  		here should be mindful that, in this case study, successful implementation  		depended on: (1) establishing a systematic approach to identifying consumers  		with physical health or wellness needs; (2) providing clear guidance on staff  		roles and responsibilities; (3) prioritizing time for case managers, peer  		specialists, and nurses to engage in ongoing training and take advantage of  		opportunities for regular communication; (4) ensuring that changes in job  		responsibilities are integrated into existing workflows; and (5) having strong  		leadership support. </p>
<p>The findings from the study suggest that, in the case of these two  		counties, case managers and peer specialists could have benefited from  		structured guidance on when and how to refer consumers to nurses and how to  		support consumers in their efforts to reach their wellness goals. Case managers  		might adopt new responsibilities that both fit into their existing workflows  		and do not substantially reduce their productivity. Engaging case managers  		early in discussions about their expanded roles--well before the agency  		conducts initial training or makes changes to existing processes--can  		facilitate their buy-in and potentially identify efficient ways to integrate  		their new responsibilities. Focus groups or informal discussions with case  		managers and peer specialists could provide opportunities to solicit input on  		the feasibility of their assuming responsibility for wellness coaching.  		Clarifying role functions and expectations through a process of engaging staff  		in decision making about their jobs is essential to successful program  		implementation (Fixen et al. 2005). </p>
<p>Behavioral health agencies integrating nurses into their staff would  		benefit from direction at the program's outset on how to prioritize nurse  		activities. In particular, nurses can play a unique role as a clinical bridge  		to PCPs and specialists because they and PCPs speak a common language.  		Experienced nurse care managers at behavioral health managed care organizations  		can assist agencies in identifying the appropriate roles for a nurse operating  		within the behavioral health setting. Hiring nurses from a large hospital  		system that serves the majority of an agency's consumers seems to have  		benefited the program by allowing the nurses access to clinical information in  		real time. Further research is needed to understand whether and how access to  		clinical information influences consumer outcomes.</p>
<p>It is important for agencies implementing a new program to establish  		structured and regular opportunities for staff members to meet to ask  		questions, clarify roles, discuss whether new processes are working as  		intended, and share common challenges and solutions. Such communication  		facilitates teamwork and ensures that consistent messages are conveyed to  		consumers. Examples include the participation of the wellness nurse in weekly  		case manager meetings and daily supervisor meetings, thereby helping build  		rapport and open communication across staff members, and the institution of  		cross-department management meetings to encourage collaboration and information  		sharing. Meetings at all staff levels might also improve the consistency and  		quality of care across the agency, both vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p>Consumer input is critical during planning and implementation of  		integration efforts. Obtaining consumer input on an ongoing basis during  		implementation may especially benefit at least two aspects of similar programs  		in the future--use of the web portal and interdisciplinary care team meetings.  		Developers of web-based applications and web portals targeted to individuals  		with SMI have noted the importance of engaging consumers in design choices  		(Välimäki et al. 2008) and have documented that typical web layouts  		are often incompatible with how individuals with cognitive differences process  		information (Rotondi et al. 2007). Gathering input on the usability of the web  		portal as the intervention progresses may facilitate making adjustments to  		increase its use. In addition, consumers who participated in the focus groups  		welcomed and, in some cases expected, all staff involved in their care to meet  		jointly to discuss their care plans. Such consumer input may have signaled to  		the agencies the need for formally instituting interdisciplinary care team  		meetings, especially for those with complex needs. Implementing  		interdisciplinary care team meetings early in program implementation also could  		have facilitated communication among agency staff members and the nurse about  		their respective roles in working with consumers.</p>
<p>Behavioral health agencies need ways of systematically monitoring  		processes associated with integration activities and the outcomes of those  		activities. Process measures--such as the number of referrals made to the  		nurse, contacts with consumers by staff members, the implementation of wellness  		plans or goals, and so on--can help identify whether staff members understand  		and follow established processes (for example, are the number of referrals and  		contacts within the expected range based on the level of staff activity?) and  		whether the processes seem to work as intended or need to be adjusted (for  		example, do the number of nurse contacts with consumers align with the number  		of referrals?). Outcomes--for example, improvements in functioning and quality  		of life, weight loss or maintenance, and reductions in emergency department use  		or hospitalizations--can help agencies assess whether the program is producing  		the intended effect on consumers and whether the processes in place lead to  		improved outcomes. </p>
<p>The early implementation experiences of the behavioral health agencies  		in this study provide valuable information for the consideration of program  		developers, state officials, and policymakers seeking to integrate care for  		individuals with SMI. Findings suggest that training case managers to function  		as wellness coaches, integrating a nurse into a behavioral health agency,  		implementing web-based health assessment tools for people with SMI, and  		partnering with PCPs require a significant culture shift for both providers and  		consumers. Early implementation of BHHP highlights the importance of adequate  		planning to clarify staff roles and responsibilities and to implement effective  		communication strategies; obtaining input from consumers and staff to guide  		program development; committing to ongoing training; and developing mechanisms  		to track integration activities and consumer outcomes.</p>
