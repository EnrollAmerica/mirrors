<h3>A. Background</h3>
<p>The main goal of this study was to examine how patient, provider,  		agency, and market/regulatory factors relate to variations in home health care  		practices and how practice patterns relate to outcomes for Medicare  		beneficiaries. Five important aspects of home health practice, covering both  		direct care provision and care coordination, were selected for examination. The  		four measures of direct care investigated were (1) the average number of visits  		provided to a patient per day (i.e., visit intensity), (2) the duration of the  		home health episode (length of stay), (3) the total number of disciplines  		involved in patient care, and (4) the number of alternative services provided  		during the episode of care.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> The amount of feedback received by the primary  		home care provider from other agency personnel regarding a patient's care plan  		and discharge was examined as a measure of care coordination.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> The three key research questions  		were:</p>
<ol><li>What is the actual practice of home health care, in terms of type,  		  amount, and decision making (e.g., care planning, care coordination)?</li>
<li>How are decisions about care made in light of Medicare coverage  		  rules?</li>
<li>What elements of practice are associated with long lengths of stay in  		  the Medicare home health benefit?</li>
</ol><p>In addition, although the study was not originally intended to address  		issues related to the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, the timing of the  		project allowed for an examination of the impact of the Interim Payment System  		(IPS) and other policy changes that occurred prior to the implementation of the  		Medicare home health Prospective Payment System (PPS) in October 2000. </p>
<p>The objective of this report is to summarize the findings from the  		quantitative and qualitative methods used to answer the key study questions.  		The report provides a description of the states, agencies, and patients that  		participated in the study. Quantitative data are used to (1) examine the  		influence of patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors on  		practice patterns, (2) explore the impact of practice patterns on length of  		stay, and (3) identify the effect of practice patterns on patient outcomes.  		Practice patterns and decision making in home health care are explored using  		data from focus group and case study interviews. Finally, qualitative data  		regarding provider perspectives on IPS, a major provision of the BBA, and other  		changes in the field of home health care are summarized.</p>
<h3>B. Findings</h3>
<h4>1. Key Features of Study States, Agencies, and  		Patients</h4>
<p><i><strong>Study States</strong></i>: Eight states were chosen for  		participation in the study on the basis of their home health visit volume,  		defined as the average number of visits per Medicare beneficiary receiving home  		care per year in 1995. Four low-volume and four high-volume states were  		selected. The four low-volume states selected were Minnesota, New Jersey,  		Oregon, and Pennsylvania and the four high-volume states were Georgia,  		Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Texas.</p>
<p>Descriptive information about the states shows variation within each  		state volume group, but greater variation between the two groups. Further,  		although visit volume (visits per beneficiary per year) has decreased in both  		the low- and high-volume states, the percentage reduction in visit volume is  		only slightly higher in high-volume states than low-volume states. Some key  		differences between the states in the high-and low-volume groups are the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>On average, a slightly larger percentage of the population is 65  		  years old or older in the low-volume than the high-volume states.</li>
<li>In low-volume states, a slightly smaller percentage of the age 65 and  		  older population lives in poverty than in the high-volume states. Likewise, a  		  smaller percentage of Medicare patients are covered by Medicaid in the  		  low-volume than the high-volume states. </li>
<li>A larger number of people aged 65 and older per 1000 has difficulties  		  with mobility/self-care in the high-volume than the low-volume states.</li>
<li>The high-volume study states have many more home health users per  		  1000 among their Medicare beneficiaries than do the low-volume states.</li>
</ul><p><i><strong>Study Agencies</strong></i>: Agencies were randomly sampled  		from the eight states and invited to participate in the study until the target  		agency sample of 56 agencies was reached. During the course of data collection,  		several agencies discontinued their participation in the study (often due to  		the greater financial stringency under IPS) or failed to submit useable  		longitudinal data. Of the 56 agencies recruited for participation in the study,  		44 contributed data to the final sample used for analysis purposes.</p>
<p>The study agencies reflected a variety of important agency-level  		factors, providing a cross-section with regard to three factors that were  		hypothesized to play a critical role in the practice of home health care: </p>
<ul><li>The final sample of 44 agencies had good representation of agencies  		  in both the high-volume and low-volume states (41% and 59%, respectively).</li>
<li>More than half of the agencies were nonproprietary or government  		  agencies (66%). The remaining 34% were proprietary agencies.</li>
<li>The sample had nearly equal representation of hospital-based and  		  freestanding agencies (48% and 52%, respectively). </li>
</ul><p><strong><i>Study Patients</i></strong>: The final patient sample  		included 684 patients, contributing a total of 732 complete episodes of care.  		Patients enrolled in the study reflected a variety of important variations in  		their conditions and living situations.</p>
<ul><li>The study patients were quite elderly, with an average age of 78  		  years.</li>
<li>The majority of patients were White and female.</li>
<li>Despite their age, 80% of the study patients lived in their own  		  homes.</li>
<li>Nearly all patients had family members or other persons who provided  		  them with some assistance.</li>
<li>Slightly over 81% of patients had been discharged from an inpatient  		  facility within two weeks of beginning home care.</li>
<li>The majority of patients (95%) had only a single episode of care  		  during their time in the study.</li>
</ul><h4>2. Practice Variations in Home Health Care</h4>
<p>Quantitative analyses were conducted on longitudinal data for congestive  		heart failure (CHF) and diabetes mellitus patient episodes to examine (1) the  		effect of patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors on home care  		practices, (2) the influence of practice patterns on episode length, and (3)  		the impact of home care practices on patient outcome. The following are the key  		findings from the multivariate analyses:</p>
<ul><li>Patient complexity, functional status, and diagnoses were important  		  predictors of visit frequency, the number of disciplines and alternative  		  services included in the patient's care, episode length, and the amount of  		  feedback a care provider receives from other agency personnel about the  		  patient's care plan. </li>
<li>Care providers with more years of experience in home health care  		  tended to have patients with significantly longer episode lengths than did less  		  experienced providers. </li>
<li>Agency ownership and type were strong predictors of home care  		  practices. Proprietary agencies appeared to counterbalance visit intensity and  		  length of stay, providing their patients with more frequent visits over shorter  		  episodes than did nonproprietary agencies. These agencies also made greater use  		  of alternative services.</li>
<li>Freestanding agencies provided both more frequent visits and longer  		  episodes of care than did hospital-based agencies.</li>
<li>States that had been identified based on 1995 data as providing a  		  large number of home care visits per patient appeared to continue to utilize  		  home care resources more heavily than did states with lower visit volume (e.g.,  		  more frequent visits, more disciplines involved).</li>
<li>Agencies appeared to counterbalance frequency of visits and length of  		  stay, such that episodes involving more frequent visits were significantly  		  shorter than episodes with less frequent visits. </li>
<li>Episodes of care that involved more disciplines were significantly  		  longer than those involving fewer home health disciplines.</li>
<li>Patients receiving more frequent visits experienced marginally better  		  outcomes of home care than did patients with less frequent visits.</li>
</ul><h4>3. What is the Actual Practice of Home Health Care?</h4>
<p>The focus group and case study interviews were conducted to examine home  		health care in greater depth than was possible with the primary data sample.  		Key findings regarding service provision, and care planning and coordination  		are summarized here.</p>
<p><i><strong>Service Provision</strong></i>: </p>
<ul><li>Often, elderly recipients of Medicare home care services are complex  		  patients, many having been recently discharged from hospital care. According to  		  focus group participants, patients just released from the hospital often are  		  sicker than other home care recipients and frequently require complex or  		  high-tech services. </li>
<li>Home care nurses engage in a wide variety of activities as part of  		  providing skilled nursing care, including assessment of patients' medical  		  conditions and needs, education of patients and their families, development of  		  the care plan, management of the medications, completion of required forms,  		  documentation, coordination of the patients' support networks, psychological  		  counseling, and coordination of care across disciplines.</li>
<li>The family support system is of great importance to elderly home care  		  patients. Family members provide assistance with activities of daily living  		  (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), environmental support,  		  and psychological support. In addition, they often are heavily involved in the  		  patients' home health care activities (e.g., present at visits, involved in the  		  development of the plan of care). The presence of a family support system is an  		  important factor affecting nurses' decisions about the frequency of visits a  		  patient needs.</li>
<li>Patients and/or their families often refuse to accept the services of  		  home health aides and medical social workers. Usually, patients who refuse  		  services have family members who are willing and able to provide for the  		  patients' needs.</li>
</ul><p>	<i><strong>Care Planning and Coordination</strong></i>:</p>
<ul><li>The role of the primary nurse in the process of developing the  		  patient's care plan varies from agency to agency. At some of the case study  		  agencies, primary nurses have a great deal of control over a patient's care  		  plan. However, many agencies involve nursing supervisors in the development of  		  patients' care plans. Although the sample size was small, the case study  		  interviews suggest that primary nurses have greater control over the  		  development of their patients' care plans in low-volume states and in  		  nonproprietary agencies. Administrator Questionnaire data corroborate these  		  findings and also suggest that primary nurses have greater control over their  		  patients' care plans in hospital-based than freestanding agencies.</li>
<li>Physician involvement in home care appears to be minimal in most  		  cases. Generally, the patient's plan of care is developed independently by home  		  care agency staff based on their initial assessment of the patient's needs. The  		  care plan often has little resemblance to the physician's initial referral,  		  which rarely specifies the types of visits needed and the frequency with which  		  they should occur. Nurses usually communicate with their patients' physicians  		  only at milestone time points, such as recertification and discharge, or when  		  the patient's condition changes. Contact between home care nurses and  		  physicians is nearly always made indirectly through the physician's nursing  		  staff.</li>
<li>Home health agency case conferences are a main mechanism through  		  which home care providers of different disciplines stay in contact about their  		  patients. </li>
<li>Discharge planning begins very early in the home care episode, often  		  at the first visit. Nurses cited a number of factors they consider in  		  determining a patient's readiness for discharge: homebound status and other  		  Medicare eligibility requirements, stability of the patient's medical condition  		  and medication regimen, attainment of educational goals, the patient's  		  endurance, and the patient's ability to manage his or her medications.</li>
<li>In preparation for discharge, primary nurses work to identify  		  resources to assist with the patient's continuing needs following discharge,  		  such as transportation and meal preparation.</li>
</ul><h4>4. How are Decisions About Care Made in Light of  		Medicare Coverage Rules?</h4>
<p>The focus group and case study interviews also provided important  		information about the decision-making process in home health care. This section  		highlights some key findings from these interviews.</p>
<ul><li>Recertification and discharge decisions are based on a number of  		  factors, including patient factors (e.g., living environment), agency factors  		  (e.g., supervision of decision-making process), and external factors (e.g.,  		  IPS, coverage rules).</li>
<li>The patient's primary nurse usually makes the decisions about the  		  care plan, although some agencies involve nursing supervisors and a  		  multi-disciplinary team in the review of each patient's care plan. Nurses in  		  low-volume states appear to have greater control over the decision-making  		  process than do nurses in high-volume states. Supervisory staff appear to be  		  more involved in the development of the patient's care plan in proprietary than  		  nonproprietary agencies.</li>
<li>There appears to be considerable confusion surrounding Medicare  		  coverage rules. Nurses often are uncertain about the definition of "homebound,"  		  about what constitutes skilled nursing care, and about the appropriate use of  		  Management and Evaluation (M&amp;E). Nurses suggested that physicians seem to  		  struggle with these concepts as well, sometimes referring patients who are not  		  eligible for Medicare home health services. </li>
<li>However, the focus group and case study interviews produced no  		  evidence that the lack of clarity in coverage rules encourages home care  		  providers to continue to provide services to patients who may be ready for  		  discharge. Indeed, there was some suggestion from the interviews that this  		  ambiguity may actually result in shorter episodes of care. Fear of Medicare  		  review leads some nurses to opt for discharging a patient for whom it is  		  unclear whether discharge or recertification is the correct approach. Further,  		  it appears that agencies may avoid the use of services for which the coverage  		  rules are ambiguous, such as M&amp;E. </li>
</ul><h4>5. Provider Perspectives on the Interim Payment System  		(IPS)</h4>
<p>This study was not originally intended to examine the impact of recent  		regulatory changes related to home health care. However, because the BBA was  		implemented prior to the major data acquisition phase of the project, the  		opportunity arose to obtain information about the impact of IPS and other  		recent changes in home health care. A number of important themes emerged across  		several methods used to examine provider perceptions of IPS and concurrent  		changes:<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>Interview participants reported that home care patients receive fewer  		  services and are on service for shorter periods of time than they once  		  were.</li>
<li>The focus on reducing home health utilization has led to the  		  identification and increased involvement of community and other outside  		  resources early in patients' episodes of care. </li>
<li>According to agency administrators, this increased emphasis on  		  community resources has expanded the role of social workers in patient care.  		  However, this finding is not consistent with recent work conducted by Abt  		  Associates (1999), which indicated that more agencies have decreased (8.4%)  		  than increased (4.2%) the involvement of social workers. </li>
<li>Patient education intended to help patients and their families to  		  provide for their own needs has become an increasingly important aspect of home  		  care. According to many providers, this education must take place in an  		  increasingly short period of time. </li>
<li>Interview participants reported that agencies sometimes refuse  		  high-need patients, such as chronic, complex, or rural patients. In particular,  		  the respondents contend that access to home care services has been reduced for  		  diabetic patients and patients who need daily wound care. Other studies have  		  reported similar findings.</li>
<li>Many interview participants noted that a large number of home care  		  agencies have closed or merged with other agencies during the past few years.  		  </li>
<li>Many agencies have instituted cost saving measures, laid off staff,  		  instituted additional case management procedures, increased nurse productivity  		  standards, and changed their geographic service areas in an attempt to respond  		  to IPS and other regulatory changes. </li>
<li>Many agencies are pursuing ways to diversify their payer sources,  		  seeking to shift their case load more toward Medicaid and managed care and away  		  from Medicare. </li>
<li>Agency administrators noted a reduction in physician referrals to  		  home care.</li>
</ul><h3>C. Conclusions</h3>
<p>The field of home health care has seen dramatic changes over the past  		several years. Since the collection of the data used in this study, several  		major regulations have been implemented that are expected to have a powerful  		impact on the practice of home health care. The implementation of the home  		health PPS in October 2000 has provided agencies with strong incentives to  		reduce the number of visits provided to patients and to find other means of  		minimizing the cost of care. These incentives have the potential to lead to  		underservice and poor patient outcomes. On the other hand, the 1999  		implementation of OASIS data collection and transmission requirements and the  		more recent generation of case mix, adverse event, and outcome reports focus  		agency attention on the quality of care they provide, perhaps lessening the  		likelihood of underutilization of care. The findings from this study provide a  		baseline of information on practice patterns during the IPS period, allowing  		researchers to identify the impact of the implementation of PPS and other  		recent federal regulations. </p>

<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3><a name="chapIA" id="chapIA">A. Background</a></h3>
<p>The growth of the elderly population and changes in Medicare policy have  		led to dramatic increases in the volume and costs of home health care during  		the late 1980s and early 1990s. In light of this recent growth, it has become  		increasingly important to understand the actual practice of home health care  		and how health care providers interpret Medicare policies. This study was  		intended to explore several important dimensions of home health care, with  		particular emphasis on the delivery and outcome of care in the context of  		current Medicare policies and regulations. The information collected in the  		study is intended to contribute to the knowledge base of government agencies in  		dealing with current and future issues surrounding home health care.</p>
<p>The main goal of this study, conducted for the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), was to examine factors related to  		variations in the care practices of Medicare-certified home health care  		providers. During the 1990s, dramatic variations in the provision of home  		health care became apparent. In 1995, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  		identified wide variation in reimbursement rates per beneficiary at agencies  		across the country (OIG 1995a). Using 1993 data, OIG found that one-third of  		all home health agencies received 51.5% of all Medicare reimbursement for home  		health services. Although the average reimbursement per visit was similar  		across agencies, the number of visits provided varied dramatically. Agencies  		with the highest level of reimbursement provided an average of five times more  		visits per beneficiary than did agencies with the lowest level of reimbursement  		(141 vs. 27 visits).</p>
<p>Agencies that received high levels of reimbursement differed from  		low-reimbursement agencies in several important respects (OIG 1995a). Agencies  		with high reimbursement levels tended to be proprietary and freestanding.  		Further, these agencies had larger numbers of employees, especially home health  		aides, than did agencies with lower reimbursement rates per beneficiary.  		Agencies with high reimbursement rates provided seven times the number of home  		health aide visits than did agencies with lower average per-beneficiary  		reimbursement.</p>
<p>Large differences in average reimbursement rates per beneficiary did not  		seem to be explained by patient characteristics (OIG 1995a). A comparison of  		reimbursement rates for the 15 principal diagnostic codes with the highest  		reimbursement amounts indicated that average reimbursement rates per  		beneficiary varied dramatically even within specific diagnostic groups.  		Further, beneficiary age, gender, race, and Medicare-eligibility category were  		quite similar across agencies of varying reimbursement levels. Contrary to what  		one might expect, patients in the care of high-reimbursement agencies were  		slightly more likely to die while on service than were patients in the care of  		agencies with lower levels of reimbursement per beneficiary. However, this  		difference was quite small and might suggest that high-reimbursement agencies  		care for patients with more severe illness.</p>
<p>OIG also examined the relationship between average reimbursement per  		beneficiary and quality of care (1995a). In the absence of true outcome  		measures, agency-level measures were used as proxies for service quality (i.e.,  		number of deficiencies and complaints recorded by the Health Care Financing  		Administration (HCFA) Survey and Certification Branch and accreditation  		status).<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Agencies with  		high reimbursement rates per beneficiary did not have fewer deficiencies and  		complaints than agencies with lower average reimbursement rates per  		beneficiary. They were, however, less likely to be accredited (this may be  		related to the fact that these agencies are less likely to be affiliated with  		hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or other medical service  		organizations).</p>
<p>In 1994, Schore found striking regional variations in the use of home  		health services. Examining utilization of home health services in nine  		multi-state regions, corresponding to regional categories typically used by  		HCFA, Schore found that the mean number of visits provided per home care  		episode was much lower in the Pacific region (Alaska, California, Hawaii,  		Oregon, and Washington) and Middle Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and  		Pennsylvania) than in the East South Central and West South Central regions  		(East: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee; West: Arkansas,  		Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). The mean numbers of visits per episode were 28  		in the Pacific region and 30 in the Middle Atlantic region. In the East and  		West South Central regions, on the other hand, the mean numbers of visits per  		home health episode were 95 and 64, respectively. Regional variations in  		episode length followed this same pattern. The Pacific and Middle Atlantic  		regions had much shorter mean lengths of stay in the home health benefit (60  		and 66 days, respectively) than did the East and West South Central regions  		(180 and 121 days, respectively). OIG (1995b) also reported that states in the  		Southeastern region of the country (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,  		Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) provide more visits  		per beneficiary than other states.</p>
<p>According to Schore (1994), the types of visits provided also varied  		somewhat by geographic region. Although there was little regional variability  		in the inclusion of skilled nursing visits in the episodes of care, the  		inclusion of home health aide visits, therapy visits, and social work visits  		was subject to greater regional variability. Home health aides provided at  		least one visit in 37% of the episodes in the Pacific region and 52% in the  		East South Central region. The percentages of episodes in a region that  		included at least one therapy visit ranged from 26% (West North Central region:  		Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) to  		46% (Pacific region). Medical social workers provided at least one visit in 8%  		of the episodes of care in the New England region (Connecticut, Maine,  		Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) and 32% of the  		episodes in the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Importantly, in the Schore study (1994), patient outcomes (measured  		through claims data) appeared to vary somewhat by geographic region. Patients  		in the Pacific region had the lowest rates of inpatient admission within 30  		days of the end of their home health episodes, home health readmission between  		31 and 60 days after the end of their episodes, and home health readmission  		between 31 and 60 days after the end of their episodes for the same diagnostic  		group as the original episode. Patients in the East South Central region had  		the highest rates of these outcomes and also the highest death rate within 30  		days of the end of a home health episode.</p>
<p>Schore's results (1994) suggest that high utilization does not  		necessarily enhance patient outcomes, as one might expect. On the contrary, the  		region with the highest utilization rates had the highest occurrence of  		negative outcomes on four of the six outcome measures, whereas the region with  		the lowest utilization had the lowest occurrence of three of the six outcomes.  		However, it is clear from this study that the characteristics of home health  		markets, agencies, and patients in these different regions were quite distinct.  		The South Central agencies tended to operate in nonmetropolitan areas with high  		rates of poverty and few alternative resources. A large proportion of the home  		health episodes in these regions were provided by proprietary and freestanding  		agencies. Agencies in the Pacific and Middle Atlantic regions were more likely  		to be located in large metropolitan areas where the elderly population was less  		impoverished and alternative resources were more widely available. Most of the  		episodes of care in these regions were provided by non-proprietary home health  		agencies. </p>
<p>Further, the two South Central regions, both of which had high  		utilization rates, appeared to have a particularly frail and chronically ill  		patient population. Agencies in the Pacific and Middle Atlantic regions, on the  		other hand, appeared to serve more post-acute care patients and fewer  		chronically ill patients. As a result of this variability in agency and patient  		characteristics, it appeared that agencies in the South Central regions were  		using home health care as a type of long-term care, providing relatively  		extensive home health aide services and relatively few therapy services, to a  		caseload of very frail patients. The Pacific and Middle Atlantic regions, on  		the other hand, used the home health benefit mainly for short-term  		rehabilitation following acute care. Patients in these regions received  		relatively more therapy and social work visits than patients in other regions.  		However, even after controlling for patient and agency characteristics (e.g.,  		type of control), regional variation in home health utilization remained.</p>
<p>Together, the reports prepared by OIG (1995a) and Schore (1994)  		demonstrated striking variations in the utilization of home health care  		services across the country. According to these studies, certain patient,  		agency, and market characteristics influence the use of home health care.  		Although, this OIG report suggested that patient characteristics such as age,  		gender, and race had little association with utilization rates, Schore reported  		that race and certain diagnostic categories were related to an increase in the  		number of visits provided. Both studies demonstrated an association between  		high utilization and certain agency characteristics (i.e., proprietary control,  		freestanding type). Further, the findings from the Schore study suggest that  		certain characteristics of the local health care markets influence the  		utilization of home health care (i.e., poverty rate, alternative resources  		available, urban/rural nature of community). Both studies report a paradoxical  		relationship between utilization and outcomes. In the Schore report, low-use  		regions had fewer inpatient admissions, home health readmissions, and  		post-discharge deaths than did high-use regions. Similarly, the OIG report  		found a slight inverse relationship between average reimbursement rates per  		beneficiary and patient death while on service, although this indicator was not  		intended as an outcome measure. Further, the authors of the OIG report  		indicated that agencies with higher average reimbursement rates per beneficiary  		were less likely to be accredited, a proxy measure of service quality, than  		were agencies with lower reimbursement rates.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered regarding practice variations in home  		health care. Because the OIG (1995a) and Schore (1994) studies were based  		entirely on secondary data, they were limited in the kinds of relationships  		that could be explored and the kinds of conclusions that could be drawn.  		Neither project was able to identify causal relationships between patient,  		agency, and market characteristics and practice patterns, nor between practice  		patterns and patient outcomes. Further, the data with which patient and agency  		characteristics and patient outcomes could be examined were limited. For  		example, patient characteristics that might have a powerful influence on home  		health utilization, such as specific details about the patient's medical  		condition, his or her ability to learn, compliance with the medical regimen,  		assistance provided by the family support system, and willingness to accept  		certain home health services, are not accessible through secondary data  		sources. Information about agency-specific policies, such as case management,  		supervision of nursing decisions, and productivity standards, also are not  		readily available. Further, these studies were able to examine the outcomes or  		quality of care only to a limited degree.</p>
<p>The current study was designed to examine practice variations in home  		health care through the collection of primary longitudinal data.  		<a href="#figure1.1">Figure 1.1</a> presents the conceptual framework for the  		study. In Stage 1, several sets of independent variables (patient, provider,  		agency, and market/regulatory factors) are hypothesized to influence practice  		patterns. In Stage 2, practice patterns are hypothesized to affect patient  		outcomes. The main emphasis in this study was on Stage 1, although quantitative  		analyses were conducted to examine how variations in practice patterns relate  		to patient outcomes (after controlling for patient, provider, agency, and  		market/regulatory factors). </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1.1" id="figure1.1"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/65036/epicfig1.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Three main research questions were identified for the study:</p>
<ol><li>What is the actual practice of home health care, in terms of type,  		  amount, and decision making (e.g., care planning, care coordination)? </li>
<li>How are decisions about care made in light of Medicare coverage  		  rules?</li>
<li>What elements of practice are associated with long lengths of stay in  		  the Medicare home health benefit?</li>
</ol><p>The first question focuses on the direct care Medicare home care  		patients receive, such as the number and frequency of skilled nurse and home  		health aide visits, the types of services provided during a skilled nursing  		visit (e.g., teaching, assessment), and the amount and type of care planning  		and coordination organized by the home care provider. Of particular importance  		is how such practice patterns are related to patient, provider, agency, and  		market/regulatory factors. To answer the second question, methods were  		developed to examine care provider variation in interpretation of Medicare home  		health care coverage rules (e.g., the definition of homebound status and the  		need for skilled care), and to investigate how care providers interpret  		coverage rules when making decisions to discharge or recertify patients in  		situations in which either choice may be reasonable. Finally, the third  		question focuses on identifying care provider practices that relate to shorter  		versus longer lengths of stay for similar patients (e.g., amount of teaching,  		coordination of alternative or community services to assist the patient, care  		planning with physicians). An important issue associated with all three  		questions is whether practice differences are related to differences in patient  		outcomes. Thus, the linkage between practice patterns and outcomes was also  		explored in the study.</p>
<p>A study of practice patterns in home health care is particularly  		important at this time in view of the major changes that have occurred over the  		past several years in the utilization of Medicare home health services, as well  		as in government policies designed to constrain spending on Medicare home  		health care. Several factors have resulted in an increase in the magnitude and  		cost of the Medicare home health benefit. In 1980, the Omnibus Reconciliation  		Act (P.L. 96-499) eliminated the limit on the number of visits a home care  		patient could receive each year (U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] 1999).  		Further, after the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for acute care hospitals  		was implemented in 1984, Medicare spending on home health services began to  		increase dramatically (Liu, Harvell &amp; Gage 2000; Schore 1994). Since the  		hospital PPS provides hospitals with the incentive to reduce the lengths of  		their patients' inpatient stays, many patients who might have spent additional  		time in the hospital prior to PPS began to be discharged to their homes and to  		home health care services instead. </p>
<p>Utilization of Medicare home health services also increased as a result  		of the 1988 lawsuit, Duggan vs. Bowan, which prompted the clarification of  		Medicare home health regulations and the broadening of eligibility criteria for  		the Medicare home health benefit. Among other changes that resulted from Duggan  		vs. Bowan, a patient with a chronic disease or long-term care needs could no  		longer be denied Medicare home health coverage so long as he or she had a  		demonstrated need for skilled care (Schore 1994). </p>
<p>Other factors contributed to the increase in home health utilization.  		Agencies' increased ability to provide high-technology care, such as infusion  		therapy, parenteral nutrition, and ventilator care, increased the number of  		patients they were able to serve. As well, according to GAO, many states  		instituted Medicare maximization policies designed to encourage providers to  		utilize the Medicare home health benefit for dually eligible home care  		recipients (GAO 1998). Finally, many believe that Medicare reimbursement  		policy, by which agencies were paid on the basis of their costs up to  		pre-established limits for each visit type, did not provide agencies with any  		incentive to provide care in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>Although the number of home health claims increased dramatically as a  		result of these factors, Medicare oversight of home care agencies did not.  		Between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of claims that were reviewed dropped from  		approximately 12% to 2%, although the number of claims nearly tripled (GAO  		1999). The reduction in oversight of home health agencies may have contributed  		to the number of inaccurate and fraudulent claims filed. </p>
<p>Together, these factors dramatically increased the number of home care  		providers as well as Medicare home health expenditures. Between 1989 and 1996,  		Medicare home health expenditures rose from $2.5 billion to $16.8 billion (GAO  		1998). During this same time period, the number of certified home health care  		agencies grew from approximately 5,700 to more than 10,000. According to OIG  		(1999a), the increase in the number of agencies was concentrated among certain  		agency types. The number of freestanding and urban agencies doubled, and the  		number of proprietary agencies tripled. The increase in Medicare home health  		expenditures during the early 1990s was due largely to the increase in the  		number of users and visits per user (Komisar &amp; Feder 1998). The duration of  		home health episodes also increased. Whereas 14% of home care episodes lasted  		166 days or more in 1990, 20% lasted 166 days or more in 1995 (OIG 1999a).</p>
<p>The provision of home care services that did not meet Medicare coverage  		and/or eligibility rules and fraudulent billing practices contributed to the  		tremendous increase in Medicare home health care expenditures during the 1980s  		and 1990s. Beginning in 1995, the anti-fraud initiative Operation Restore Trust  		(ORT) was implemented to address concerns over growing Medicare expenditures  		for home health care, nursing home care, hospice care, and durable medical  		equipment (OIG 1997b). ORT focused on five states (California, Florida,  		Illinois, New York, and Texas) that account for a large percentage of the  		nation's Medicare population. In a 1997 audit of home health claims in four of  		these states (all but Florida), OIG estimated that 40% of services billed in a  		sample of Medicare home health claims did not meet Medicare reimbursement  		requirements. The majority of these improperly billed services were deemed not  		to be reasonable and necessary, were for patients that were not homebound, or  		were not accompanied by valid physician orders. OIG estimated that Medicare  		expenditures for these unallowable claims totaled $2.6 billion, approximately  		38.8% of the entire Medicare expenditures for home health care in these four  		states.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>According to another OIG report (1997a), more than 25% of the home  		health agencies in the five ORT states were "problem providers" (i.e., they had  		abused or defrauded Medicare or misappropriated Medicare funds). These problem  		agencies received nearly 45% of all Medicare home health care expenditures in  		these five states. Although 50% of the nation's Medicare-certified home health  		care agencies were proprietary, 80% of the problem agencies were proprietary.  		The average reimbursement per patient for these agencies was nearly 50% more  		than the average reimbursement per patient for non-proprietary problem  		agencies.</p>
<p>To stem the dramatic rise in Medicare home health care expenditures,  		both those resulting from legitimate increases in utilization and those  		resulting from fraud and abuse, the Federal Government implemented new  		regulations to control home health expenditures and to improve the oversight of  		the home health industry. As mentioned previously, the anti-fraud initiative  		ORT was implemented in 1995 in the five states with the largest share of the  		Medicare beneficiary population. Agencies providing an unusually large number  		of Medicare services were reviewed to identify improper and/or fraudulent home  		health claims (GAO 1999). In 1997, ORT was expanded to include 12 additional  		states as well as additional care providers (e.g., psychiatric hospitals). In  		the same year, the Wedge Project was established in 14 high-utilization states  		to identify invalid claims and to recover Medicare funds. Also in 1997,  		Medicare participation rules were revised to screen out agencies that might  		become problem providers (GAO 1999; OIG 1999a). The Health Insurance  		Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, P.L. 104-191), which was implemented  		in August 1996, established a monetary penalty for any physician who falsely  		certifies the need for Medicare-covered home health services. </p>
<p>Of particular interest in this study are changes in home care resulting  		from the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (P.L. 105-33). This legislation  		incorporated a number of cost-containment measures for home care, with the goal  		of reducing home care expenditures by $16 billion over a five-year period  		(1998-2002). The major provisions of the BBA related to home health care are  		summarized in <a href="#table1.1">Table 1.1</a>. In an attempt to reduce the  		utilization of home health services, the legislation mandated the transition  		from a cost-based system of payment for home health care to a prospective  		payment structure. The BBA resulted in the implementation of the Interim  		Payment System (IPS) and laid the foundation for the PPS for home health care.  		</p>
<p>IPS was the system of payment for home health services that was designed  		to be in effect from the time the BBA was passed to the time PPS went into  		effect. Its major component was a new annual per-beneficiary reimbursement  		limit that was based on 1994 visits per-beneficiary data. This limit placed  		stringent reimbursement constraints on most home health providers. The BBA also  		constrained and clarified home health eligibility criteria. Patients with the  		need for venipuncture services only were no longer considered eligible for  		Medicare home health services. In addition, the BBA clarified coverage  		requirements for part-time or intermittent nursing care and home health aide  		services.</p>
<p>In each year following the implementation of IPS, actual reductions in  		home health expenditures exceeded the projected reductions. According to  		estimates generated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), spending on  		Medicare home health services declined by nearly 45% between 1997 and 1999  		(NAHC 2000). Primarily for this reason, subsequent legislation was passed that  		provided some relief to home health care agencies. <a href="#table1.1">Table  		1.1</a> identifies major amendments that have occurred to the original  		provisions of the BBA.</p>

</tr></table><p> Although this study was not originally intended to address issues  		related to the BBA, the timing of the project allowed for an examination of the  		impact of recent policy changes on the field of home health care. For instance,  		the decrease in the per-visit cost limits and the addition of per-beneficiary  		limits under IPS have affected many home health agencies. Information on care  		practices under IPS can provide a baseline for later assessments of the impacts  		of PPS, implemented in the Fall of 2000 (HCFA 1999b). </p>
<h3><a name="chapIB" id="chapIB">B. Overview of Methods</a></h3>
<p> This section provides a brief overview of the methods used in the  		study. Detailed information about the research design is presented in  		<a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a>. </p>
<h4>1. State, Agency, and Patient Selection</h4>
<p> Because a major dimension on which home care practice varies is visit  		volume per home health care user, the main study sample was designed to include  		a substantial degree of variation in visit volume. The 48 contiguous states  		were categorized by volume based on the average number of visits per Medicare  		beneficiary. Those states in the highest and lowest quartiles with regard to  		volume were identified. Four states from the high-volume (Georgia,  		Massachusetts, Mississippi, Texas) and four states from the low-volume  		quartiles (Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania) were chosen as the  		focus of the study. </p>
<p> According to the agency sampling protocol described in  		<a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a>, 56 home health care agencies were recruited to  		participate in the study. Twenty-nine of these agencies were located in the  		four low-volume states and 27 agencies were located in the four high-volume  		states. Clinical staff at each of the 56 recruited agencies received training  		regarding data collection instruments and protocols. Training took place on  		site at each agency and was conducted by a nurse researcher from the Center for  		Health Policy Research.</p>
<p> During the course of data collection, several agencies discontinued  		their participation in the study. Twelve agencies formally withdrew from the  		study and an additional six agencies failed to submit useable patient data. Of  		the agencies that formally withdrew, half submitted at least some useable data  		prior to withdrawing from the study. Therefore, of the 56 agencies recruited  		for participation in the study, 44 contributed data to the final sample used  		for analysis purposes.</p>
<p> Because one of the main goals of the study was to identify practice  		patterns associated with long lengths of stay in the Medicare home health  		benefit, it was important to collect data on a patient population for which  		long home health episodes are not uncommon. For this reason, the sample was  		limited to patients having primary or secondary diagnoses of congestive heart  		failure (CHF) or diabetes mellitus. In order to be considered eligible for the  		study, a patient also had to be age 65 years or older, covered by Medicare, and  		living in the state in which his or her home care agency was located. Using  		these criteria, a total of 1,217 patients were enrolled in the study.</p>
<p> In the final patient sample, only patients with complete assessment  		data at the episode level were included. The final patient sample for the study  		included 684 patients. Of these patients, 292 were diagnosed with CHF, 246 with  		diabetes mellitus, and 146 with both conditions. Across the 684 patients,  		complete assessment data were available for 732 episodes of care.</p>
<h4>2. Quantitative and Qualitative Methods</h4>
<p> Data were collected using both quantitative and qualitative methods.  		Primary quantitative data were collected to examine patient, provider, and  		agency factors related to practice patterns and outcomes in home health care.  		Specifically, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and Care Provider  		Questionnaire (CPQ) data were collected longitudinally to assess important  		patient factors that might influence care practices and eventual patient  		outcomes. Care Provider Profile (CPP) data were collected for each home care  		provider caring for a study patient. The CPP assessed important characteristics  		of the care providers, such as years of experience and education. At the time  		each agency was recruited to participate in the study, the agency's  		administrator was asked to complete the Administrator Questionnaire (AQ). This  		instrument was designed to elicit information related to agency factors that  		may affect the practice of home health care (e.g., licensing and accreditation,  		reimbursement, caseload, changes due to venipuncture regulations, use of nurse  		productivity standards, case management and supervision). </p>
<p> Information about market/regulatory factors likely to affect practice  		patterns in home health care was obtained primarily from secondary sources.  		Although the AQ provided some market/regulatory information, other data  		relevant to market/regulatory factors were obtained through publicly available  		data sets, such as OSCAR, the Area Resource File (ARF), and through  		publications of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).</p>
<p> Practice patterns were measured primarily through billing data, which  		provided information about the number and kinds of visits conducted during an  		episode of care. Some additional practice pattern variables, such as variables  		reflecting the use of alternative resources and oversight of clinicians'  		decisions regarding patient care were calculated from CPQ data items.</p>
<p> The study also involved a number of qualitative data collection methods  		designed to address the main study questions and/or the impact of IPS and other  		policy changes. The administrators of the study agencies were interviewed to  		collect information about how IPS had affected the agencies participating in  		the study. In addition, interviews were conducted with representatives of home  		care associations in the eight study states to identify how home health care  		practices had changed in response to the implementation of IPS.</p>
<p> Focus group interviews, involving several nurses each, were conducted  		at eight agencies to explore how home care decisions are made in light of  		Medicare coverage rules. In order to assess whether the ambiguity of Medicare  		coverage rules encourages providers to increase the amount of care provided by  		lengthening patients' episodes of care, the focus groups were designed to  		facilitate discussions among home health care providers regarding the decision  		to recertify or to discharge a patient. During the focus group interviews, two  		vignettes illustrating common clinical situations were presented. The  		vignettes, which described patients for whom the appropriateness of  		recertification or discharge was somewhat unclear, provided context for  		discussing the interpretation of coverage rules and the process for justifying  		a need for home health services. In this report, data from the focus group  		interviews are used to explore the role of the following factors influencing  		the decision-making process in home health care: (1) patient and caregiver  		factors (e.g., living situation), (2) the actors involved in the  		decision-making process (e.g., nurses, physicians), (3) agency factors (e.g.,  		supervision of the decision-making process), (4) external factors (e.g.,  		managed care), and (5) Medicare coverage rules (e.g., homebound status).</p>
<p> Case study interviews, conducted with one nurse from each of seven  		agencies, were conducted to provide a description of the practice of home  		health care by exploring the treatment episodes of seven recently discharged  		patients (one per nurse). To control for practice variation due to the  		condition being treated, the case studies were limited to CHF patients. The  		information gathered during the course of the case study interviews was used to  		explore the following aspects of home health care: (1) key characteristics of  		home care episodes (e.g., length, disciplines involved), (2) services provided  		by various disciplines and the family support system, (3) care planning and  		coordination (e.g., development and documentation of the care plan), and (4)  		content of the skilled nursing visit (e.g., teaching, direct care). </p>
<p> As noted earlier, the initial design work for this study took place  		prior to the passage of the BBA and the subsequent implementation of the  		changes it mandated, such as IPS. To capture information on the impact of the  		BBA, the final design for the administrator interviews, state home care  		association interviews, focus groups, and case studies was shaped to be  		relevant under IPS and the forthcoming move to PPS. Each of these interview  		methods included components to obtain information on industry stakeholders'  		perceptions of changes in home health care provision resulting from recent  		policy changes, particularly those under the BBA. </p>
<h3><a name="chapIC" id="chapIC">C. Report Overview</a></h3>
<p> This document represents the final report for the Study of Medicare  		Home Health Practice Variations. The report presents the findings from both the  		quantitative and qualitative methods designed to answer the three key study  		questions and to examine the impact of policy changes resulting from the BBA.  		The topics covered in many of the following chapters were first presented in  		separate draft reports, which subsequently were consolidated into this report.  		</p>
<p>	<a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a> provides a more detailed description of  		the study's quantitative and qualitative methods. The procedures for selecting  		study states, study agencies, and study patients are described. In addition,  		the methods used to conduct the administrator, state home care association,  		focus group, and case study interviews are outlined. The processes employed in  		the management and analysis of the study data are also described.</p>
<p>	<a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a> provides descriptive information  		regarding the states, agencies, and patients involved in the study.  		Demographic, economic, health system, and beneficiary health status indicators  		are presented for each study state. The AQ data are used to provide a  		description of the agencies that contributed data to the final sample. Finally,  		the start of care case mix of the patients enrolled in the study is presented  		using OASIS and CPQ data. Descriptive information is presented across all  		patient episodes and also separately for episodes involving patients with the  		two tracer conditions, CHF and diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p><a href="#chapIV"> Chapter 4</a> presents the bulk of the quantitative  		analyses conducted as part of the study. In this chapter, the care provided  		during the study episodes is described and the impact of patient, provider,  		agency and market/regulatory factors on home care practices is summarized. The  		affect of practice patterns on the length of the episodes of care also is  		discussed. Finally, in this chapter, the relationship between practice patterns  		and patient functional outcomes is assessed.</p>
<p> The findings from the focus group and case study interviews are  		presented in <a href="#chapV">Chapter 5</a>. The analysis of the focus group  		data concentrates on factors that influence the decision to recertify or  		discharge home care patients. This chapter also provides a description of the  		case study episodes of care, including information about the services provided  		by the various disciplines. The content of the skilled nursing visits conducted  		with these patients is described, as is the process by which agency personnel  		plan, coordinate, and document their patients' care.</p>
<p><a href="#chapVI"> Chapter 6</a> presents information about provider  		perspectives on IPS and other changes in home health care. Findings are based  		on four different qualitative methods used to gather information about provider  		perspectives: (1) state home care association interviews, (2) administrator  		interviews, (3) focus group interviews, and (4) case study interviews. </p>
<p>	<a href="#chapVII">Chapter 7</a> provides a summary of the information  		and findings contained in this final report.

<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. METHODS</a></h2>
<p> This chapter summarizes the methods used to answer the three key study  		questions identified in <a href="#chapI">Chapter 1</a> and to examine the  		impact of policy changes on the field of home health care. <a href="#chapIIA">Section A</a> of this chapter presents the methods used for  		selecting the states, home care agencies, and patients involved in the study.  		The data collection procedures designed to (1) address the key study questions  		and (2) assess the impact of IPS are described in <a href="#chapIIB">Section  		B</a>. <a href="#chapIIC">Section C</a> provides information about the  		procedures employed in managing and analyzing the quantitative study data.</p>
<h3><a name="chapIIA" id="chapIIA">A. State, Agency, and Patient  		Selection</a></h3>
<h4>1. Selection of State Sample</h4>
<p> States were categorized by volume based on their average number of  		visits per Medicare beneficiary receiving home care in 1995. State volume group  		was identified through Online Survey Certification and Reporting System (OSCAR)  		data maintained by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).  		Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the highest and lowest quartiles (12 states each)  		were identified. To obtain a cross-section of states in each volume category,  		four states were selected in each of the two quartiles. The selection process  		was a collaborative effort between the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and the Center for Health Policy Research (the  		Research Center), with the final selection made by ASPE. The four low-volume  		states selected were Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Pennsylvania and the  		four high-volume states were Georgia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Texas.  		</p>
<p> The objective in the state-selection process was to select states in  		each volume category that reflected the entire category reasonably well in  		terms of state-level variables such as Medicaid home and community-based care  		expenditures, percentage of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care  		plans, and home health agency ownership and type distribution.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> Four states were selected per  		volume category so that variation in state characteristics could be obtained  		while at the same time including data from several agencies within each state.  		To avoid having any given state dominate a volume category, the goal was to  		obtain approximately equal numbers of agencies and patients from each state.  		</p>
<h4>2. Selection of Home Care Agencies</h4>
<p> The original design for agency selection called for a random sample of  		Medicare-certified home care agencies; seven agencies were to be randomly  		selected from each of the eight study states. The random-sampling approach was  		constrained for practical reasons by the implementation of three eligibility  		criteria: (1) agencies were required to have at least 150 annual admissions,  		(2) agencies could not be participating in other Research Center studies, and  		(3) agencies must have been in operation for at least one year prior to  		becoming involved in the study. Once agencies were randomly selected, agency  		administrators received recruitment materials by mail and were contacted by  		telephone and encouraged to participate in the study.</p>
<p> Sampling and recruitment of study agencies was complicated by the  		implementation of IPS. Agency administrators' concerns regarding the potential  		impact of IPS along with IPS-inspired changes in agency policies and staffing  		(e.g., more stringent productivity standards, downsizing of administrative  		staff) hindered the process of agency recruitment. Administrators of some  		randomly selected agencies were not willing to enroll their agencies in the  		study as a result of increasingly tight staffing and a general sense of concern  		about the future of their agencies. In order to recruit the target number of  		agencies, two of the eligibility criteria were relaxed. Agencies were required  		to have at least 100 annual admissions instead of 150, and agencies now were  		allowed to be involved in other Research Center studies.</p>
<p> During recruitment, agencies were offered a number of incentives to  		participate in the study. All agencies were offered one complimentary set of  		case mix and outcome reports to be produced after a minimum of one year of  		OASIS data on all agency patients had been submitted. Such reports were  		produced for 17 study agencies. In addition, agencies were offered the use of  		OASIS Genie software free of charge during the data collection phase of the  		study. Agencies that did use OASIS Genie received free technical assistance  		throughout their involvement in the study. Finally, all agencies were offered  		financial compensation for completion of important study milestones (e.g., the  		completion of data collection on thirty patients, participation in a focus  		group). The maximum possible payment for participating agencies was $1,500.</p>
<p> As a result of challenges to agency recruitment, random selection of  		agencies was not possible. Instead, agency administrators in the eight study  		states were contacted and invited to participate in the study with the goal of  		obtaining a sample of agencies that was representative of the home health  		market in the high- and low-volume states, which would provide approximately  		equal numbers of agencies and patients from each of the eight states, and  		include proprietary and non-proprietary, as well as hospital-based and  		freestanding agencies in each state sample.</p>
<p> As agency recruitment proceeded, it became apparent that a  		disproportionate number of participating agencies were hospital-based.  		Therefore, in order to ensure the recruitment of a sufficient number of  		freestanding agencies in the study, subsequent recruiting efforts emphasized  		freestanding agencies. (In addition, administrators of freestanding agencies  		were asked to enroll ten additional study patients each if possible.) The  		distribution of agencies within state volume categories was monitored for the  		hospital-based/freestanding and proprietary/non-proprietary splits.</p>
<p> These revised recruitment procedures resulted in the successful  		recruitment of the targeted 56 agencies for the study. Twenty-nine agencies  		were located in the four low-volume states and twenty-seven agencies were  		located in the four high-volume states. Detailed descriptive information about  		the study agencies is presented in <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p>	<strong><i>Agency Training</i></strong>: Clinical staff at each of the  		56 recruited agencies received training regarding data collection instruments  		and protocols. Training took place on site at each agency and was conducted by  		a nurse researcher from the Research Center. Each agency clinician who attended  		training received a reference manual containing detailed information about  		study goals and procedures. One staff member at each agency was designated as  		the Data Collection Coordinator (DCC).<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> The DCC, who participated in a one-on-one  		training session with a Research Center nurse researcher on site at his or her  		agency, was responsible for identifying patients that were eligible for  		participation in the study, tracking study patients and ensuring that data were  		collected according to the study protocol, informing clinical staff of the need  		to obtain informed consent and collect study data on eligible patients, and  		acting as the liaison between the agency and the Research Center. </p>
<p> Agencies were allowed to submit patient data in hardcopy form or  		electronically. For those agencies that submitted data electronically, a Data  		Entry Clerk (DEC) was identified at each site and was responsible for entry and  		electronic transmission of study data. For agencies using OASIS Genie software  		to enter and transmit data, the DEC participated in a telephone training  		session with technical assistance personnel from the Research Center. DECs from  		agencies using other data entry software were trained in the transmission of  		study data only. Technical assistance was provided as needed for the duration  		of the data collection phase of the study.</p>
<p> Because of high staff turnover at many study agencies during the data  		collection phase of the study, it was important for agencies to train clinical  		staff who had not been present for the original on-site training. In order to  		meet agency needs for periodic retraining, a professionally produced training  		video was developed and provided to each agency. This video contained complete  		training sessions for clinicians and DCCs. New DECs were trained over the  		telephone as needed.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Agency Attrition</strong></i>: During the course of data  		collection, several agencies discontinued their participation in the study.  		Twelve agencies formally withdrew from the study and an additional six agencies  		failed to submit useable longitudinal patient data. Of the agencies that  		formally withdrew, half submitted at least some useable data prior to  		withdrawing from the study. Therefore, of the 56 agencies recruited for  		participation in the study, 44 contributed data to the final sample used for  		analysis purposes.</p>
<p> Administrators of agencies that withdrew from the study cited a number  		of reasons for discontinuing their participation, many of which may have been  		related to the challenge of coping with new federal regulations and a new  		Medicare payment system for home health care. (The study data were collected  		entirely under IPS.) <a href="#table2.1">Table 2.1</a> identifies the main  		reasons agency administrators identified for discontinuing their participation  		in the study. Administrators cited multiple barriers to continued  		participation. Five agencies experienced changes in ownership and three  		agencies closed or underwent bankruptcy proceedings during the data collection  		phase of the study. Seven agencies had a change in location or coverage area  		and six experienced reductions in staff and/or the number of branch offices.  		Staff turnover and/or shortages influenced administrators' decisions to  		withdraw from the study at ten agencies. A shortage of staff often resulted in  		an agency's DCC assuming additional clinical, administrative, or clerical  		responsibilities, often interfering with his or her ability to coordinate  		study-related activities at the agency. In addition, staff turnover resulted in  		a shortage of study-trained clinicians and the need to retrain staff at five  		agencies. Other changes, such as changes in referral patterns and patient  		census, contributed to the withdrawal of six agencies. The transition to a new  		software system made study participation challenging for eight agencies.  		Finally, three agencies withdrew from the study in part because of the burden  		of OASIS data collection and of preparing for the then-upcoming implementation  		of PPS.</p>
<p> Agency attrition was greater for some categories of agencies than  		others. Of the 12 agencies that withdrew from the study, the majority was  		located in the high-volume states. Fifty-eight percent of the agencies that  		discontinued their participation in the study were located in states with high  		visit volume per beneficiary. Three quarters of agencies that withdrew from the  		study were proprietary and 83% were freestanding. These patterns held true for  		the six agencies that never formally withdrew from the study, but failed to  		submit useable study data. </p>
<p> This pattern of agency attrition suggests that agencies in the  		high-volume states, as well as proprietary and freestanding agencies, had  		greater difficulty adjusting to the changes brought about by the BBA. As  		discussed in <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>, agencies in high-volume states  		showed a more dramatic decline in visit volume per beneficiary after the  		implementation of IPS than did agencies in low-volume states. These agencies,  		as well as proprietary and freestanding agencies, which may have been less  		parsimonious in their provision of services prior to the implementation of IPS,  		may have had to reduce service utilization more substantially than other  		agencies to adjust to the changing home care environment. Indeed, according to  		the GAO (1999), agency closures between October 1997 and January 1999 were more  		common among agencies in high-utilization states, and among proprietary and  		freestanding agencies.</p>

</tr></table><h4>3. Selection of Study Patients</h4>
<p> Because one of the main goals of the study was to identify practice  		patterns associated with long lengths of stay in the Medicare home health  		benefit, it was important to collect data on a patient population for which  		long home health episodes are not uncommon. For this reason, the sample was  		limited to patients having primary or secondary diagnoses of congestive heart  		failure (CHF) or diabetes mellitus.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> In order to be considered eligible for the  		study, a patient also had to be age 65 years or older, covered by Medicare, and  		live in the state where the home care agency was located. Using these criteria,  		a total of 1,217 patients were enrolled in the study.</p>
<p> In the final patient sample, only patients with complete assessment  		data at the episode level were included. That is, in order to be included in  		the final sample, a patient was required to have complete OASIS and CPQ data  		both for the beginning and the ending of the episode of care. Patients were  		eliminated from the final patient sample for a variety of other reasons as  		well. Thirteen patients who were nonresponsive at start of care, died during  		the course of their episodes of care, or had large amounts of missing data were  		not included in the final sample because several important measures, including  		outcome measures could not be calculated for these individuals. In addition, 14  		patients were found to be ineligible for the study (e.g., had only one home  		health visit, were under that age of 65, did not have either requisite  		diagnosis). </p>
<p> The final patient sample for the study included 684 patients.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> Of these patients, 292 were  		diagnosed with CHF, 246 with diabetes mellitus, and 146 with both conditions.  		Across the 684 patients, complete assessment data were available for 732  		episodes of care.</p>
<h3><a name="chapIIB" id="chapIIB">B. Data Collection Procedures</a></h3>
<p> Data were collected using a variety of methods and instruments. Both  		quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Primary quantitative data  		were collected to examine patient, provider, and agency factors related to  		practice patterns and outcomes in home health care. Secondary data were used to  		measure important market/regulatory characteristics. Qualitative data were  		collected to explore practice and decision making in home health care and to  		assess provider perspectives regarding the impact of regulatory changes on the  		field of home health care. This section provides detailed information about the  		procedures employed in collecting the study data.</p>
<h4>1. Quantitative Methods</h4>
<p> This section identifies the data sources and describes the data  		collection procedures employed to collect quantitative data regarding patient  		factors, provider factors, agency factors, market/regulatory factors, practice  		patterns, and patient outcomes. The quantitative data analysis techniques  		employed as part of the study are described in <a href="#chapIIC">Section C</a>  		of this chapter.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Patient Factors</strong></i>: Beginning in February 1999 and  		ending in August 2000,<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> study patients were followed longitudinally,  		from start of care up to 260 days or study discharge, whichever occurred  		first.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> Study  		discharge occurred when a patient was discharged from his or her home care  		agency and did not resume services within 14 days.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Information on patient condition and care practices was collected every  		60 days using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-B1) and the  		newly created Care Provider Questionnaire (CPQ). OASIS data items focus on  		sociodemographic attributes, home environment, family support, health status,  		and functional status. Three versions of the OASIS instrument were used, one  		for start of care, one for follow-up, and one for discharge visits. The CPQ  		contained questions related to patient homebound status, Medicare authorization  		of services, assistance provided by the family/support system, and services  		provided by the agency. Two versions of the CPQ were created, one to be used  		for start of care, resumption of care, or readmission visits and one for  		recertification or discharge visits. At the episode level, 684 patients had  		complete assessment data. Episode-level data were considered complete if a  		patient had both a CPQ and an OASIS assessment for both the beginning (i.e.,  		start of care, resumption of care, readmission) and ending (i.e., discharge,  		transfer) of the home care episode. Across these 684 patients, there were 732  		complete episodes. Copies of the OASIS and CPQ are provided in  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Provider Factors</strong></i>: One of the goals of the study  		was to identify attributes of care providers that are related to variations in  		practice patterns. Information about the providers caring for study patients  		was collected primarily using the Care Provider Profile (CPP). This newly  		developed instrument contained questions regarding the educational background,  		experience, and expertise of the care providers involved in the study. The CPP  		was to be completed by all care providers expected to collect study data.  		Completed CPPs were available for 678 of the 732 study episodes. A copy of the  		CPP is included in <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>. Additional information  		about the home care providers and physicians caring for study patients was  		obtained from the CPQ.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Agency Factors</strong></i>: At the time each agency was  		recruited to participate in the study, the agency's administrator was asked to  		complete the Administrator Questionnaire (AQ). This instrument was designed to  		elicit information related to agency factors that may affect the practice of  		home health care (e.g., licensing and accreditation, reimbursement, caseload,  		changes due to venipuncture regulations, use of nurse productivity standards,  		case management and supervision). (Administrators' responses to the AQ items  		were not independently verified.) Completed AQs were received from 42 of the 44  		study agencies included in the final sample and were completed between November  		1998-October 1999. <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a> contains a copy of the AQ.  		Additional information about the study agencies was obtained through the  		CPQ.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Market/Regulatory Factors</strong></i>: Information about  		market/regulatory factors that may affect practice patterns in home health care  		was obtained primarily from secondary sources. Although the AQ provided some  		market/regulatory information, other data relevant to market/regulatory factors  		were obtained through publicly available data sets, such as OSCAR, the Area  		Resource File (ARF), and through publications of the American Association of  		Retired Persons (AARP).</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Practice Patterns</strong></i>: Many of the practice pattern  		measures used as part of the study were calculated based on billing data.  		Participating agencies submitted billing records (e.g., UB-92 data) for each of  		their study patients. From these records, practice pattern measures such as  		visits by discipline and total visits were calculated. In the calculation of  		practice pattern measures, such as the number of visits per discipline, all  		non-Medicare and non-billable visits were excluded. Some additional practice  		pattern variables, such as those variables reflecting the use of alternative  		resources and oversight of clinicians' decisions regarding patient care were  		calculated from CPQ data items.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Patient Outcome</strong></i>: Patient functional outcome was  		assessed using OASIS data. An aggregate measure of functional outcome was  		calculated, representing the percentage of the 27 standard improvement scores  		reported by CMS in nationally available outcome-based quality improvement  		(OBQI) reports on which a patient improved. The denominator for this  		calculation was the number of improvement scores for which a patient had valid  		data. Each improvement score was calculated only if a patient had the  		possibility of improving. If a patient was at the most independent level at  		start of care for a given measure, an improvement score could not be  		calculated.</p>
<h4>2. Qualitative Methods</h4>
<p> The study involved a number of qualitative data collection methods  		designed to address the study questions and/or the impact of IPS. The impact of  		IPS as perceived by the home care industry was examined through interviews with  		the administrators of the study agencies and through interviews with  		representatives of the home care associations in each of the eight study  		states. Focus groups composed of several nurses each were conducted on site at  		eight of the study agencies to gather information regarding decision making in  		home health care. Case study interviews designed to examine practice and  		decision making in home health care were conducted with one nurse from each of  		seven agencies. The focus groups and case studies also provided insight into  		provider perspectives on IPS and changes in the field of home health care. The  		procedures, samples, and analytic techniques used as part of these qualitative  		methods are presented in the following sections and are summarized in  		<a href="#table2.2">Table 2.2</a>.</p>

Because the data from the administrator interviews were analyzed  		and reported in an interim deliverable before the composition of the final  		agency sample was known, the summary of the results from these interviews that  		is presented in <a href="#chapVI"> Chapter 6</a> includes all 54 agencies for  		which interviews were completed. The interviews, which took place between  		February and September 1999, were conducted by Research Center staff either  		over the telephone (19 interviews) or on site at each of the agencies (35  		agencies). A standardized interview protocol was used that consisted of four  		questions and standard probes within each question (shown in  		<a href="#table2.3">Table 2.3</a>). A copy of the protocol was made available  		to each administrator prior to the interview. The interviews lasted  		approximately 20 minutes and the responses were recorded by the interviewer  		directly into a laptop or desktop computer. </p>

These themes were  		recorded with the agency identification number and, if a theme appeared more  		than once, the additional agency numbers were recorded for that theme.  		Appropriate quotes also were recorded. The next step of the thematic analysis  		involved analyzing the discrete themes for broader patterns within each  		question and across volume and ownership categories. A research assistant  		conducted the data reduction coding. Ten percent of the interviews also were  		coded by a research associate to ensure reliability and quality assurance in  		the coding procedure. The remaining portion of the thematic analysis was  		conducted by a research associate and was reviewed by a nurse researcher for  		quality assurance.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>State Home Care Association Interviews</strong></i>: To  		identify how IPS impacted the field of home health care in the eight study  		states, telephone interviews were conducted with representatives of the state  		home care associations in each state. These interviews were conducted between  		July and November 1999. Like the administrator interviews, the more  		unstructured state home care association interviews focused on how IPS had  		impacted the administrative and care practices of agencies in the study states.  		The following themes were explored during the course of the interviews:  		staffing changes, cost shifting, agency closures and mergers, changes in case  		mix and services offered, and reduction in access to home care.  		<a href="#table2.5">Table 2.5</a> contains the three questions included in the  		state home care association interviews. Qualitative analyses of the data  		collected during the state home care association interviews was conducted by a  		research associate following the same steps of thematic analysis used in the  		analysis of the administrator interviews.</p>

</tr></table><p>	<i><strong>Focus Groups and Case Studies</strong></i>: Focus group and  		case study interviews were designed to examine practice and decision making in  		home health care. As a condition of involvement in this study, agencies agreed  		to participate in the focus groups and case studies. Eight agencies (one agency  		from each of the eight states involved in the study) were selected to  		participate in the focus group and case study interviews.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> These eight agencies were  		selected to maximize the diversity of the focus group and case study samples.  		Therefore, four of the agencies were from states with high visit volume, and  		four agencies were from states with low visit volume. Within each state volume  		group, equal numbers of agencies from each of the agency ownership and agency  		type categories were selected for participation. <a href="#table2.6">Table  		2.6</a> presents the 2X2 design for agency selection. The same agencies were  		selected for participation in both the focus groups and the case studies.</p>

</tr></table><p> The focus group interviews were conducted on site at each of the eight  		selected agencies between July and October 1999. Each focus group involved  		several nurses. Prior to participating in a focus group, nurses signed a  		consent form and completed the Participant Demographic Form (<a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a> contains the Focus Group Protocol and  		Participant Demographic Form). As <a href="#table2.7">Table 2.7</a> indicates,  		the number of participants involved in the focus group interviews ranged from  		four to seven, with an average of five participants per group. The majority of  		participants was female (93.0%), White (81.4%), and between 32 and 54 years of  		age (74.4%). With the exception of a single participant who failed to indicate  		her educational background, all of the participants were RNs. Although 54.8% of  		the focus group participants had been in home care for more than five years,  		72.1% had been with their agencies for five years or less.</p>
<p> A nurse researcher from the Research Center facilitated the focus  		groups. The main purpose of the focus groups was to facilitate discussions  		among home health care providers regarding the decision to recertify or to  		discharge a patient. During the focus group interviews, two vignettes  		illustrating common clinical situations were presented. The vignettes, which  		describe patients for which the appropriateness of recertification or discharge  		is somewhat unclear, provided context for discussing the interpretation of  		coverage rules and the process of justifying a need for home health services.  		</p>
<p> The focus group discussion was audiotaped and also recorded by a note  		taker from the Research Center. The notes from the focus groups (augmented by  		the audiotape information) were transcribed and imported into a qualitative  		analysis software package, NUD*IST (Non-numeric Unstructured Data, Index  		Searching and Theorizing). NUD*IST was used by the analysis team (consisting of  		both clinical and analysis staff) to code the focus group data (i.e., text)  		into analytic themes. The first step of the thematic analysis involved  		categorizing the data into themes related to the research and policy questions  		that the focus group interviews were designed to address. Data related to each  		theme were examined for patterns associated with state volume, agency  		ownership, agency type, and patient vignette. Although the sample was too small  		to identify differences between agencies in the different state volume, agency  		ownership, and agency type categories, participants' responses often were  		specific to one vignette or the other. Vignette-specific information is  		reported when appropriate.</p>

</tr></table><p> The eight agencies that participated in the focus groups also were  		selected for participation in the case study interviews. These interviews were  		conducted between October and November 1999. Personnel at each of the eight  		agencies were asked to identify each patient fitting the following  		criteria:</p>
<ul><li>65 years of age or older;</li>
<li>Medicare as the primary payer;</li>
<li>Primary diagnosis of CHF;<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></li>
<li>Discharged after January 1, 1999; and</li>
<li>Not discharged due to death or admission to an inpatient  		  facility.</li>
</ul><p> For each patient fitting the five criteria, agency personnel provided  		information about the patient's start of care and discharge dates, the number  		of visits the patient received from the various disciplines (e.g., aides,  		physical therapy), date of birth, level of family involvement, diagnoses, level  		of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental  		activities of daily living (IADLs), and services provided outside of the  		agency. Research Center staff used this information to identify a single  		patient at each agency on which the case study interview would focus. When more  		than one patient met all of the eligibility criteria, patients were chosen  		based on their episode lengths. Because it might have been difficult to obtain  		long-stay patients in states with a low number of visits per patient on  		average, we attempted to select short-stay patients in low-volume states and  		long-stay patients in high-volume states. We were able to identify patients  		with episodes of 120 days or longer (the definition of long stay used for the  		case study) in only two states (both high-volume states). The remaining case  		study patients were on service less than 60 days.</p>
<p> After the patient-selection process was complete, informed consent was  		received from both the selected patients and their primary nurses. A research  		associate at the Research Center then conducted case study interviews with the  		primary nurses (<a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a> contains the protocol for the  		case study interviews). In one case, the patient's primary nurse was no longer  		working at the agency. The nursing supervisor, who had been in daily contact  		with the primary nurse about this patient, took part in the case study  		interview. It was clear that the supervisor was well acquainted with the  		patient and the details of the episode of care.</p>
<p> At one of the eight agencies, agency personnel were able to identify  		only a single patient who met the patient-eligibility criteria. This patient  		had been discharged from home care and subsequently died prior to the time that  		the case study interviews were conducted. Agency personnel were unwilling to  		contact the patient's family to obtain consent for the patient's nurse to  		participate in a case study interview. Therefore, Research Center staff was  		unable to conduct a case study interview with this agency.</p>
<p> The case study interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Similar to  		the analysis of the focus group data, themes relevant to the key research  		questions were identified in the case study data. Due to the small number of  		participants involved, the classification of the case study data into thematic  		categories was conducted manually (rather than using software such as  		NUD*IST).</p>
<h3><a name="chapIIC" id="chapIIC">C. Data Management and Analysis  		Procedures</a></h3>
<p> This section of the report summarizes procedures used in managing and  		assuring the quality of the study data as well as the statistical techniques  		employed in analyzing the quantitative data.</p>
<h4>1. Data Management Procedures</h4>
<p> Study-related data were received at the Research Center either in  		hardcopy or in electronic format. Agencies were permitted to submit OASIS and  		CPQ data in either format, whereas all other data (e.g., AQ, CPP, billing  		records) were submitted in hardcopy. Data that were submitted in hardcopy were  		data entered by Research Center staff. Ten percent of CPQ and OASIS data were  		entered two times each to identify typos and/or systematic errors in data  		entry. The accuracy rate for CPQ and OASIS data entry was 99.5%.</p>
<p> Several measures were taken to ensure the quality of the study data.  		All hardcopy data underwent "up-front review," whereby a research assistant  		reviewed the data for any obvious data quality problems prior to the data being  		entered (e.g., missing responses). If problems were identified, the research  		assistant contacted the agency's DCC for clarification. Further, during the  		data collection phase of the study, a clinician from the Research Center  		contacted DCCs regularly (usually biweekly) to clarify data collection  		procedures and to follow-up on data collection and quality issues. All data  		were subjected to a variety of quality checks, such as checks to identify out  		of range or extreme values, to ensure that skip patterns were followed  		appropriately, and to identify and remove patient assessment data collected  		more than 14 days after the visit date. In addition, data that violated the  		data collection protocol or patient eligibility requirements were eliminated  		from the study database.</p>
<p> All OASIS and CPQ data were processed through an extensive series of  		electronic data quality checks. These checks were designed to identify  		inappropriately missing data or cross-item inconsistency in responses (e.g.,  		reporting that there is no family support system on one data item and that the  		family support system provides assistance with activities of daily living  		[ADLs] on another item). When missing data or inconsistencies were apparent in  		an agency's data, a Data Quality Report (DQR) outlining the problems was sent  		to the DCC along with a request for clarification. After the data collection  		phase of the study ended, all questionnaire responses for which clarification  		had not been received were set to missing.</p>
<p> After all data quality activities were completed, longitudinal data  		files were generated. As a first step, OASIS and CPQ assessments were matched  		to each other to establish complete assessment data for a given assessment time  		point for a patient. Then, episodes of care were established separately for  		OASIS and CPQ data. That is, each OASIS start of care and resumption of care  		assessment was matched to the next chronological discharge or transfer  		assessment. Likewise, each start of care, resumption of care, and readmission  		CPQ was matched to the next chronological discharge CPQ assessment.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> These separate OASIS and CPQ  		episodes were then matched to each other. Episodes with complete matching OASIS  		and CPQ data were retained for final analysis.</p>
<h4>2. Data Analysis Procedures</h4>
<p> This section of the report contains summary information regarding the  		analytic techniques used as part of the study. Information is provided  		regarding techniques for conducting descriptive analyses, two-group  		comparisons, and multivariate analyses of practice patterns and patient  		outcomes.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Descriptive Analyses</strong></i>: In <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a> and <a href="#chapIV"> Chapter 4</a> of the  		report, basic descriptive statistics are presented to provide an overview of  		the study care providers, agencies, and patterns of home care practice. The  		descriptive statistics presented differ for continuous and categorical  		variables. For continuous variables, the mean, median, minimum, and maximum  		values are presented. For categorical variables, the percentage of agencies,  		care providers, or patients for which each response was selected is identified.  		The N is reported for all variables. Also in <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>,  		secondary data are presented describing the market/regulatory characteristics  		of the eight study states. </p>
<p>	<a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a> includes a summary of the sample of  		patients enrolled in the study. Descriptive statistics and two-group  		comparisons are presented to provide a picture of the patients at the start of  		each episode of care. (These analyses were conducted at the episode, rather  		than the patient level.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup>) For each variable, the mean value or the  		percentage of episodes having each response is presented. In addition, the  		degree to which the responses differ by tracer condition (i.e., CHF or diabetes  		mellitus) is reported. For categorical variables for which the minimum expected  		cell frequency was less than or equal to 20, two-tailed Fisher's exact tests  		were conducted to determine the significance of the differences between the  		responses of patients with CHF and diabetes mellitus. When the minimum expected  		cell frequency was larger than 20, the significance value reported was the  		p-value associated with the continuity-adjusted Chi-Square. </p>
<p> For items with continuous response options, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test  		of normality and the N for each sample were used to determine which two-group  		test should be employed. When both samples sizes were larger than 120, the  		t-test was used, regardless of the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When  		either sample size was less than 30, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was used  		regardless of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov results. When either sample size was  		between 30 and 120, the test used depended on the results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov  		test. If the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was not significant at the .10 level  		(indicating normality), the t-test was used, whereas if the Kolmogorov-Smirnov  		test was significant at the .10 level (indicating nonnormality), the Wilcoxon  		Rank-Sum test was used. </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Multivariate Analyses</strong></i>: The bulk of the  		quantitative analyses for the study are presented in <a href="#chapIV"> Chapter  		4</a>. In addition to the descriptive statistics based on practice pattern  		variables mentioned previously, <a href="#chapIV"> Chapter 4</a> includes three  		sets of multivariate analyses respectively designed to assess the impact of (1)  		patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors on practice patterns  		(e.g., length of stay), (2) practice patterns on episode length, and (3)  		practice patterns on patient outcomes. In the latter two sets of analyses,  		important patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors were  		controlled.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The multivariate analyses were conducted using ordinary least squares  		(OLS) regression. For each of the three sets of analyses identified above, the  		analysis procedure involved two steps. Step 1 focused on the identification of  		important independent variables to be retained in the final regression model  		for a particular dependent variable (i.e., Step 2). In the first set of  		analyses listed above, four regression models were conducted for each practice  		pattern dependent variable, identifying important patient, provider, agency,  		and market/regulatory factors, respectively. Independent variables showing a  		significant or marginal relationship with the dependent variable (p&lt;.10)  		were identified for inclusion in the final model. Certain patient, provider,  		agency, and market/regulatory variables were designated as "required  		variables." These variables, such as patient age, agency ownership, and state  		volume group, were considered important enough theoretically to be retained in  		the final regression model, regardless of the significance value associated  		with their relationships with the dependent variable. Step 2 involved a single  		model in which all significant and marginal independent variables, as well as  		all required variables, were combined into a single regression model predicting  		the dependent variable.</p>
<p> The second set of analyses described above was conducted using a  		similar process. In this case, however, the Step 1 models were used to identify  		important patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory variables to be  		included as covariates when examining the relationship between practice  		patterns and episode length. Again, all independent variables from the four  		Step 1 models that were significant or marginal, or were considered too  		important theoretically to eliminate, were included in the final Step 2 model  		along with the practice pattern independent variables, to predict length of  		stay for home care practices.</p>
<p> The third set of analyses described above was conducted in similar  		fashion. Four Set 1 models were conducted to identify important patient,  		provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors needing to be controlled in the  		final regression model. The significant/marginal and required variables were  		included in the final Step 2, along with the practice pattern independent  		variables, to predict patient functional outcome from care practices.</p>
<h4>3. Identification of Important Variables</h4>
<p> A large amount of data was collected during the course of the study.  		Consequently, there were far more variables available than reasonably could be  		analyzed. Prior to conducting multivariate analyses, the variables that would  		be included in the Step 1 regression models were designated. After identifying  		the variables of greatest theoretical value, preliminary descriptive and  		correlation analyses were conducted to assist in the identification of the most  		important variables. Some potential independent variables were eliminated from  		the multivariate analyses as a result of large amounts of missing data and/or a  		lack of sufficient variability. Others were removed because of strong  		correlations with other important independent variables. As mentioned above, of  		those variables retained for use as independent variables in the Step 1  		regression models, some were identified as being of particular importance  		(i.e., the required variables).<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup><a href="#appendF">Appendix F</a> contains a  		list of the variables selected for inclusion as independent variables in the  		multivariate analyses. The variables designated as required variables are  		identified.</p>
<h4>4. Missing Data</h4>
<p> Because of the small size of the final episode-level sample, it was  		important to retain as many records as possible when conducting the  		multivariate analyses. Therefore, missing values for each independent variable  		identified for inclusion in the regression models were substituted with the  		variable's cross-sample mean. Of the thirty-six variables for which some  		records had missing values, none of those variables had more than 10% missing  		data. All but eight variables had less than 5% missing data. </p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY STATES, AGENCIES, CARE  		PROVIDERS, AND PATIENTS</a></h2>
<p> This chapter provides descriptive information regarding the states,  		agencies, and patients participating in the study. <a href="#chapIIIA">Section  		A</a> provides a detailed description of the eight study states. For each  		state, information is provided about economic measures, demographic  		characteristics, and health care resources and expenditures.  		<a href="#chapIIIB">Section B</a> presents descriptive information regarding  		the agency sample based on Administrator Questionnaire (AQ) data. In  		<a href="#chapIIIC">Section C</a>, information about the study patients'  		physicians and home care staff is summarized. Data from the Care Provider  		Profile (CPP) and the Care Provider Questionnaire (CPQ) are used to describe  		the background, expertise, and level of involvement of the care providers.  		<a href="#chapIIID">Section D</a> summarizes the start of care case mix of the  		study patients. Descriptive analyses using OASIS and CPQ data are presented  		across the sample and by tracer condition (i.e., CHF and diabetes mellitus) and  		differences in case mix between the patients in the two tracer groups are  		described.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="chapIIIA" id="chapIIIA">A. Description of Study  		States</a></h3>
<p> As indicated previously, states were categorized into high- and  		low-volume groups based on their average number of Medicare home health visits  		per beneficiary per year. Data from 1995 were used to categorize states into  		volume groups. To ensure that the volume categorizations were appropriate for  		later years during which the study data were collected, visit volume by state  		was compared for 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. Examining the data for these years  		was especially important given the major changes brought about by IPS. </p>
<p>	<a href="#table3.1">Table 3.1</a> presents information regarding visits  		per patient for each study state and volume category for the four years. These  		data show the dramatic reduction in visits per patient in all states between  		1997 and 1998 (the first full year of IPS). The reduction in the average number  		of visits was greater for the high-volume than for the low-volume states  		(averaging 36 visits versus 11 visits, respectively). As one would expect,  		these findings suggest that agencies in states where visits were provided in a  		parsimonious fashion prior to IPS might have had fewer discretionary services  		that could be eliminated than did agencies in states where visits were provided  		in higher volume. However, in percentage terms, the reduction in the  		high-volume states was not much greater than in the low-volume states (32.0%  		versus 25.3%, respectively). Thus, even with the dramatic reductions in visit  		volume in 1998, fairly large and consistent differences in visits per patient  		between high- and low-volume states continued under IPS. Whereas high-volume  		states provided an average of 2.65 times the number of visits per patient in  		1997 than did low-volume states, they provided 2.44 times the average number of  		visits per patient in 1998.</p>

</tr></table><p> Demographic, economic, health system, and health status indicators also  		were compared between the state volume groups using available secondary data.  		Selected statistics are presented in Tables 3.2-3.6. It should be noted that  		the data presented in these tables pertain to periods prior to the  		implementation of IPS. (Additional summary information is presented by state in  		<a href="#appendD">Appendix D</a>.) In the tables, data are presented for each  		state, along with averages for the four states in each state volume group, and  		for the nation. The differences between the volume group averages often are not  		large, and in some cases, the differences among states within a volume group  		are greater than the differences between the groups. Nevertheless, taken  		together, the various differences suggest the general patterns described below.  		</p>
<p> Demographic and economic statistics are presented in  		<a href="#table3.2">Table 3.2</a>. Comparing the two state volume groups,  		low-volume relative to high-volume states have higher per capita incomes than  		high-volume states. However, there is considerable variation within each volume  		group, particularly the high-volume group in which per capita income ranges  		from a low of $18,300 in Mississippi to a high of $31,500 in Massachusetts (the  		lowest and second highest per capita incomes for all eight study states).  		Although the low-volume group has a higher average percentage of the population  		in the 65 and over age group, a lower percentage of that age group is in  		poverty (as measured by the percentage at or below 135% of the federally  		established poverty rate). In both state groups, approximately the same  		percentage of the elderly population lives alone, but the low-volume group has  		a lower rate of elderly with mobility or self-care difficulties. (The highest  		rate is in the high-volume state of Mississippi, where over one-quarter of the  		elderly population reported such difficulties in 1990.)</p>

Although the numbers of  		geriatricians are small, the difference in rates between the low- and  		high-volume groups indicates the availability of about one-third more  		geriatricians per elderly person in the low-volume state group. The pattern for  		physician visits per Medicare beneficiary is consistent with the differences in  		physician availability, with generally higher visit rates in the low-volume  		states. </p>

The two  		groups of states have contrasting expenditure patterns, with the low-volume  		group characterized by lower Medicare but higher Medicaid payments per  		beneficiary or enrollee than the high-volume group. Medicaid long-term care  		expenditures show considerable variation in total program size among the  		states, reflected by differences in the number of recipients, services  		provided, and payment rates. Both volume groups include relatively small  		(Oregon and Mississippi) as well as relatively large (Pennsylvania and Texas)  		Medicaid long-term care expenditure components. The allocation of long-term  		care expenditures by service category reveals differences among states within  		each volume group and between volume groups. On average, the low-volume group  		devotes a slightly lower percentage of Medicaid long-term care expenditures to  		nursing home care than does the high-volume group, but this is largely due to  		the very low percentage for Oregon. Both the lowest and highest percentages are  		in the low-volume group, with 34.1% for Oregon and 76.4% for Minnesota. All  		other states devote between one-half and three-quarters of their long-term care  		expenditures to nursing home care. </p>
<p> Comparing the averages of the low- and high-volume state groups, the  		low-volume group has slightly lower personal care and home health expenditure  		percentages but a higher home and community-based services waiver percentage.  		However, the group averages are highly influenced by individual state  		percentages. In particular, Oregon devotes nearly half (45.3%) of its Medicaid  		long-term care expenditures to waiver programs. At the opposite extreme,  		Mississippi (in the high-volume group) spends less than 1% of its long-term  		care expenditures on waiver programs. Thus, the distribution of long-term care  		Medicaid expenditures varies considerably among states and no clear pattern  		emerges that distinguishes between the two volume groups. </p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p> The study agencies reflected a variety of important agency-level  		factors. Importantly, the agencies provided a cross-section with regard to  		three factors that may play a critical role in the practice of home health  		care: state volume, agency ownership, and agency type. Slightly more than half  		of the agencies (59.1%) were located in states with low visit volume per  		patient. The remaining 40.9% of the agencies were located in high-volume  		states. Sixty-six percent of the agencies were non-proprietary or government  		agencies (see <a href="#table3.7">Table 3.7</a>). The remaining 34% were  		proprietary agencies. The agency sample had nearly equal representation of  		hospital-based and freestanding agencies (48% and 52%, respectively). As is  		typically the case, the hospital-based agencies are primarily non-proprietary.  		In the freestanding category, more agencies are proprietary than  		non-proprietary; the non-proprietary category includes Visiting Nurse  		Association (VNA), government, and private non-profit agencies. </p>
<h4>2. AQ Descriptive Statistics</h4>
<p> Table E.1 in <a href="#appendE">Appendix E</a> contains descriptive  		statistics for each AQ item (<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a> contains a copy  		of the AQ). For continuous variables, the mean, median, minimum and maximum  		values are presented. For categorical variables, the percentage of agencies for  		which each response was selected is identified. The number of agencies having  		data for each item also is reported. The final two items in the AQ (items 69  		and 70) were excluded from the table. These items, which elicit information  		about staff attendance at study training sessions and identifying information  		about each agency's Data Collection Coordinator, respectively, were designed  		for internal Research Center use only. Therefore, responses to these items have  		not been included in this report. For a number of questions on the AQ, agency  		administrators were allowed to provide open-ended responses. These responses  		are compiled by question in Table E.2 in <a href="#appendE">Appendix E</a>.  		Items with open-ended responses contained in the Appendix are identified in  		Table E.1.</p>
<p> The main objective of the following comments is to provide basic  		descriptive information about the study agencies using the AQ data.  		<a href="#appendE">Appendix E</a> provides descriptive statistics for each AQ  		item so that the reader can concentrate on specific areas of interest.  		Therefore, only a few summary narrative comments are included here. Most study  		agencies (95.2%) were located in states requiring licensure (AQ item 7). Among  		the study agencies, the majority was accredited (76.2%), most by JCAHO (73.8%).  		Only 2.4% of the study agencies were accredited by the Community Health  		Assessment Program (CHAP), the only other accrediting organization mentioned by  		study agency administrators (AQ item 8).</p>
<p> Medicare patients represented a large percentage of the caseload for  		most study agencies. On average, 74.1% of the agencies' patients were Medicare  		patients (AQ item 13). However, the range in Medicare caseload was considerable  		-- from as little as 10% to 100% of the caseload. Slightly less than half of  		the agencies were operating over the Medicare per-visit cost limits (42.9%) (AQ  		item 11). One-third was operating over their annual per-beneficiary limits as  		well (33.3%) (AQ item 12).</p>
<p> Most agencies had standards with regard to nurse productivity, but not  		with regard to the assignment of a home health aide. Of the responding  		agencies, 40.5% had unwritten nurse productivity standards and another 45.2%  		maintained written nurse productivity standards (AQ item 23). On average,  		nurses were required to make 5.6 patient visits per day (AQ item 24). The  		number of visits required was as low as four at some agencies and as high as  		eight at others. The majority (76.2%) of the agencies did not use standards for  		the assignment of home health aide services (AQ item 39).</p>
<p> In most agencies, primary care providers made important decisions about  		the care patients receive. The nurse who performed the initial assessment of a  		patient was almost always the person responsible for making the initial  		decision regarding the number of visits that patient would receive (93.8% of  		the time) (AQ item 35). Further, the provider who saw the patient at start of  		care was usually responsible for completing the HCFA-485 (78.6% of the time)  		(AQ item 48). Administrators from most agencies (81.0%) indicated that it was  		most frequently the primary care provider who made decisions regarding  		recertification (AQ item 51).</p>
<p> However, in most agencies, care providers received supervision in their  		decision making. At the majority of the agencies (85.7%), nurses met with their  		supervisors at least weekly (AQ item 46). At more than half of the agencies  		(60.9%), therapists met with their supervisors at least weekly, as well. At  		69.0% of the agencies, interdisciplinary case conferences (at which patients'  		cases were reviewed) occurred at least twice a month (AQ item 47). At nearly  		half of the agencies (47.6%), these case conferences occurred at least once a  		week. Administrators at 90.5% of the agencies reported that staff other than  		the primary care provider regularly verified patient eligibility for home  		health care services (AQ item 38).</p>
<p> Further, the care that home care workers provided often was guided by  		their agencies' critical pathways. More than 40% of agency administrators  		indicated that their agencies use standardized care plans or critical pathways  		(AQ item 25). These agencies had diagnosis-specific pathways for several  		important conditions. The majority of these agencies use pathways for chronic  		obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CHF, myocardial infarction (MI) and other  		cardiac conditions, pressure ulcers, other wounds, fractured hip, total hip  		replacement, total knee replacement, cerebral vascular accident (CVA), diabetes  		mellitus, and osteoarthritis (AQ item 27).</p>
<p> Administrators reported few changes in the delivery of services at  		their agencies as a result of the then newly implemented venipuncture  		regulations (AQ item 28). Most agencies had experienced no changes in their  		service areas (86.5%) or in the amount of time spent on care planning (76.9%).  		However, many agencies (65.4%) had decreased the number of visits they provided  		to their patients. </p>
<h3><a name="chapIIIC" id="chapIIIC">C. Description of Study Care  		Providers</a></h3>
<p> <a href="#table3.8">Table 3.8</a> provides descriptive information  		based on CPP and CPQ data about the home care providers and physicians caring  		for the study patients. Because the home care provider conducting the start of  		care visit plays a vital role in determining a patient's plan of care, most of  		the information provided in the table reflects the characteristics of the  		providers conducting the start of care visits for each of the 732 episodes of  		care.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> However, a few  		variables from the CPQ are presented based on discharge data (i.e., the  		physician's care plan role, level of input, overall physician awareness and  		involvement). Because these variables are based on home care provider  		perception, it seemed that care providers would be better able to assess the  		role of the physician at the end, rather than the beginning, of the  		episode.</p>
<p> Across the 732 episodes of care, the vast majority of the start of care  		visits was conducted by registered nurses (98.7%). Physical therapists and  		speech therapists conducted the remaining start of care visits (1.2% and 0.1%,  		respectively). The majority of the providers conducting these visits was  		full-time agency staff (71.8%), and nearly all were employees of their agencies  		(i.e., not contracted staff; 95.4%). Most had traveled less than half an hour  		to conduct the start of care visit (84.5%). </p>
<p> Of the 678 providers for whom data were available at the start of care,  		nearly half had an Associate's degree as their highest level of education  		(43.5%), 30.2% had a Bachelor's degree, and 19.8% had a high school diploma.  		Only 6.1% of the care providers had a Master's degree. Most of the providers  		indicated they had specific areas of health care expertise (e.g., special  		certification or strong experience). Most commonly, the providers noted having  		special expertise in treating patients with medical/surgical conditions  		(50.1%). A substantial percentage of the care providers reported having  		expertise or experience in the care of patients with the two medical conditions  		targeted for this project. Forty-three percent had experience treating  		cardiovascular problems and 32.7% had expertise in treating diabetes. Slightly  		over one-third of the care providers had expertise in IV therapy and wound  		management (33.6% and 35.4%, respectively). Other areas of expertise were less  		commonly reported.</p>
<p> The care providers conducting the start of care visits had quite a bit  		of experience in home health care. More than half of the providers (54.4%) had  		six or more years of experience in the home health industry. Only 13.4% of the  		providers were relatively new to home health care, having been in the business  		less than two years. Perhaps partly because of the experience of the care  		providers, the majority of visits were conducted without the use of a  		standardized care plan (62.4%). Indeed, there is a small, but significant  		correlation between these variables, suggesting that more experienced care  		providers were less likely to use standardized care plans (r=-0.135,  		p=0.0004).</p>

Prior to the  		beginning of the home care episodes, few physicians provided home care agency  		staff with specific recommendations regarding the type and frequency of home  		care services to be provided. In only 19.6% of the study episodes did the  		patients' physicians recommend a specific frequency with which nursing visits  		should occur. Only 16.1% of the physicians ordered home health aide services,  		and 23.1% requested an evaluation for the need for aide services. </p>
<p> During the episode, many physicians maintained a relatively low level  		of involvement. Only 27.1% of the home care providers completing the discharge  		CPQ for a given episode of care indicated that the physician overseeing the  		episode had a major role (i.e., was actively involved) in the development of  		the patient's care plan. In most cases (54.0%), the physician was perceived as  		being moderately involved. In these cases, the physician mainly responded to  		suggestions from the home care staff as to how a patient's care should be  		handled rather than actively making suggestions regarding the care plan. In  		18.9% of the cases, the physicians were perceived as having no involvement in  		care planning other than signing the HCFA-485 and other orders. In the vast  		majority of cases (85.6%), discharge came at the recommendation of the home  		care staff rather than the physicians.</p>
<p> Although the physicians did not always play a major role in the  		development of the care plan, the home care personnel appear to have been  		comfortable with the level of physician involvement throughout the episodes of  		care. Although only slightly over one-quarter of home care providers indicated  		that the physician was actively involved in the development of the patient's  		care plan, the majority of home care providers considered the level of  		physician input to be sufficient (87.1%) and nearly all (97.8%) felt that the  		physicians were aware of the care being provided.</p>
<h3><a name="chapIIID" id="chapIIID">D. Description of Study  		Patients</a></h3>
<p> The final patient sample included 684 patients. Of these patients, 292  		were diagnosed with CHF, 246 with diabetes mellitus, and 146 with both  		conditions.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> Only  		patients with complete assessment data for one or more episodes of care were  		retained in the final sample. Assessment data were considered complete if a  		patient had OASIS and CPQ data for both the beginning and the ending of an  		episode of care. </p>
<p> Across the 684 patients, complete assessment data were available for  		732 episodes of care. The vast majority of patients had only one episode of  		care in the final sample (94.7%). An additional 4.1% of patients had two  		episodes, and 1.1% had three or more.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> The number of episodes per patient is  		similar for those patients with CHF and those with diabetes mellitus. Among CHF  		patients, 93.8% had only a single episode, whereas 5.0% had two episodes, and  		1.1% had three or more. Likewise, 94.9% of diabetes mellitus patients had only  		a single episode of care, whereas 3.3% had two episodes, and 1.8% had three or  		more episodes.</p>
<p><a href="#table3.9"> Table 3.9</a> provides descriptive information  		about the start of care case mix of the patients treated during the 732 study  		episodes. This information is provided across episodes and also separately by  		tracer condition. The degree to which the patients in the two condition groups  		differ is reported. (The episodes for the 146 patients diagnosed with both  		conditions are included in both the CHF and the diabetes mellitus groups.)  		Given that a patient's condition can vary drastically from episode to episode,  		analyses were conducted at the episode level rather than the patient level.  		Therefore, for patients with multiple episodes of care, start of care  		information from each episode was included in the analyses.</p>
<p> Patients enrolled in the study were quite elderly. Although patients  		age 65 and older were eligible for participation, at the start of care, the  		average age of study subjects across conditions was 78.4 years of age. Patients  		diagnosed with CHF were significantly older than those diagnosed with diabetes  		mellitus (80.2 versus 76.4, respectively). Not surprising for such an elderly  		population, the majority of subjects in both the CHF and diabetes mellitus  		groups was female. In both condition groups, the majority of the study  		participants was White.</p>

</tr></table><p> Although all of the patients enrolled in the study were Medicare  		patients, few patients had additional health care coverage. Only 7.6% of  		patients were covered by Medicaid and 9.4% were covered by third party  		insurance carriers. Most patients were not covered by managed care  		organizations. Only 10.7% of patients across condition groups had health  		insurance through a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). Most of these  		patients had Medicare managed care as a current payment source.</p>
<p> Despite their age, the majority of patients involved in the study lived  		in their own homes (79.8% across the two condition groups). Although the  		majority of the subjects lived with an unpaid family member, nearly one-third  		lived alone. Few study subjects had safety hazards in their homes, such as  		inadequate heating/cooling, unsafe floor coverings, and lead-based paint.  		However, nearly half had structural barriers limiting independent mobility  		within their homes.</p>
<p> Consistent with Medicare home health coverage rules, the study patients  		were homebound. Although leaving home was medically contraindicated for only a  		small percentage of patients, it was challenging for all patients. For  		approximately three-quarters of the study subjects, absences from home were  		attributable solely to the need to obtain medical care. More than half of the  		patients left their homes only rarely and for slightly over one-third of the  		patients, these absences were of short duration. </p>
<p> Most patients needed assistance to leave their homes. Commonly,  		patients needed the assistance of another person or the aid of supportive  		devices. Only a small percentage of patients (less than 5%) was able to leave  		home without some sort of assistance. As expected, for nearly all patients,  		receiving medical care outside of the home was very or somewhat difficult. For  		a small percentage of patients (5.8%), the home care providers conducting the  		start of care assessments indicated that it was not difficult at all for the  		patients to receive services outside of the home. It appears that some  		episodes, representing slightly under 2% of the total episode sample, may not  		have met the requirements of the Medicare coverage rules related to homebound  		status. Patients treated during 14 episodes were rated by their care providers  		as having no difficulty receiving services outside of the home and requiring no  		assistance to leave home. For 50.0% of these patients, absences from home were  		not infrequent, for 42.9% these absences were not of short duration, and for  		78.6% absences from home were not attributable to the need to receive medical  		care. </p>
<p> Informal, unpaid caregivers are of great significance in home care.  		Nearly all study patients had family members or other persons who provided them  		with assistance of one kind or another. The vast majority of patients (98.0%)  		received assistance with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such  		as light meal preparation, transportation, and housekeeping. Further, almost  		all patients received psychosocial support, transportation, and advocacy of  		their medical care. Patients were less likely to receive assistance with  		activities of daily living (ADLs), such as grooming, bathing, and toileting  		(65.3%). Only a minority of patients received assistance with wounds or medical  		equipment from members of their family support systems.</p>
<p> Patients with CHF and those with diabetes mellitus were quite similar  		in the kinds of assistance received from their family/support systems. There  		was only one area in which these groups differed significantly. Diabetic  		patients were significantly more likely to receive assistance with wounds or  		medical equipment (which may be a reflection of the fact that diabetic patients  		were more likely than CHF patients to have surgical wounds). Although the  		majority of patients in both groups had informal caregivers who helped to  		facilitate appropriate medical care, CHF patients were marginally more likely  		to receive assistance in this area. </p>
<p> The majority of patients received assistance from a variety of people.  		Most commonly, patients were helped by one or more of their children (95.3%).  		Nearly 90% were assisted by their spouses or significant others. However, at  		times, assistance provided by a Medicare patient's spouse or partner can be  		problematic in that the informal caregiver may be just as frail and elderly as  		the patient him- or herself. Approximately, one-third of the patients received  		assistance from other family members or from friends, neighbors, or  		community/church members. Over 61% also received assistance from paid help. CHF  		patients were significantly more likely than diabetic patients to receive  		assistance from paid help and from friends, neighbors, or community/church  		members. Likewise, they were marginally more likely to receive assistance from  		family members other than their spouses/significant others and their children.  		Slightly over half of the patients were assisted by a person or persons  		residing in their home.</p>
<p> Most patients had a single person who assumed the lead responsibility  		for providing/managing the patient's care and providing the most frequent  		assistance among all informal caregivers. For slightly over one-third of the  		patients, the spouse or significant other fulfilled this role. For another  		one-third, one of the patient's children was the "primary caregiver." For 15.6%  		of the sample, this role fell to other members of the family/support group.  		</p>
<p> On average, study patients received some form of assistance from the  		primary caregiver on a daily basis. However, primary caregivers differed in  		their level of involvement in care planning and their ability to assist in  		patient care. Although three-quarters of primary caregivers were very or  		somewhat involved in the development of the patients' care plans (e.g., asking  		questions, making suggestions, identifying needs), nearly 25% were only  		minimally involved, showing little interest in and making little contribution  		to the patient's care plan. In most cases, the home care provider completing  		the start of care assessment felt that the primary caregiver had either an  		excellent or good ability to learn, which is critical to his or her ability to  		assist with the patient's home care regimen. Slightly over 12% of primary  		caregivers were rated as having only a fair or poor ability to learn. In such  		cases, home care providers may be concerned that the primary caregiver may not  		be able to follow the patient's care plan accurately. Nearly 90% of primary  		caregivers were perceived by the home care providers to have a good  		understanding of the services and eligibility requirements associated with the  		Medicare home health benefit.</p>
<p> As will be discussed in the summary of the findings from the case study  		interviews (<a href="#chapV">Chapter 5</a>), it is not uncommon for patients  		and/or their families to refuse certain types of home care services, most  		commonly aide services. For cases in which the assistance of a home health aide  		was needed, 87.3% of the primary caregivers were willing for the patient to  		receive the recommended services. The remaining 12.7%, however, were unwilling  		to have an aide assist the patients. In these cases, it is possible that the  		primary caregiver felt that these services could or should be provided by  		members of the family/support system.</p>
<p> Patients tended to be less involved in the development of their care  		plans and less capable of assisting in their care than were their primary  		caregivers. Only slightly over 59% of the patients were very or somewhat  		involved in their care plans. More than 40% were only minimally involved.  		Patients also were less capable of learning than were their primary caregivers.  		Only 12.0% of patients were believed by their home care providers to have an  		excellent ability to learn and slightly over half had a good ability to learn.  		A full 36.5% were believed to have only a fair or poor ability to learn.  		Likewise, a smaller percentage of patients than caregivers were perceived to be  		knowledgeable regarding the Medicare home health benefit. These data emphasize  		the great importance of informal caregivers in the delivery of home health  		care. In many cases, the primary caregiver may be more capable of representing  		the patient's interests and providing the necessary care than the patient him-  		or herself.</p>
<p> Of the study patients, 88.3% had experienced a medical regimen change  		and 81.6% had been discharged from an inpatient facility within 14 days of the  		beginning of their home care episodes. Nearly 70% of the patient episodes began  		following an hospital discharge. Another 6.6% of episodes began following a  		discharge from a rehabilitation facility and 5.5% followed a nursing home  		discharge. CHF patients were significantly more likely than diabetic patients  		to have been discharged from the hospital within 14 days of their home care  		start of care date, whereas diabetic patients were significantly more likely  		than CHF patients to have been discharged from a rehabilitation facility within  		that time period.</p>
<p> A variety of measures of complexity and severity were available from  		the OASIS and CPQ data. On most of these measures, it appeared that the study  		patients were in relatively good health. On average, patients had few high-risk  		factors, such as smoking, obesity, or alcohol/drug dependency, and over 80% had  		adequate or excellent nutritional status. Although 56.8% of the patients were  		believed by the home care providers to require complex management (e.g.,  		procedures more than once a day, coordination of multiple providers,  		educational instruction at each visit),<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> only one-third of patients were perceived to  		have greater than average functional assistance needs. Further, most of the  		patients seemed to have good prognoses. Nearly 90% of patients were rated as  		having good or fair overall prognoses and nearly 70% were rated has having good  		rehabilitative prognoses. </p>
<p> Aggregate ADL and IADL disability measures provide an overview of the  		functional impairment of the study patients.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> Out of the eight ADLs on which the aggregate  		ADL disability measures were calculated, the typical patient had at least a  		mild disability on four of those measures. Most patients were at least  		moderately disabled in one or two ADLs and were severely disabled in less than  		one of the eight ADLs. The average patient was at least mildly disabled in four  		of the six IADL measures included in the calculation of the aggregate measures,  		and severely disabled in two. </p>
<p> Patients with CHF and patients with diabetes mellitus did not differ  		greatly in their functional disabilities. None of the aggregate functional  		disability measures showed significant differences between patients in the two  		groups and only a small number of individual ADL and IADL measures showed such  		differences. Although CHF patients were significantly more impaired than  		diabetes patients in the areas of grooming, shopping, and management of oral  		medications, the two groups did not differ significantly on any of the other 12  		ADLs and IADLs.</p>
<p> Patients did not appear to be severely impaired in the management of  		oral medications and equipment. However, the average patient did require some  		assistance (e.g., doses prepared in advance or reminders given by another  		person) in administering inhalant/mist and injectable medications. With regard  		to the management of equipment, such as oxygen or intravenous therapy  		equipment, the average patient required considerable assistance, but was  		capable of completing some equipment management tasks independently.</p>
<p> The remainder of <a href="#table3.9"> Table 3.9</a> provides detailed  		information about the physiologic and neurologic condition of the patients  		enrolled in the study. Rather than summarizing all of the data thoroughly, the  		findings of greatest significance are reported here. On average, patients  		tended to experience shortness of breath (dyspnea) while performing activities  		requiring moderate exertion, such as dressing and walking short distances. As  		one would expect, CHF patients were more likely than their diabetic  		counterparts to experience dyspnea.</p>
<p> Sensory impairments were not common in the patient sample. Despite  		their age, the average patient had either normal or mildly impaired vision.  		Interestingly, diabetic patients were not more likely than patients with CHF to  		have impaired vision. Pain did not appear to be a major problem for the study  		patients either; the average patient experienced pain less often than daily and  		less than 10% experienced pain that was not easily relieved.</p>
<p> Integumentary problems were not unusual in the study sample. Slightly  		under one-third of the sample entered home care with a wound or lesion. For  		12.9% of the patients, one or more surgical wounds were present. A smaller  		percentage of patients experienced pressure and stasis ulcers. Diabetic  		patients were more likely than their counterparts with CHF to have any kind of  		wound or lesion, surgical wounds, and stage 2-4 ulcers. </p>
<p> Incontinence is often a problem for elderly home care patients.  		Twenty-three percent of the study patients had bladder incontinence or had been  		catheterized to manage problems with incontinence. However, few patients had  		problems with bowel incontinence or urinary tract infections. Elimination  		status did not differ by tracer condition.</p>
<p> Neurologic, emotional, and behavior problems did not appear to affect a  		large number of study patients. Behavior problems appeared to be rare in this  		sample, with only 4.1% of patients experiencing behavior problems more than  		twice a week. Moderate cognitive disability and severe confusion disability  		each affected approximately 10% of the patients in the sample. Severe anxiety  		was a problem for approximately 16% of the sample.</p>
<p> Patients were receiving home care to treat a variety of conditions,  		with the majority being treated for circulatory and  		endocrine/nutritional/metabolic diseases. As one would expect, CHF patients  		were more likely than diabetic patients to be receiving home care for  		circulatory problems and diabetes patients were more likely than CHF patients  		to be treated for endocrine/nutritional/metabolic diseases. Over one-quarter of  		all patients were receiving care related to their respiratory problems.  		Understandably, CHF patients were more likely to be receiving such care.  		Slightly more than 20% of the patients received oxygen therapy at home, a  		treatment that was much more common for the CHF patients than the diabetes  		patients.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIV" id="chapIV">IV. PRACTICE AND PRACTICE VARIATIONS IN HOME HEALTH  		CARE</a></h2>
<p> The study was designed primarily to examine the causes and consequences  		of practice variations in home health care. Data collected as part of the study  		were used to identify the patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory  		factors that influence the practice of home health care. Further, the effect of  		practice patterns on patient outcomes was examined. </p>
<p> In this chapter, the quantitative analyses regarding practice patterns  		and patient outcomes are presented. The chapter includes four sections.  		<a href="#chapIVA">Section A</a> presents descriptive information regarding the  		care provided to the study patients (e.g., length of stay, number of visits per  		discipline, care coordination activities). In <a href="#chapIVB">Section B</a>,  		the results of multivariate analyses examining the influence of patient,  		provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors on practice patterns are  		discussed. <a href="#chapIVC">Section C</a> focuses on the influence of  		practice patterns on length of stay in the Medicare home health benefit. In  		<a href="#chapIVD">Section D</a>, the effect of practice patterns on patient  		outcomes is examined. For all sections, analyses were conducted at the episode  		level with a total of 732 episodes. For those patients with more than one  		episode of care, each episode was used in the analyses. All data were collected  		under the Interim Payment System (IPS).</p>
<h3><a name="chapIVA" id="chapIVA">A. Practices in Home Health  		Care</a></h3>
<p> This section provides descriptive information about the care provided  		to the study patients. <a href="#table4.1">Table 4.1</a> presents information  		on both direct care and care coordination activities. Direct care was  		represented by length of stay, discipline mix, visits per discipline, total  		visits across disciplines, visit intensity by discipline (i.e., visits per day  		on service), visit intensity across disciplines, resource consumption,  		activities performed at each visit, and alternative services provided during  		the episode of care. </p>
<p> The mean length of stay was 41.9 days, with a median of 30.0 days. The  		six disciplines commonly involved in home health care are nurses, physical  		therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, medical  		social workers, and home care aides. In the study sample, care usually was  		provided by one or two disciplines, most commonly by nurses, followed by home  		care aides and physical therapists. Other disciplines were involved less  		frequently.</p>
<p> Nurses made 15.4 visits per episode on average, followed by home care  		aides (6.9 visits), and physical therapists (2.8 visits). The mean total number  		of visits across the six disciplines was 26.5 per episode, with a median of  		15.0. Visit intensity represents the frequency with which visits were provided  		(i.e., the number of visits provided per day). Nurses had the highest level of  		visit intensity, averaging 0.4 visits per day. The mean overall visit intensity  		across disciplines was 0.6 visits per day, with a median of 0.5.</p>

</tr></table><p> Resource consumption reflects the total cost of the visits provided to  		a patient during an episode of care and was calculated by multiplying the  		number of visits per discipline by the average cost per visit by  		discipline<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup> and  		summing the cost of all disciplines. Total resource consumption averaged  		$2201.22 per episode, with a median of $1329.44. Resource consumption  		intensity, or the average cost per day on service, averaged $54.20, with a  		median of $43.93. </p>
<p> Care providers engaged in a number of different activities at patients'  		start of care visits. On average, providers conducted four or five different  		activities at the initial visit. These activities included (ranging from  		highest to lowest rate) observation and assessment, teaching, care planning,  		coordination of care, procedures, other activities, and management and  		evaluation of the care plan. </p>
<p> Alternative services represent those services coordinated by an agency,  		but provided by another organization in the community. On the discharge Care  		Provider Questionnaire (CPQ), the home health provider identified which  		alternative services, out of 18 listed, were provided to the patient. Examples  		of such services include meals on wheels, outpatient rehabilitation,  		transportation services, homemaker or personal care services, adult day care,  		and mental health services. Of the 18 services listed, the mean number of  		alternative services provided to study patients was 0.7, ranging from zero to  		six services. The most common alternative services provided were homemaker  		services (provided during 12.2% of all study episodes), transportation  		assistance (11.4%), meals on wheels (8.9%), and personal care services (8.4%).  		A majority of patients did not receive any alternative services (57.6%).</p>
<p> Care coordination was measured by frequecy of interdisciplinary case  		conferences, number of care coordination communications, time spent on care  		coordination, and feedback regarding a patient's care plan.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> At most agencies,  		interdisciplinary case conferences occurred once a month. The number of care  		coordination communications that occurred between the receipt of the original  		referral and the start of care visit averaged 3.8. On average, the nurse or  		therapist spent 31.2 minutes coordinating with other care providers involved  		with a given patient. It was not uncommon for a care provider to receive  		feedback from other agency personnel regarding a patient's care plan.  		Specifically, care providers received feedback on the frequency with which  		skilled nursing visits should be provided (42.6% of providers received such  		input), the necessity for home health aide services (26%), and the  		appropriateness of discharging the patient (54.9%). The mean overall level of  		feedback was 0.4, on a scale from zero to one. </p>
<h3><a name="chapIVB" id="chapIVB">B. Causes of Practice Variation in  		Home Health Care</a></h3>
<p> In this section of the report, the influence of patient, provider,  		agency, and market/regulatory factors on practice patterns is summarized. Five  		important aspects of home health practice, covering direct care provision and  		care coordination, were selected for examination. Four measures of direct care  		investigated were (1) the average number of visits provided per day (i.e.,  		visit intensity), (2) the duration of the home health episode (length of  		stay),<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup> (3) the total  		number of disciplines involved in patient care, and (4) the number of  		alternative services provided during the episode of care. The amount of  		feedback received by the primary home care provider from other agency personnel  		regarding a patient's care plan and discharge was examined as a measure of care  		coordination.</p>
<p> As described in detail in <a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a>, the analyses  		assessing the impact of patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory  		factors on home health agency practices were conducted using ordinary least  		squares (OLS) regression. For each practice pattern variable, four preliminary  		OLS models were conducted to identify the patient, provider, agency, and  		market/regulatory factors, respectively, that significantly or marginally  		effect each practice pattern. These variables were then combined into a single  		final OLS model, examining the impact of all factors simultaneously.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup><a href="#table4.2">Table  		4.2</a> presents the results of the five final OLS models investigating the  		effect of patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors on the five  		practice patterns of interest.</p>
<h4>1. Influence of Patient Factors on Home Care Practices  		</h4>
<p> Patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory variables had an  		important effect on the four measures of direct patient care. As one would  		expect, patient factors were particularly strong predictors of home health  		practices. Patient demographic characteristics were important influences on  		some of the practice patterns. Although age was not a significant predictor of  		three of the four direct care measures, it was significantly related to visit  		intensity. Contrary to what one might expect, however, older patients received  		significantly fewer visits per day on average than younger patients. This  		effect is likely a result of the particular characteristics of the older  		patients in the study. Although these patients were more functionally impaired  		than their younger counterparts, their medical conditions tended to be less  		complex. Older patients were significantly less likely to be rated by their  		care providers as requiring complex management than were younger patients.  		Further, these patients had significantly fewer comorbid conditions, calculated  		as the number of diagnoses severe enough to affect daily functioning for which  		home care was being provided. In addition, older patients were significantly or  		marginally less likely to have certain conditions or receive certain therapies  		that might result in more frequent visits (e.g., open wounds or lesions,  		infusion therapy, enteral nutrition, ventilator therapy). Some, but not all of  		these variables were controlled in the multivariate analyses. </p>

</tr></table><p> Although gender did not appear to influence care practices, race was an  		important predictor of length of stay and the number of alternative services  		provided.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> White  		patients had significantly shorter home care episodes and were provided with a  		marginally larger number of alternative services than were non-White patients.  		These two effects could be closely linked to one another. That is, patients who  		receive a large number of alternative services - services that are likely to  		continue after a patient's discharge from the home care agency - may be ready  		for discharge earlier than other patients because their remaining needs are met  		by outside organizations and do not need to be met by the home care agency  		itself.</p>
<p> With regard to the effect of race on length of stay and the receipt of  		alternative services, White study patients might have been more likely to live  		in those geographic regions where alternative services were more likely to be  		available. Further, these patients might have entered home care as a result of  		more acute, rather than chronic, illness. Indeed, White study patients were  		marginally less likely than non-White patients to be rated by their care  		providers as requiring complex management. </p>
<p> Payment issues appeared to have little impact on all but one of the  		practice pattern variables. Whether a patient was covered by Medicaid or by a  		Medicare Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) was only predictive of the  		provision of alternative services. Patients with Medicaid or a Medicare HMO as  		a payer were more likely to receive services from organizations outside of the  		home care agency. These effects likely are due to different mechanisms. </p>
<p> Medicaid patients may receive more alternative services for a variety  		of reasons. States that provide coverage for home health care through their  		respective Medicaid programs may be more likely to make other services  		available as well. Therefore, patients living in these states may have a larger  		array of services available to them than patients living in states with less  		generous Medicaid programs. Further, agency personnel may more actively attempt  		to coordinate alternative services for those patients they know will not be  		able to fund such care independently. It may be especially important for agency  		staff to establish these services for patients with limited financial resources  		than for patients who would be able to locate and pay for these services  		themselves.</p>
<p> Patients receiving care through a Medicare HMO also received more  		alternative services than other patients. HMOs of all varieties are known for  		their parsimonious use of medical resources and their involvement of case  		managers in determining appropriate patient care. It is possible that agency  		staff caring for Medicare HMO patients were more likely to coordinate  		alternative services in order to compensate for agency services that the HMO  		had not approved or might not approve.</p>
<p> Although financial factors limiting patients' ability to meet basic  		health needs did not appear to influence direct care provision, they did  		influence care coordination. Care providers received significantly more  		feedback from other agency personnel about the patient care plan when the  		patient had financial factors limiting his or her ability to meet basic health  		needs than when no financial limitations were present. Patients with more  		problems, including financial problems, appear to have required greater  		coordination among care providers.</p>
<p> Patient living situation was an important predictor of home care  		practices. Living alone was a particularly important predictor of both direct  		care provision and care coordination. Patients who lived alone received  		significantly more frequent visits, had significantly more home care  		disciplines involved in their care (and significantly greater feedback among  		these providers), and received significantly more alternative services.  		Although patients living alone were significantly less functionally impaired  		than those living with others (likely the reason they were able to live alone  		in the first place), they were marginally older, had significantly fewer types  		of people in their informal support systems providing them with  		assistance,<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> received  		significantly less frequent assistance from their primary caregivers, and thus  		had significantly more unmet needs at start of care. Similarly, controlling for  		living situation, patients who received less frequent assistance from their  		primary caregivers were provided with a significantly larger number of  		alternative services to compensate for this missing assistance. These findings  		emphasize the importance of a patient's family/support system in determining  		the care provided by a home health agency. </p>
<p> CPQ data were used to assess the degree to which a study patient was  		homebound. A patient's limitations in leaving the home and in receiving medical  		care outside the home were used to predict care practices. Although the former  		variable did not appear to influence care practices, while controlling for  		other important patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory variables,  		difficulty receiving services outside of the home did predict the number of  		alternative services provided. Patients for whom it was more difficult to  		receive services outside of the home received significantly more alternative  		services during their episodes of care. Again, agency staff may be using  		alternative services to compensate for services the patient would be unlikely  		to receive if he or she had to leave the home to obtain them.</p>
<p> Patients requiring aide services had significantly more frequent  		visits, more disciplines involved in their care, and more alternative services  		provided. It is possible that patients needing aide services received care from  		more disciplines and more frequent visits simply because they received care  		from both nurses and aides, whereas many patients received care from only a  		single discipline (43.5%). However, patients identified by their primary care  		providers at start of care as needing aide services had significantly more  		complex needs and more serious functional disabilities than did those patients  		who did not require aide services. For example, patients needing aide services  		were significantly older, more likely to have financial problems limiting their  		ability to meet their basic health needs, required significantly more  		assistance to leave the home, had significantly more unmet needs at start of  		care, and had a significantly larger number of comorbid conditions impacting  		their daily functioning. Likewise, regardless of the need for aide services,  		patients identified as requiring complex management received significantly more  		frequent visits, had marginally more disciplines involved in their care, and  		thus required significantly more feedback about their care among their care  		providers, than did less complex patients.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup></p>
<p> A recent inpatient discharge appeared to strongly influence care  		practices. Patients discharged from a hospital within 14 days of the beginning  		of their home health episodes were likely to receive care from a significantly  		larger number of disciplines than were other patients. Those discharged from a  		nursing home or rehabilitation facility within 14 days of start of home care  		received significantly more frequency visits, had significantly longer  		episodes, and received care from a significantly larger number of disciplines.  		It appears that patients recently discharged from an inpatient facility may  		have particularly complex needs, requiring frequent care by a number of home  		health care providers. Episode lengths may be elongated not only as a result of  		this complexity, but also as a result of the need to educate the patient and  		family caregivers about new conditions that may have been the cause of  		inpatient admission, and new medical treatments and medication regimens that  		were developed during those inpatient stays. Nurses interviewed during the case  		studies (see <a href="#chapV">Chapter 5</a>) commented on the particular  		frailty of newly discharged hospital patients and the need to strengthen these  		patients physically before they will be able learn about their conditions and  		treatments. These nurses also noted that hospital patients do not always  		receive adequate education prior to being discharged.</p>
<p> As one would expect, functional status and rehabilitative prognosis  		were important predictors of care practices. Patients with greater functional  		disability received significantly more frequent visits, and received care from  		a significantly larger number of disciplines and alternative services, and thus  		required greater feedback amongst their care providers regarding their care  		plans.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup> Contrary to  		what one might expect, patients with a poor rehabilitative prognosis received  		care from marginally fewer disciplines than did patients with a better  		rehabilitative outlook. It is likely, however, that home care nurses recommend  		the involvement of physical or occupational therapists for those patients they  		perceive as having the possibility of rehabilitative improvement. Indeed,  		nurses involved in the case study interviews summarized in <a href="#chapV">Chapter 5</a> reported that they do not order therapy for all  		patients who might need it, but instead for those patients they perceive will  		benefit from and are motivated to participate in such care.</p>
<p> Patient diagnoses and conditions influenced the kind of care received,  		particularly the number of disciplines involved in care. Specifically, patients  		having at least one stage 1-4 ulcer, nervous system diseases, musculoskeletal  		system diseases, and patients with fractures received care from significantly  		more disciplines than did patients not having these conditions.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup> Patients with at least one  		stage 1-4 ulcer also received significantly more frequent visits. For these  		patients as well as patients with musculoskeletal system diseases, care  		providers received significantly more feedback from other care agency personnel  		about the patients' care plans. Presumably, the impact of ulcers on care visit  		intensity and number of disciplines results from the use of home health aides  		to assist with wound care and dressing changes. Patients with congestive heart  		failure (CHF) had marginally longer episode lengths than did patients without  		CHF. Patients with mental diseases received significantly fewer alternative  		resources than did other patients. It is possible that patients with serious  		mental disorders are less capable of identifying and expressing their needs,  		and that home care nurses are therefore less likely to attempt to coordinate  		services to meet these needs.</p>
<h4>2. Influence of Provider Factors on Home Care  		Practices</h4>
<p> Characteristics of the medical care providers were much less strongly  		associated with care practices. The use of a standardized care plan at the  		start of care visit and the home care provider's highest level of education did  		not predict any of the direct care measures. However, the use of a standardized  		care plan was significantly related to the amount of feedback a care provider  		received from other agency personnel regarding a patient's care plan.  		Specifically, for patients with which a standardized care plan was used at the  		start of care visit, providers reported having received significantly more  		feedback from other agency personnel about the patient's plan of care than did  		providers who had not used a standardized care plan at the start of care visit.  		This relationship may reflect a general acceptance of feedback and assistance  		in care planning among a certain group of care providers. Nurses (or  		therapists) who are willing to use a standardized care plan, rather than  		relying solely on their own judgment, may also be more willing to seek and/or  		receive the input of other care providers about a case.</p>
<p> The years of experience of the home care provider conducting the start  		of care visit and the involvement of the patient's physician in the care plan  		did have some impact on care practices. Patients whose start of care  		assessments were conducted by a care provider who had been involved in home  		care for many years had significantly longer lengths of stay than did patients  		whose start of care assessments were conducted by less experienced care  		providers.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup> Two  		possible explanations for this effect exist. First, it is reasonable to expect  		that more experienced care providers might be assigned to more challenging  		patients, requiring treatment that is more complex and longer episodes of care.  		(Although many patient factors are controlled in these analyses, patient  		complexity may not be completely captured.) However, there is little evidence  		that this is the case. Years of home health experience is not correlated with  		patient need for complex management, number of comorbid conditions, or other  		measures that can be used to examine patient complexity. </p>
<p> The second, and seemingly more likely, explanation for the effect of  		care provider experience on length of stay relates to style of practice. Care  		providers who have been in the home health business for a number of years  		learned how to provide home care during a time of greater home health  		prosperity and lesser concern regarding financial issues. Nurses (and  		therapists) who were in practice during the 1980s and early 1990s may focus on  		doing what they consider to be best for the patient with little consideration  		for cost. They also may proceed with planning and implementing care in a more  		autonomous manner, as might have been more common prior to the rise in  		prevalence of managed care organizations and case management techniques.  		Indeed, it appears that care providers with more years of experience in home  		health care are less likely than their less experienced counterparts to use  		standardized care plans and more likely to report that the patient's physician  		is only minimally involved in the patient's care, implying that the care plan  		has been primarily or solely the responsibility of the home care provider.</p>
<p> As mentioned previously, physician involvement also is related to some  		extent to care practices. Specifically, the more involved the patient's  		physician, the more frequently visits are provided to the patient.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup> It is possible that this effect  		is a result of patient complexity that is not fully accounted for in the  		regression model. That is, patients with particularly complex needs may receive  		more visits from their home care agencies, while also receiving more  		supervision of this care from their physicians.</p>
<h4>3. Influence of Agency Factors on Home Care  		Practices</h4>
<p> Agency factors were more prominent predictors of practice patterns than  		were provider factors.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup> Agency ownership and type were particularly  		influential. Controlling of other patient, provider, agency, and  		market/regulatory factors, proprietary agencies had significantly higher visit  		intensity, shorter length of stay, more use of alternative services, and a  		higher level of feedback among agency personnel about patient care. It may be  		that these agencies attempt to restrict episode lengths without restricting  		services dramatically by providing services over a shorter period of time,  		resulting in higher visit intensity. It also is possible that proprietary  		agencies specifically select acute care patients, who may need more frequent  		services in the short run, but who can be discharged after fairly short  		episodes. Proprietary agencies involved in the study appear to have made use of  		alternative services more so than did nonproprietary agencies. Perhaps  		proprietary agencies attempt to cut costs by outsourcing the care for certain  		of their patients' needs. It is possible that care providers receive a good  		deal of input from other agency personnel as a result of identifying the need  		for and coordinating these alternative services.</p>
<p> Hospital-based agencies also made use of alternative services provided  		in the community, significantly more so than did freestanding agencies.  		Further, hospital-based agencies had significantly shorter lengths of stay and  		marginally lower visit intensity than their freestanding counterparts. Unlike  		proprietary agencies, hospital-based agencies do not appear to counterbalance  		episode length and visit frequency. This effect also could be a result of  		patient case mix that is not fully accounted for by the patient variables  		included in the regression models.</p>
<p> Agencies in operation for a longer period of time tended to use  		significantly more alternative services in the care of their patients than did  		newer agencies. It may be that staff at long-standing agencies are simply more  		aware of the resources available in the surrounding community and therefore are  		more likely to take advantage of them.</p>
<p> Whether or not an agency was over or under the Medicare per-visit and  		per-beneficiary cost limits was predictive of length of stay. Agencies that  		were over the per-visit limit had significantly shorter episode lengths than  		did agencies that were under the limit. Further, care providers in these  		agencies reported receiving marginally less feedback from other agency  		personnel than did care providers in agencies not over the per-visit limit. It  		appears that agencies over the per-visit limit may have attempted to cut costs  		by keeping episodes relatively short, thus providing fewer visits. The shorter  		episode lengths may reduce the likelihood of substantial feedback being shared  		amongst care providers. Conversely, agencies that were over their  		per-beneficiary limits had significantly longer home care episodes than  		agencies that were not over their limits. It may be that a tendency to keep  		patients on service for long periods of time was the reason that these agencies  		were over their per-beneficiary limits in the first place and that these  		agencies had not yet adjusted to the new cost limits by reducing  		utilization.</p>
<p> The percentage of an agency's caseload that is represented by Medicare  		patients had a strong impact on length of stay and visit intensity. Agencies  		with a larger percentage of Medicare patients provided significantly longer  		home care episodes and significantly fewer visits per day. Given that Medicare  		patients are likely to be older and more chronically ill than non-Medicare  		patients, it may be that these patients require regular care over a longer  		period of time. Younger patients may be more likely to have acute problems,  		such as surgical wounds, requiring frequent care over a short period of  		time.</p>
<p> Standards regarding nurse productivity and care planning tend to  		increase length of stay. Agencies that had nurse productivity standards  		specifying the number of visits a nurse should conduct during the course of a  		day provided their patients with significantly longer episodes of care than did  		agencies without nurse productivity standards in place. It is possible that  		agencies are counterbalancing episode length with visit length. In order to  		make the required number of patient visits each day, home care nurses may have  		to constrain the length of time they spend with each patient. (Nurses involved  		in the case study interviews noted that increased burdens in terms of  		documentation and productivity standards often reduced the amount of time they  		were able to spend with a given patient.) In order to provide the needed care  		to a patient, while keeping each visit short, providers may need to see the  		maintain the patient on service over a longer episode. </p>
<p> Agencies that use standardized care plans when planning and providing  		patient care also had significantly longer episode lengths than did agencies  		without such standards. At first glance, this effect may seem unexpected. One  		might assume that care plans are intended, in part, to reduce unnecessary  		utilization of services. However, these care plans also may serve to ensure  		that nurses provide appropriate care, regardless of utilization. The use of a  		standardized care plan may prevent both inappropriate over- and  		underutilization of services. Agencies that used standardized care plans also  		tended to have significantly more feedback amongst care providers about care  		provision. Both the use of care plans and the frequency of provider feedback  		may result from a general atmosphere of team decision making, rather than a  		focus on the supremacy of the "primary nurse" for making all care plan  		decisions.</p>
<p> Although the rural/urban location of patients and the frequency of  		interdisciplinary communication had no impact on direct care, each of these  		variables significantly influenced the amount of feedback a care provider  		received about his or her patient's care plan.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup> Agencies caring primarily for patients  		living in rural areas had significantly more feedback among care providers than  		did agencies treating a more urban patient population. Perhaps the remote  		location of rural patients and agencies required more communication among care  		providers in order to assure proper care coordination. As one would expect,  		care providers in agencies in which interdisciplinary communication occurs more  		frequently reported receiving significantly more feedback about their patients'  		care plans than did providers in agencies which less frequent cross-provider  		communication. </p>
<p> Finally, agencies with a larger number of annual admissions provided  		their patients with significantly fewer alternative services than did agencies  		with fewer admissions. It is likely that agencies with a larger number of  		admissions are larger agencies, with more substantial staff resources.  		Alternative services may not be utilized by such agencies because they may be  		able to provide all of these services through the agency.</p>
<h4>4. Influence of Market/Regulatory Factors on Home Care  		Practices</h4>
<p> Market/regulatory variables also were important in predicting  		variations in home health practices. Agencies in high-volume states provided  		significantly more frequent visits to their patients, and involved a marginally  		larger number of disciplines and a marginally smaller number of alternative  		services in the care of their patients than did agencies in the low-volume  		states. (Likely as a result of the increased number of care providers and  		alternative services involved, providers in these agencies reported  		significantly more feedback from other agency personnel about their patients'  		care plans.) As state trends in per patient visit volume demonstrate (see  		<a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>), agencies in the low-volume states have long  		provided care in a more parsimonious manner than have agencies in the  		high-volume states. Controlling for many patient, provider, agency, and other  		market/regulatory factors, it appears that the study agencies continue to  		follow these patterns. The marginally more frequent use of alternative services  		in the low-volume states may reflect an attempt by agencies to reduce their  		utilization further by obtaining care for their patients through other  		community organizations.</p>
<p> Although living in an MSA had no impact on the care a patient received,  		state per capita income was significantly related to length of stay and amount  		of feedback received by the care provider from other agency personnel.  		Specifically, patients in states with higher per capita incomes tended to be on  		service for shorter periods of time. Likely as a result of these shorter  		episodes, there was significantly less feedback from other agency personnel  		about the patients' care plans in states with high per capita incomes. In these  		areas, communities may have more resources, reducing the necessity for patients  		to rely on the Medicare home health benefit. Patients themselves may be more  		affluent and may have the ability to obtain services in other ways. Further, as  		discussed in <a href="#chapI">Chapter 1</a>, previous research (Schore 1994)  		has demonstrated that certain regions of the country have both a more  		impoverished and a more chronically ill population, whereas certain regions are  		more affluent and have mainly patients with more acute needs. It is possible  		that patients in more impoverished states do not receive medical assistance  		until their needs become relatively severe, explaining the longer lengths of  		stay in states with lower per capita incomes.</p>
<p> Community resources also were fairly strong predictors of home care  		practices. The number of resources available within an agency's community was  		significantly related to both visit intensity and number of disciplines  		involved in care.<sup><font><a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup> In  		communities in which a larger number of community resources were available,  		patients received significantly more frequent visits and care was provided by  		significantly more disciplines. Again, these results may be tied to community  		affluence and patient case mix. Patients in geographic areas that can afford to  		provide a large number of alternative services may require high intensity, but  		short-term care (e.g., wound care following surgery). Likewise, in areas with a  		large number of nursing home beds per elderly person, significantly fewer  		alternative services were provided to home care patients. It may be that fewer  		alternative resources are available as a result of a focus on providing  		accessible nursing home care in these areas.</p>
<h3><a name="chapIVC" id="chapIVC">C. Effect of Practice Patterns on Home  		Health Episode Length</a></h3>
<p> One of the key study goals was to identify practice patterns leading to  		long or short lengths of stay in home health care. <a href="#table4.3">Table  		4.3</a> presents the results of the OLS regression model used to examine the  		influence of direct care (i.e., visit intensity, number of disciplines,  		alternative services, and amount of feedback received from other care providers  		regarding the patient's care plan) and care coordination on episode duration.  		Important patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors were  		included in this model to control for these other influences on length of  		stay.<sup><font><a href="#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p> In the model, two of the four practice patterns significantly  		influenced length of stay. Patients who received more frequent visits had  		significantly shorter episode lengths than did patients with less frequent  		visits. As discussed above, it may be that some agencies counterbalance episode  		length with visit frequency (i.e., visit intensity). Depending on staff  		resources, some agencies may be better able to handle cases requiring more  		frequent visits, whereas other agencies may be better able to adjust their  		staff resources to meet the demands of long episodes with less frequent visits.  		For example, agencies with smaller staffs may be less able to provide frequent  		visits to their patients. To compensate for less frequent visits, agency  		personnel may lengthen patient episodes to ensure all the patients' needs are  		met. </p>
<p> The inverse relationship between visit intensity and length of stay  		also may result from patient case mix differences that are not completely  		controlled by the patient factor variables included in the model. As suggested  		previously, patients with acute medical problems (e.g., patients requiring  		wound care following inpatient hospitalization) may require frequent visits to  		accommodate their immediate health care needs. However, their acute needs may  		be met and these patients may be ready for discharge after only a short time on  		service with their home health care agencies. A more chronically ill patient  		may require less frequent visits over a longer period of time to allow home  		care staff to monitor and manage his or her chronic illness. Further, such  		patients may require more extensive education than patients with short-term  		medical needs.</p>
<p> The number of disciplines involved in a patient's care also was  		associated with episode length. Episodes that involved more disciplines were  		significantly longer than episodes with a smaller number of disciplines  		involved. Again, this finding could be a result of patient case mix differences  		that are not fully controlled in the regression model. Patients of greater  		complexity may require both the services of multiple disciplines and longer  		episodes of home health care.</p>
<p> On the other hand, the relationship between the number of disciplines  		and length of stay may represent a general practice culture of high or low  		utilization. Controlling for case mix, certain agencies may be prone to  		providing patients with a large number of services over a long period of time.  		Other agencies may have a more parsimonious approach to care provision.  		Previous research has suggested that, even after controlling for substantial  		variations in case mix, large regional variations in home health practice still  		exist (OIG 1995a; Schore 1994). It appears that such variations continued under  		the Interim Payment System (IPS).</p>
<p> Controlling for important patient, provider, agency, and  		market/regulatory factors, the number of alternative services provided to a  		patient did not predict length of stay. One might have expected that agencies  		might coordinate alternative services in order to allow for earlier discharge  		of their patients. Although findings discussed in <a href="#chapIVB">Section  		B</a> suggest that agency personnel may attempt to cut costs by coordinating  		alternative services rather than having those services provided by the agencies  		themselves, it does not appear that agencies are able to discharge patients  		more quickly as a result.</p>
<p> The amount of feedback a care provider received from other agency  		personnel about a patient's care plan also did not predict length of stay. It  		was expected that nurses (and therapists) might receive feedback from case  		managers or others whose objective was to ensure that resources were not  		overutilized during the course of an episode of care. Such feedback might lead  		care providers to discharge patients earlier than they might have otherwise.  		However, this did not appear to be the case. Controlling for patient, provider,  		agency, market/regulatory, and other practice pattern variables, feedback  		appeared to have no impact on length of stay. Perhaps the feedback received by  		care providers was primarily from other care providers whose focus was on the  		quality of the care plan rather than on utilization of services. As noted in  		<a href="#chapV">Chapter 5</a>, some of the nurses involved in the case study  		interviews reported that, although their agency administrators were focused on  		financial issues, the nursing staff was allowed to plan and provide care based  		on patient need rather than cost concerns.</p>
<h3><a name="chapIVD" id="chapIVD">D. Patient Outcome of Home Health  		Care</a></h3>
<p> Another important goal of the study was to examine the relationship  		between agency practices and patient outcome. Patient outcome was measured as  		the percentage of the standard improvement measures reported on the Centers for  		Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) outcome reports on which a patient  		improved.<sup><font><a href="#note43">43</a></font></sup><a href="#table4.4">Table 4.4</a> presents the results of an OLS regression  		model predicting patient outcome from practice patterns, while controlling for  		important patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory variables.</p>
<p> As is evident from <a href="#table4.4">Table 4.4</a>, practice patterns  		were not strong predictors of patient outcome. Notably, length of stay, the  		number of disciplines involved in care, and the number of alternative services  		provided did not appear to influence outcome for the study patients. Two other  		variables did marginally predict patient outcome. Visit intensity, or the  		number of visits provided per day, was marginally related to patient outcome,  		such that the more frequently visits were provided, the better the patient  		outcome. This effect was apparent even after important patient factors such as  		rehabilitative prognosis, complexity, and comorbidities were controlled in the  		model, suggesting that visit intensity had an independent impact on the outcome  		of home care patients. It appears that more frequent visits may allow care  		providers to maintain a more accurate understanding of a patient's condition  		and to be made quickly aware of any changes or declines in patient  		condition.</p>
<p> The amount of feedback a care provider received from other agency  		personnel about a patient's care plan had an unexpected relationship with  		patient outcome. Controlling for important patient, provider, agency,  		market/regulatory, and other practice pattern variables, more feedback received  		by a care provider was marginally related to worse patient outcome. Again,  		although many patient factors were accounted for in the model, this finding  		might suggest that patients who were sicker to begin with both were the subject  		of more discussion among care providers, and were less likely to achieve  		positive outcomes as a result of care.</p>

<p> As noted in <a href="#chapI">Chapter 1</a>, the study was designed in  		part to examine practice and decision making in home health care. Focus group  		and case study interviews were two methods used to gather qualitative data to  		address these topics. The focus group interviews were designed primarily to  		explore how home care decisions are made in light of Medicare coverage rules.  		Focus group discussion concentrated on issues surrounding the decision to  		recertify or discharge two hypothetical patients. The case study interviews, on  		the other hand, were designed primarily to provide a description of the  		practice of home health care by interviewing nurses regarding recently  		completed patient episodes. During the case study interviews, the care patterns  		and care coordination activities for seven actual CHF patients were reviewed.  		Although the focus group and case study interviews were designed primarily to  		elicit information on different topics (i.e., decision making and practice,  		respectively), these methods overlapped to some degree in the issues they  		addressed. Information about provider perspectives on IPS and changes in home  		health care also was collected during the focus group and case study  		interviews. This information is summarized in <a href="#chapVI"> Chapter  		6</a>.</p>
<p> It is important to note that the findings from the focus group and case  		study interviews are necessarily limited by the size and composition of their  		samples. Focus groups were conducted with four to seven individuals at each of  		eight home care agencies. Case study interviews were conducted with a single  		person at each of seven agencies. The participants in both sets of interviews  		were home health care nurses. As stakeholders in the industry, home health  		nurses may feel negatively toward new federal policies and regulations designed  		to restrain the dramatic growth in home health utilization and spending.  		Further, because their focus is on providing care to patients, many home care  		nurses may not be fully aware of the historical context and goals underpinning  		new policies and payment structures.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVA" id="chapVA">A. Focus Group Interviews</a></h3>
<p> The eight focus groups were designed to examine decision making in home  		health care, focusing specifically on how decisions are made in light of  		Medicare coverage rules. In this section, the data from the focus group  		interviews are used to explore several factors that influence the process of  		decision making in home health care: (1) patient and caregiver factors (e.g.,  		living environment), (2) the actors involved in the decision-making process  		(e.g., primary nurses, Fiscal Intermediaries [FIs]), (3) agency factors (e.g.,  		supervision of the decision-making process), (4) external factors (e.g.,  		managed care), and (5) Medicare coverage rules. </p>
<p> Data related to each of the factors that influence decision making in  		home health care were examined for patterns associated with state volume,  		agency ownership, agency type, and patient vignette. No differences were found  		between agencies in the different volume, ownership, and type categories.  		However, some of the focus group responses were related to the specific  		circumstances of the two hypothetical patients presented in the patient  		vignettes. Vignette-specific information is reported when appropriate.  		<a href="#vignette1">Vignette 1</a> and <a href="#vignette2">Vignette 2</a>,  		which are shown in their entirety in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>, are  		summarized below.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><strong><a name="vignette1" id="vignette1">Vignette 1</a></strong> Mrs.  			 Smith is an 86 year old woman living alone in a two-story unheated house.

<h4>1. Patient and Caregiver Factors</h4>
<p> Patient factors play an important role in the decision-making process  		regarding recertification and discharge. The patient factors most often  		mentioned by focus group participants included the following: (a) homebound  		status and the need for skilled services, (b) medication management, (c)  		alternative resources, (d) patient knowledge, (e) living environment, (f)  		financial status, (g) patient health status, and (h) caregiver factors.  		Participants' comments regarding each of these factors are summarized  		below.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Homebound Status and the Need for Skilled  		Services</strong></i>: Participants in all of the focus groups acknowledged  		that decisions to recertify or discharge a patient rest on the patient's  		homebound status and need for skilled services. Nurses mentioned these two  		factors in their discussion of patient factors, agency factors, and Medicare  		coverage rules. Therefore, the discussion of homebound status and the need for  		skilled services is consolidated under item 5 (Medicare Coverage Rules) of this  		section.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Medication Management</strong></i>: A patient's ability to  		manage his or her medication regimen was described by focus group participants  		at all eight agencies as an important factor in assessing the patient's  		readiness for discharge. A primary role of the home health nurse is to provide  		medication management education to the patient and his or her caregiver. As  		cognitive functioning is critical to the ability to perform medication  		management, the focus group participants highlighted the need for care  		providers to assess the cognitive ability of the patient and caregiver. This  		assessment of education and skills includes examining the patient or  		caregiver's ability to correctly read a glucometer, fill syringes and/or  		pillboxes, and recognize important signs and symptoms of medication  		complications. Several nurses indicated that patient or caregiver independence  		in these activities is very important because some of these activities (e.g.,  		filling pillboxes) are not considered skilled services and thus patients cannot  		be recertified on the basis of these needs alone.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Alternative Resources</strong></i>: The identification of  		alternative resources was considered important by the members of each of the  		focus groups. The majority of the focus group participants indicated that one  		of their primary responsibilities as home care nurses is to find alternative  		resources for their patients. They do so by locating people, such as neighbors  		and volunteers, who can help with the patient's needs (e.g., grocery shopping)  		as well as by utilizing social work services to assist in assessing patient  		needs and making appropriate referrals. A few nurses indicated that they might  		recertify a patient for a short time until alternative services were in place.  		However, such recertifications are quite rare as planning for these services  		normally begins the very first day of a home health care episode and is  		accomplished long before the recertification decision is made.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Patient Knowledge</strong></i>: The role of patient  		education in home health care was a primary point of discussion at all of the  		focus groups. The nurses described the teaching process as a skilled service  		that involves educating the patient about the disease process, risk factors,  		signs and symptoms of complications, how to manage symptoms, and when to call a  		nurse or physician. When changes occur in a patient's condition or care plan  		(e.g., new diagnoses or medications), the teaching process often has to be  		repeated. The need for additional education resulting from such changes was  		considered a reason for recertification.</p>
<p> Educational priorities are dependent on the specific needs of each  		patient. With regard to hypothetical patient Mrs. Smith, the focus group  		participants emphasized the need to educate her about the signs and symptoms of  		acute exacerbation of CHF and when to call for help. In Mr. Lucas' case, a  		major goal of home health care is to stabilize his blood sugar. Home care  		providers would accomplish this goal by teaching him what to eat, how to  		measure his insulin, and how to recognize signs and symptoms of high and low  		blood sugar.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Living Environment</strong></i>: Nurses at all eight  		agencies emphasized the importance of a patient's living environment. For  		example, the focus group participants expressed concern about Mrs. Smith  		because she does not have heat and she may be at risk of falling down the  		stairs in her home. Most participants indicated that concerns about a patient's  		living environment are not necessarily justification for recertification.  		However, the participants suggested that a social worker should be contacted or  		community resources (e.g., a 24-hour care service) identified for a patient  		with unresolved safety issues in the home. The focus group participants  		indicated that safety and living environment issues generally are addressed  		early in a home health care episode and are resolved before recertification  		decisions are made. For this reason, it is unusual to recertify a patient  		solely on the basis of an unsafe living environment. However, it might be  		necessary to do so for a short time until community resources are identified to  		address the patient's needs.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Financial Status</strong></i>: Participants in five of the  		focus groups stated that the patient's financial status is a factor that home  		care nurses consider when making decisions about recertification and discharge.  		However, it was noted that a patient's financial difficulties alone cannot  		justify recertification. The participants indicated that, prior to discharge,  		home health agencies should use the services of a social worker to identify  		community organizations that can provide financial assistance.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Status</strong></i>: Focus group participants at each  		of the agencies reported that the patient's health status is one of the most  		important factors nurses consider in making decisions about recertification and  		discharge. The participants focused primarily on the patient's physical health  		and cognitive functioning.</p>
<p> Participants discussed a number of important indicators of a patient's  		physical health. They emphasized that a patient's medical condition must be  		stable before discharge. Such stability denotes that the patient no longer is  		in need of skilled nursing services. Many participants reported that they would  		recertify a patient whose medical condition had worsened since the start of  		care. Participants also stressed (as noted earlier) the importance of a  		patient's ability to manage his or her own medications. With regard to both of  		the patient vignettes, participants reported that they would use the following  		indicators of the patients' physical condition to assess readiness for  		discharge: presence of edema or swelling, skin breakdown and ulceration, weight  		gain or loss, and ability to ambulate. </p>
<p> When discussing the importance of a patient's physical health in the  		decision-making process, participants focused on many aspects of health that  		were specific to the two patient vignettes and the medical conditions  		represented in them. The physical health indicators discussed for each  		hypothetical patient and medical condition are detailed below. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><strong>Mrs. Smith (CHF)</strong>
<ul><li>Lightheadedness</li>
<li>Shortness of breath (e.g., oxygen use, oxygen saturations)</li>
<li>Coughing, wheezing, crackling</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Hearing</li>
<li>Vision</li>
<li>Ability to dress herself (need for assistive equipment)</li>
<li>Energy conservation, increased fatigue </li>
<li>Increased abdominal girth</li>
<li>Waking up often at night</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="bordered-text"><strong>Mr. Lucas (Diabetes Mellitus)</strong>
<ul><li>Vision and presence of retinopathy</li>
<li>Presence of peripheral vascular disease secondary to diabetes  				  mellitus</li>
<li>Need for assistive devices</li>

<li>Need for and ability to use compression hose </li>
<li>Cardiac problems associated with diabetes mellitus</li>
<li>Diabetic foot care</li>
<li>Nutrition and hydration</li>
<li>Ability to use glucometer</li>
<li>Ability to self-administer insulin</li>
</ul></div>
<p> Participants also expressed concern about the hypothetical patients'  		cognitive functioning. Cognitive functioning was viewed as important not only  		for medication management, but also for other personal care and safety. Other  		concerns about recent cognitive changes were case-specific. Because  		hypothetical patient Mrs. Smith recently has begun to forget to take her  		medications, the participants expressed some concern that she might need a  		cognitive evaluation. Some of the participants suggested the need for community  		services to assist Mrs. Smith should she have a cognitive deficit. However, if  		Mrs. Smith's cognition were not impaired, many focus group participants felt  		she would have to be discharged given the stability of her other symptoms.</p>
<p> Participants believed that hypothetical patient Mr. Lucas should  		undergo a cognitive evaluation because of his recent inability to process  		instructions. Because cognitive difficulties are sometimes the result of  		infection, many of the focus group participants suggested that specific blood  		work should be performed. Participants recommended checking for a urinary tract  		infection and other kidney problems, as diabetics are at high risk for such  		complications.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Caregiver Factors</strong></i>: Caregiver factors were  		discussed by participants during each of the focus groups. Nurses stressed the  		importance of caregiver availability and burden, as well as education and  		ability to learn. The availability of a caregiver was a topic of discussion at  		all of the focus groups. As mentioned above, some of the focus group  		participants noted that they might recertify a patient until a caregiver could  		be found or community services coordinated. A few participants suggested that  		the two hypothetical patients must have had help in the past and that the  		previous caregivers might be able to assist the patients after discharge. </p>
<p> With regard to the two patient vignettes, participants at five agencies  		discussed the difficulties involved in having family members perform caregiving  		duties. For example, Mrs. Smith's daughter lives out of state and therefore is  		unavailable to assist her mother. Mr. Lucas' daughter is a single mother  		raising three pre-teen boys and cannot afford to cut back on her work hours. In  		both cases, participants recommended that other people (e.g., other family  		members, neighbors, fellow church members) or alternative community services be  		identified. To further ease the burden on caregivers, participants suggested  		that social workers or caregiver support groups might be of help. Some  		participants noted that the patients may need to live with their families if  		other resources are not available, a proposition that may or may not be  		acceptable to the patients, caregivers, and other family members.</p>
<p> Participants at six agencies suggested that it is important to educate  		the caregiver about a patient's condition and care plan. They felt that the  		caregiver should know the signs and symptoms associated with the patient's  		disease, how to manage medications, and what to do in case of an emergency.  		Participants emphasized the importance of assessing the caregiver's ability and  		willingness to learn about the patient's condition and needs.</p>
<h4>2. Actors</h4>
<p> The focus group interviews elicited information about the influence  		exerted by different "actors" involved in the process of making decisions about  		recertification and discharge. Important actors include the patient's primary  		nurse, physician, the patient himself or herself, caregivers, the agency's FI,  		and payers (Medicaid, private insurance companies, managed Medicare  		contractors). </p>
<p> The focus group participants indicated that all decisions are made  		following the guidelines of Medicare and the FI. The primary decision makers  		are the physicians and home health nurses. Often, there is extensive dialogue  		between the physician ordering home health services and the nurse making the  		home visits. Participants suggested that home health nurses have less influence  		in decisions regarding recertification and discharge than they once did. Now,  		the physician makes the final decisions about a patient's care. The nurse's  		role in this process is to inform the physician about the patient's home  		situation. Participants indicated that they report information to the patient's  		physician about patient noncompliance with medications, cognitive impairments  		of caregivers, and medical instability. The physician often is unaware of these  		circumstances unless informed by the home health nurse.</p>
<p> Some focus group participants reported that there is agency-wide fear  		of Medicare review. One participant stated that "there is almost a sense of  		paranoia dealing with Medicare now." Participants perceived a very low  		tolerance for mistakes and a lack of trust between Medicare and home health  		nurses. One nurse suggested that "it just seems so wrong that something done in  		such good faith is investigated so closely." Some participants suggested that  		fear of Medicare review has resulted in patients being discharged more readily  		than they once were.</p>
<p> The patient's influence over and involvement in the decision to  		recertify or discharge varies. Most of the participants reported that they make  		recommendations to patients based on the patients' expectations and the  		guidelines of Medicare home health coverage. Communication with a patient about  		eventual discharge occurs early in the home health episode and helps the nurse  		plan alternative resources as well as education for the patient and/or  		caregiver. Some patients attempt to influence the decisions their nurses make  		in the hopes of lengthening their episodes of care.</p>
<h4>3. Agency Factors</h4>
<p> Focus group participants reported that there are no agency rules  		specific to recertification or discharge. However, participants at each of the  		focus groups reported that their agencies have developed processes through  		which recertification and discharge decisions are overseen. To promote  		adherence to Medicare coverage rules, agencies have the unwritten expectation  		that nurses will work with a clinical supervisor and/or through a case  		conference model (often multidisciplinary) as they make  		recertification/discharge decisions. Agencies generally support the decisions  		of the primary nurse provided that he or she is able to demonstrate a patient's  		need for services through this process. For example, participants at one of the  		focus groups indicated that their agency's policy is for recertification and  		discharge decisions to be made based on case conferences and discussions  		between the primary nurse and the nursing supervisor. It is expected that the  		supervisor will provide feedback on what services are appropriate based on the  		patient's needs and Medicare coverage rules.</p>
<h4>4. External Factors</h4>
<p> Several external factors were identified as influential in the  		decision-making process: (a) the IPS, (b) managed care, (c) the ORT, and (d)  		other factors affecting agency case mix.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Interim Payment System (IPS)</strong></i>: Although IPS is  		an external factor known to influence agencies' practice patterns, focus group  		participants from only one agency specifically referred to IPS. Since the focus  		group participants were nurses providing direct patient care (not clinical  		supervisors or managers), they might not have in-depth information about IPS  		and its implications. Although agency expectations and policies may be  		influenced by IPS, care providers are not exposed to the direct cause/effect  		relationship. It is not clear from the focus group data how many of the eight  		groups of participants had been informed about IPS. At best, the participants  		had been provided with information through newsletters, inservices, and/or  		informational meetings. </p>
<p> Despite the lack of direct mention of IPS, several issues likely to be  		associated with IPS were identified in the focus group data: reduction of  		patient services, documentation and nurse productivity, and refusal of  		patients. Some focus group participants indicated that the services they are  		able to provide to their patients have been reduced. Participants at one agency  		specifically referred to the impact of IPS and the forthcoming PPS. These  		participants reported that they are unable to offer as many services to their  		patients as they once did. This is partly because they have been encouraged to  		"get in and get out" of the home quickly and keep the number of visits low. As  		one participant explained, the patient can only have so many visits "because  		there are only so many dollars." Another group of participants noted that their  		agency has limited social work visits to two per patient.</p>
<p> Focus group participants frequently reported an increase in the burden  		of and changes in the means of documenting patient care. For some agencies,  		paperwork has doubled. At one agency, nurses reported that they must complete  		25 pages of documentation for an admission visit. Another agency has  		transitioned to computer documentation as a result of IPS. Nurses from two  		other agencies discussed the increase in paperwork, but did not specifically  		link these circumstances to IPS. Participants at three agencies indicated that  		additional paperwork, including collection of OASIS data (which is not a  		provision of IPS), have led to a reduction in time spent with patients. </p>
<p> Focus group participants from one agency reported that they are taking  		more work home with them at the end of their long workdays. As expressed by one  		participant, "we're stretched out." Participants at a different agency  		predicted that the amount of face-to-face contact with patients would continue  		to diminish. Productivity, as well as time spent with patients, is affected  		primarily by nurses spending more time doing paperwork, assuming clerical or  		support duties, tracking and obtaining supplies, and contacting physicians and  		others to obtain authorization for care and coordination of services.</p>
<p> Nurses from one agency linked IPS to the refusal of patients. These  		nurses reported that they complete forms every month to estimate the number of  		visits that will be needed for a patient. "High-need" patients sometimes are  		turned away because the services needed for these patients exceed the  		per-beneficiary or per-visit cost limits.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Managed Care</strong></i>: Nurses at five of the eight  		agencies indicated that managed care was an external factor affecting decision  		making. Participants reported that they care for more managed care (including  		Medicare managed care) and insurance patients than they did five years ago. The  		nurses expressed a general belief that managed care companies want participants  		to discontinue home care services as quickly as possible.</p>
<p> Participants reported spending considerably more time than they once  		did obtaining required authorization from managed care companies. The focus  		group participants reported that obtaining approval for visits and/or services  		was the major focus of all contacts with managed care companies. In addition,  		participants in all of the focus groups reported having experienced difficulty  		contacting managed care case managers to discuss patient care needs and  		decisions. Some nurses noted that authorization decisions vary depending on the  		particular case manager contacted. Some are lenient, whereas others require  		extensive justification for patient services. Nurses' workload is further  		increased because contacting managed care case managers often necessitates  		additional calls to physicians.</p>
<p> Although some of the focus group participants feel that they generally  		have control over the decision-making process, they do not believe they have  		autonomy in making decisions about their managed care patients. The primary  		nurse, physician, and other agency personnel can make recommendations about  		patients' care plans. However, the managed care company has the final say about  		the services to be provided. Nurses at one agency noted that even physicians  		can be overruled by the managed care company. One participant lamented, "our  		hands are tied." </p>
<p> Some of the focus group participants commented on the restrictions that  		managed care places on home care providers. One participant was familiar with a  		managed care organization that does not approve any medical social work visits,  		even for Medicare managed care patients. Another participant noted that a  		particular managed care company was known to approve more visits for patients  		who have been recently hospitalized, regardless of their diagnoses or symptoms.  		One nurse commented that "with Medicare HMOs, it's very limited what can be  		provided and length of services."</p>
<p> The focus group participants emphasized that managed care has forced  		nurses to teach patients and families more information in a shorter period of  		time. Many reported that managed care companies do not allow the duration of  		home care services necessary for instruction to be completed, especially in the  		case of patients with complicated care needs. Some focus group participants  		equated this situation with elder abuse. "Insurance companies are on our back  		about 'Why can't you teach them to do it. How come they can't learn? What's  		wrong?' We're trying to teach 85 year old spouses how to administer  		[intravenous] drugs with dangerous side effects."</p>
<p> Additionally, the focus group participants expressed suspicion and  		mistrust of managed care companies. One participant reported knowledge of a  		case worker at a managed care company who received a bonus for cutting back on  		patient visits. Another participant stated that managed care is "unsafe, I  		don't feel good about it. It's affecting our seniors." </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Operation Restore Trust (ORT)</strong></i>: Participants at  		two of the focus groups specifically referred to the anti-fraud initiative,  		ORT. At one agency, participants suggested that all agencies, not just those  		that have submitted fraudulent claims, are being monitored as part of ORT.  		However, participants at this agency reported that they do not worry about ORT.  		These nurses suggested that ORT does not influence the decisions they make  		about their patients' care. In their view, they simply provide patients with  		the care that they need. "There is no fraud here," was a typical respondent  		comment. </p>
<p> At the other agency, a participant had been told that home care was  		being regulated because agencies tried to maximize visits. Participants felt  		strongly about this issue, noting that "we're suffering so much from agencies  		that were charging fraudulently. There were rumors about the FBI sending nurses  		and physicians to jail. There are so many things you can do for people, but  		because we're suffering for those who were fraudulent, we can't do it."</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Other Factors Affecting Agency Case Mix</strong></i>: Focus  		group participants noted that patients are coming out of the hospital sicker  		than they once did. The first visit for these patients can be especially long  		and difficult. These complex patients require a great deal of attention and  		often require high-technology care, such as infusion therapy, parenteral  		nutrition, and ventilator care. The focus group participants noted that many  		home care nurses do not have the skills needed to care for these patients, nor  		are they able to manage the productivity and documentation requirements  		associated with these complex cases. At one agency, the change in case mix is  		reflected as a larger caseload of Medicaid and Medicare managed care patients.  		Although the nurses felt that this change promoted their autonomy in decision  		making, it also necessitated more responsibility, more paperwork, and more  		contact with physicians. There was agreement that this added stress is a factor  		in decision making. </p>
<h4>5. Medicare Coverage Rules</h4>
<p> Focus group participants at each of the eight agencies discussed the  		influence of Medicare coverage rules on decisions regarding recertification and  		discharge. Several factors associated with Medicare coverage rules emerged as  		important themes in the focus group data: (a) homebound status, (b) skilled  		nursing services, (c) management and evaluation (M&amp;E), (d) ambiguity of  		coverage rules, (e) documentation, and (f) effect on patient care.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Homebound Status</strong></i>: The results of the focus  		group interviews indicate that, although a patient's homebound status is  		critical to the decision to recertify or discharge, the definition of  		"homebound" is ambiguous and subjective. Nurses agreed that they would need the  		following information to make a determination about a patient's homebound  		status: how often and why the patient leaves the home, the degree of difficulty  		the patient has in getting to the car, who drives the patient, and how long it  		takes the patient to recover from a trip. </p>
<p> However, the definition of "homebound" differed substantially among  		nurses. Some participants interpret homebound to mean that a patient cannot  		leave his or her home under any circumstances. Other nurses reported that a  		homebound patient is one who is able to leave the home only with taxing effort.  		One participant suggested that, to be considered homebound, a patient could not  		leave the home for socialization or shopping, but that attendance at church,  		doctor's visits, and appointments with the hairdresser were acceptable. This  		nurse stated that a patient does not "have to be stretched out in bed to be  		considered homebound." Participants agreed that patients who are able to drive  		are not homebound, even if there are medical contraindications, the patient's  		disease process is uncontrolled, or there are influencing psychosocial factors.  		The nurses indicated that patients who can drive would be discharged,  		regardless of such factors. Note that, according to Medicare coverage rules,  		the ability to drive is not a definitive indication that a patient is not  		homebound.</p>
<p> When discussing Mrs. Smith's case, most participants stated that her  		visit to the hairdresser does not disqualify her from being considered  		homebound. One participant, however, said that she would discharge Mrs. Smith  		because her trip to the hairdresser indicates that her CHF is under control and  		that she should be considered stable and no longer in need of skilled  		services.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Skilled Nursing Services</strong></i>: The need for skilled  		nursing services is the determining factor in the decision-making process. If a  		patient does not meet skilled care criteria, he or she is not eligible for  		Medicare coverage. Some nurses noted that physicians are not always clear about  		what constitutes a need for skilled nursing care. The participants in one focus  		group reported that physicians sometimes refer patients for home care who do  		not have a skilled need. At times, this agency has tried to find some type of  		skilled service need in order to retain the physician's continued referral.  		Nurses did point out that patients with unskilled needs had the option of  		paying for private services. Further, two of the study states have state waiver  		programs to which patients needing only unskilled services are referred.</p>
<p> In examining Mrs. Smith's case, participants discussed the possibility  		of pre-pouring her medication. However, according to Medicare coverage rules,  		pre-pouring of medications is not a skilled service. Without a skilled need,  		Mrs. Smith cannot be recertified. In examining Mr. Lucas' case, one participant  		stated that she would not have admitted Mr. Lucas. She did not believe he had a  		need for skilled care to begin with. However, other participants suggested that  		he might qualify for skilled services. There were different points of view  		about whether his wound care should be considered a skilled service. Some noted  		that if the wound was healed, Medicare would not allow continued home care and  		the patient would have to be discharged. If Mr. Lucas could not self-administer  		insulin because of neuropathy or blindness, Medicare would cover such visits.  		It was noted that Mr. Lucas may have social issues as well, but that social  		issues are not indicative of a need for skilled services. </p>
<p> Participants expressed concern that families in situations similar to  		Mrs. Smith's or Mr. Lucas' tend to expect that aide services will continue even  		after nursing care is no longer needed. In such cases, care providers must  		explain that Medicare will not cover continued aide services when a patient no  		longer requires skilled nursing care.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Management and Evaluation (M&amp;E)</strong></i>: Skilled  		nursing visits for M&amp;E of a patient's care plan are covered by Medicare in  		cases in which only an RN can assure the complex and necessary care that an  		unstable patient receives from nonskilled caregivers is successfully  		maintaining the patient's medical condition. The focus group data suggest that  		nurses are uncertain what the M&amp;E treatment code is and when it can be  		used. M&amp;E arose as a topic of discussion at six of the eight focus groups.  		Five of the eight agencies participating in the focus group interviews do not  		use M&amp;E. Nurses at one additional agency reported that they had been told  		not to use the M&amp;E treatment code, although it had been used at their  		agency in the past. Nurses' explanations of M&amp;E were strikingly different  		across these six agencies.</p>
<p> Nurses at an agency at which M&amp;E never has been used explained that  		this treatment code applies to complex patients, especially those who are  		forgetful. These nurses believed that M&amp;E also could involve managing a  		patient's medications, especially if a caregiver is responsible for medication  		management. The participants from this agency emphasized that the nurse must  		make sure that caregivers are appropriately caring for the patient. According  		to these participants, M&amp;E requires detailed documentation and requires the  		nurse to visit the patient monthly. Home health aides can be ordered more  		frequently. </p>
<p> Nurses from a different agency reported that Medicare no longer covers  		M&amp;E. "It can't be done." One participant explained that this was true  		because M&amp;E was linked to intravenous (IV) therapy and venipuncture, in  		particular monthly protimes. However, she expected that M&amp;E could apply to  		a patient with a central (IV) line if the family was unable to manage it  		appropriately.</p>
<p> When examining the hypothetical patient scenarios presented to them,  		participants from three agencies suggested that M&amp;E would not apply to Mr.  		Lucas' case or similar cases. There was disagreement as to the appropriateness  		of M&amp;E with respect to Mrs. Smith's case. Nurses from one agency felt  		M&amp;E could apply to her situation. They described M&amp;E as the ability to  		recertify a patient for the purpose of long-term planning and establishing care  		plans for complex patients. They suggested that the following needs could be  		listed as skilled services to justify coverage: observation, assessment, and  		management of caregivers. Nurses from another agency indicated that M&amp;E  		would not apply to Mrs. Smith. Their interpretation was that a patient had to  		have complex needs, have multiple caregivers, and need a large number of hours  		for the necessary care. Apparently, Mrs. Smith did not qualify under their  		definition. Another group of participants did not think their agency had a  		specific policy for situations such as Mrs. Smith's. However, they were certain  		that M&amp;E required specific training of nurses and that M&amp;E is one of  		the "four skilled services" in home care. It requires different criteria for  		documentation and is used for short-term periods while community resources are  		located for a patient.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Ambiguity</strong></i>: Participants in three of the focus  		groups referred to the ambiguity of Medicare coverage rules. One agency's  		participants noted that it was difficult to understand the HIM-11 (the Medicare  		manual on home health). One participant stated that she does not "understand  		[the HIM-11], it's kind of vague. You have to be a lawyer because it's  		difficult to understand." Nurses at another agency noticed differing  		interpretations of the coverage rules when their agency had a change in FI.  		These nurses reported a sense of not knowing the rules until they get  		broken.</p>
<p> Discussion of Mr. Lucas' case at one agency revealed one participant's  		misinformation concerning the coverage rules. She believed that to justify a  		patient's need for B12 injections, she would have to document the patient's  		need for monthly venipuncture. She was unaware that venipuncture is no longer a  		qualifying service for Medicare home health care. This participant and others  		believed that the venipuncture regulations applied only to venipuncture for lab  		work to measure prothrombin time ("protime"). As discussed previously, the  		confusion surrounding venipuncture may contribute to nurses misunderstanding of  		the M&amp;E treatment code.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Documentation</strong></i>: Documentation is the key to  		justification of services and must support the need for skilled nursing care.  		It must be specific and concrete. Participants made it clear that there has  		been an increase in the amount of paperwork in home care, including more forms  		to complete and more repetitive documentation. Some nurses expressed a sense of  		paranoia based on the documentation requirements that every "i" must be dotted  		and every "t" crossed. Others believed that documentation should not cause  		added worry so long as patients are given the care they need. If agencies are  		not submitting fraudulent claims and nurses provide the needed care, the  		documentation (485s and 488s) should speak for itself. </p>
<p> Participants reported that omissions or a lack of clarity in  		documentation have led to denials of recertification. Nurses reported that the  		FIs ask for more records than they once did, which has resulted in an increased  		need for staff education on coverage rules and appropriate documentation. One  		participant observed that nurses may fail to document teaching as a skilled  		service. As a result, agencies may receive requests for additional  		documentation, each of which requires the completion of the 488 form in  		response. </p>
<p> Among the focus group participants, there was support for the 485 as  		the best form for standardization. Together, the 485 and 488 are adequate for  		substantiating care needs. Participants at one agency reported that there are  		certain terms that their FI does not like to see in the 485s (e.g., "monitor,"  		"stable"). However, they indicated that their documentation is not determined  		by what they think Medicare or the FI wants. Documentation should explain the  		activities of the care provider. As one participant put it, "you want to paint  		a picture so that when they ask for the records everything is clear. They can  		look at your documentation and tell exactly what is going on and if there is a  		need." </p>
<p> When discussing documentation, participants also identified the  		following vignette-specific information that they would include in their  		reports to justify skilled care:</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><strong>Mrs. Smith (CHF)</strong>
<ul><li>Fluid/weight gain and other active signs and symptoms of  				  CHF</li>

</div>
<p>	<i><strong>Effect on Patient Care</strong></i>: Participants noted that  		federal regulations are always a factor in decision making in home health care.  		They worry that coverage rules have shifted the focus of care from the patient  		to money. Participants discussed the effect that coverage rules have had on  		patient care. Nurses expressed the general belief that non-medical people are  		setting guidelines for home health care, not truly understanding how their  		decisions impact the quantity and quality of the services provided. One  		agency's nurses felt that the changes in coverage rules have affected what  		services agencies can provide and patients can receive. For example, a patient  		may need more education "than the guidelines dictate." The nurses suggested  		that Medicare wants patient and family education to be achieved in a shorter  		period of time in an effort to discharge patients sooner. The participants felt  		that Medicare policy-makers do not have a realistic view of the patient  		education process.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVB" id="chapVB">B. Case Study Interviews</a></h3>
<p> The case study interviews were designed primarily to examine the  		practice of home health care. In this chapter, the qualitative information  		gathered during the case study interviews is used to describe the care provided  		during seven episodes of care. Specifically, information is summarized  		concerning the following aspects of care: (1) key characteristics of the  		episodes of care (e.g., length, disciplines involved), (2) services provided by  		home care personnel and the family support system, (3) care planning and  		coordination (e.g., development and documentation of the care plan), and (4)  		content of the skilled nursing visit (e.g., assessment, teaching). The small  		sample of nurses involved in the case study interviews made it difficult to  		identify differences between agencies in different state volume, agency  		ownership, and agency type groups. However, nurses' responses with regard to  		certain aspects of home care did appear to differ depending on volume,  		ownership, and type. These differences are described when appropriate.</p>
<h4>1. Key Characteristics of the Episodes of Care</h4>
<p> In order to examine factors that may be related to variations in  		lengths of stay in the Medicare home health benefit, patients with either long  		or short episodes of care were identified. The seven patients whose care was  		examined during the case study interviews were on service with their home  		health agencies an average of 102.3 days, with a range of 19 to 441. However,  		because two patients had very lengthy stays, the median number of days on  		service across the seven patients was much smaller (26.0 days). Because of the  		presence of these two outliers, median rather than mean values will be used  		throughout this chapter to describe the services provided in home health  		care.</p>
<p><a href="#table5.1"> Table 5.1</a> presents length of stay, number of  		disciplines, number of skilled nursing visits, and total number of visits for  		the case study patients by state volume group, agency ownership, and agency  		type. The small sample size for the case study limits our ability to draw  		conclusions based on these data. Therefore, information regarding the key  		characteristics of the case study episodes of care is presented for descriptive  		purposes only. Because we attempted to identify long-stay patients in the  		high-volume states and short-stay patients in the low-volume states, the  		differences in length of stay and the number of visits between the patients  		treated in the two state groups is not surprising.</p>

</tr></table><p> Lengths of stay for the case study patients appeared to be somewhat  		related to agency ownership and type. Case study patients on service with  		proprietary agencies tended to have longer lengths of stay than did patients on  		service with non-proprietary agencies (44.5 versus 26.0 days). Patients of  		freestanding home health agencies tended to be on service slightly longer than  		did patients of hospital-based agencies (39.5 versus 31.0 days). </p>
<p> Agencies typically involved two disciplines in the care of each  		patient. The actual number of disciplines involved ranged from one to four. The  		disciplines involved in treating the seven case study patients were the  		following: skilled nursing (seven patients), physical therapy (PT) (three  		patients), home health aide (two patients), social work (one patient), and  		occupational therapy (OT) (one patient). Nurses from two of the case study  		agencies mentioned that they would have involved PT, but they felt that their  		patients were too weak to receive benefit from these services. In one of these  		cases, the nurse also believed the patient to be unmotivated to engage in PT.  		Agencies in the different state volume, agency ownership, and agency type  		groups did not appear to differ in their involvement of different home care  		disciplines.</p>
<p> The services of some disciplines were offered by home care agencies,  		but refused by the patients. In fact, five of the seven case study patients  		refused a recommended service. Two patients refused to accept the services of a  		social worker, and three others refused to accept the services of a home health  		aide. <a href="#table5.2">Table 5.2</a> provides service utilization  		information for each of the seven case study patients.</p>

</tr></table><p> The case study nurses were asked whether there were any services they  		would have liked to provide for their patients, but that were not available.  		None of the nurses indicated there were services that they were unable to  		provide for the case study patients. However, speaking in general terms, two  		nurses reported that they frequently are unable to obtain certain services for  		their patients. One nurse remarked that respite care is a chronic need in home  		care. Suggesting that "one sick person can kill ten healthy people," this nurse  		commented that respite care is of critical importance because "if we don't take  		care of [the caregivers], they are going to end up costing us more money in the  		long run.... The caregivers give out, especially a spouse that is the same  		age." A second nurse commented on the lack of community resources in her  		county. In the rural Southern town where this nurse's agency is located, no  		senior activity centers, community or public transportation systems, or  		volunteer programs are available to help elderly patients. The agency itself is  		currently working to set up a volunteer program in the community to meet some  		of these needs.</p>
<p> The findings regarding the number of skilled nursing visits mirror  		those regarding episode length. Patients received a median of ten skilled  		nursing visits during the course of their home care episodes. The actual number  		of such visits varied drastically across patients, with a range from four to  		150. Patients of proprietary agencies received a slightly larger median number  		of skilled nursing visits than did patients of non-proprietary agencies (11.5  		versus 9.0). Freestanding agencies provided slightly more frequent skilled  		nursing visits for their patients than did hospital-based agencies (11.5 versus  		9.0). </p>
<p> The median total number of visits (across disciplines) that the case  		study patients received was 22.0, with a range from five to 151. The total  		number of visits across disciplines differed only slightly by agency ownership  		and type. Non-proprietary agencies provided slightly more visits than  		proprietary agencies (22.0 versus 20.0), and hospital-based agencies provided  		slightly more visits than freestanding agencies (22.0 versus 20.0). </p>
<h4>2. Services Provided in Home Health Care</h4>
<p> Five disciplines were involved in the care of the seven case study  		patients. Each discipline provided a unique set of services to these patients.  		The services provided by skilled nursing staff, physical therapists,  		occupational therapists, medical social workers, home health aides, and the  		family support system are summarized in this section.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Skilled Nursing</strong></i>: Home care nurses provide a  		variety of services to their patients (see <a href="#table5.3">Table 5.3</a>).  		Assessment represents one of the nurses' major activities. In five of the seven  		cases, the primary nurses admitted the patients, conducting the initial  		assessments of their needs (in two cases, patients were admitted by an  		admission nurse and the on-call nurse, respectively). In the initial  		assessments, the patients' conditions, needs, and eligibility for services were  		examined as well as the patients' social and home environment. These  		assessments provide a basis for the development of the care plan. </p>

</tr></table><p> Throughout the episodes of care, the nurses continued to assess their  		patients. These assessments comprised a major component of each visit. Indeed,  		three nurses indicated that assessment was one of the most time-consuming  		activities they engage in during their visits. In coordination with the nurses'  		regular assessments of the patients, nurses managed their patients'  		medications. They identified medication side effects, set up pill boxes to  		enhance the patients' ability to take medications correctly, and at some visits  		drew lab work to assess the appropriateness of medication doses. </p>
<p> The case study nurses indicated that education was one of their most  		time-consuming and important activities. All of the nurses noted that the focus  		of home care activities has increasingly turned from the direct provision of  		services by medical personnel to teaching patients and their families how to  		provide those services for themselves. According to three case study nurses,  		home care providers "are being told to get in and get out" of their patients'  		homes as quickly as possible. To shorten their patients' duration in home care,  		the nurses reported the need to educate patients to the point that they are  		capable of caring for themselves independently. Nurses educated patients about  		the signs and symptoms of their medical conditions, their medication regimens  		(e.g., purposes, doses, side effects, use of a pill box), their diets, home  		safety, use of medical equipment, use of weight or diabetic diaries, and  		changes in condition that would require medical attention.</p>
<p> Four of the nurses commented that it can be a struggle to teach elderly  		patients the information they need to know to care for themselves. In two  		cases, the patients had great difficulty understanding and remembering the  		details of their medication regimens. In one of these cases, the patient was  		never able to understand his medication regimen, whereas in the other case, the  		patient learned very slowly. The nurse in this latter case commented that, in  		her agency, the nurses "are told to try to get in and get out, but that's not  		always possible because people learn at different paces." In another case, the  		nurse reported that her patient was simply not receptive to learning about his  		medical condition.</p>
<p> The nurses engaged in a number of other activities on their patients'  		behalf. Three of the nurses indicated that one of their most time-consuming  		activities in caring for their patients was coordinating care among various  		care providers. According to one nurse, "orchestrating, organizing, making sure  		everyone was on the same page" was a major component of the work she performed  		while caring for her patient. Four nurses commented that the completion of  		mandated forms and the documentation of their care plans comprised a major  		component of their workload with regard to the case study patients. Two nurses  		indicated that they spent a major portion of their time just talking to the  		patients, building rapport, and trying to identify the patients' needs and  		concerns. In addition, as mentioned above, one nurse emphasized the importance  		of the psychological services that primary nurses often provide. Another nurse  		suggested that helping the patient to establish a network of friends and family  		members to assist him was an important part of her work with this patient.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Physical and Occupational Therapy</strong></i>: Three of the  		case study patients received PT during the course of their home health care  		episodes. In all cases, PT was ordered because the patients were weak or  		unsteady on their feet. In one case, the physical therapist conducted an  		evaluation only, concluding that the patient did not actually require PT. In  		the other two cases, physical therapists worked with patients on their balance  		as well as their walking and stair-climbing abilities. </p>
<p> OT was involved in the care of only one of the case study patients. In  		this case, OT was ordered by the patient's physician. However, at the time of  		the initial OT evaluation, the occupational therapist determined that the  		patient was not in need of these services.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Medical Social Work</strong></i>: Three of the seven case  		study nurses believed that their patients needed the services of a social  		worker. In two cases, the nurses hoped a social worker could identify resources  		outside of the home health agency. In one case, the patient, whose elderly wife  		was having trouble driving, was in need of transportation to and from medical  		appointments. In the other case, the patient was being evicted from her home  		and needed assistance finding new housing for herself and her  		developmentally-impaired son and daughter-in-law. In the third case, a social  		worker was recommended because the primary nurse believed the patient needed  		psychological help to address her anxiety and fear that she was incapable of  		caring for her terminally ill significant other.</p>
<p> Although a social worker was recommended to three patients, only one  		patient accepted such services. A social worker completed a single visit with  		the patient in need of new housing. She then contacted a state caseworker that  		arranged for new housing and state-run nursing services for this patient. In  		the other two cases, the patients refused social work services, "as patients  		often do." These refusals put the nurses in the position of having to provide  		services that ideally would be provided by another discipline. The nurse caring  		for the patient who was experiencing anxiety over her ability to care for her  		terminally ill significant other had to take on the role of a social worker,  		both helping the patient and her family to identify outside resources (e.g.,  		hospice care), and providing psychological counseling. Although immersed in the  		role of counselor more so in this situation than she normally would be, this  		nurse commented that psychological counseling is not an uncommon activity for  		primary nursing staff. Indeed, it is "one of the most important things [nurses]  		do in home health care. The head and the body are not disconnected."</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Home Health Aide</strong></i>: Five of the seven case study  		nurses recommended home health aide services to their patients. In two cases,  		home health aides assisted patients two or three times a week with a variety of  		activities including showering, skin care, meal preparation, bedroom and  		bathroom cleaning, laundry, and shopping. Aides also have responsibilities  		associated with the assessment of the patients. For example, the aides in one  		of these cases weighed the patient and reminded her to take her medications.  		Further, aides report any changes in a patient's condition immediately to the  		primary nurse. In this way, they serve as another set of eyes for the nursing  		staff.</p>
<p> As with the services of a social worker, the case study patients often  		refused home health aide services. In three of the five cases in which aides  		were recommended, the patients refused to accept these services. In two of  		these cases, aide services were refused because the patients' family members  		were able and committed to helping the patients with these activities. The  		third patient did not have such family assistance, but still would not accept  		help from an aide. Some patients may be uncomfortable having a stranger help  		them with the very personal activities in which aides are often involved (e.g.,  		bathing assistance).</p>
<p> The case study nurses often indicated that those patients who do accept  		home health aide services greatly appreciate these services. One nurse noted  		that the patients "love [the aides], they become part of their families."  		Indeed, patients often become overly dependent on the aides who care for them.  		In both cases in which patients received aide services, the patients did not  		want to discontinue these services. One nurse commented on the need to "wean"  		patients from aide services. In this case, the nurse initially provided the  		patient with the minimum number of weekly aide visits she thought the patient  		might need. She commented that it was easier to increase than to reduce the  		number of weekly visits provided. In addition, the nurse progressively cut back  		on the services the aides provided. Although the aides continued to see the  		patient with equal frequency throughout the episode of care, they performed  		fewer and fewer services at each visit. Near the end of the episode of care,  		the aides were in the house primarily to provide a sense of comfort and  		security to the patient as she became increasingly capable of caring for her  		own needs. This same nurse noted that, more recently, she has begun to reduce  		not only the services provided by the aides across the episode of care, but the  		number of weekly visits as well.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Family Support System</strong></i>: The family support  		system is of critical importance to home health care patients. Each of the case  		study patients had at least one family member who assisted them. Four patients  		relied on two or more family members on a regular basis. Five of the patients  		received a great deal of assistance from their family support systems. The  		other two patients had a single involved family member who provided minimal  		assistance. In both of these cases, the family member involved was elderly. In  		one case, the patient's brother ran some errands for him. In the other, the  		patient's wife, who drove the patient to the doctor and did some cleaning  		around the house, was quite ill herself with a cardiac condition. Her ability  		to assist the patient was quite limited. Among the five patients with highly  		involved family support systems, the patients' wives were the main caregivers  		in two cases and the patients' children were the main caregivers in three  		cases. In one case, the patient's son and daughter-in-law, who were both  		cognitively impaired, struggled to help the patient check her blood sugar and  		to understand and follow the medication regimen.</p>
<p> Family members of the case study patients provided assistance with  		ADLs, IADLs, environmental support, and psychosocial support. In addition,  		family members were quite active in the patients' home care.  		<a href="#table5.4">Table 5.4</a> identifies the activities that family members  		performed for patients. Family members were somewhat active in assisting  		patients with their ADLs. Of the case study patients, three received help in  		bathing and personal care from the members of their families. In one other  		family, the patient was assisted by her son and daughter-in-law in grooming,  		transferring, and feeding. Families were frequently involved in patients'  		IADLs. Five of the seven families took an active role in helping the patients  		manage their medications. Family members picked up patients' medications,  		learned about medication side effects and schedules, set up pillboxes with the  		patients' daily doses of medications, and reminded patients to take their  		medications.</p>
<p> For elderly patients for whom managing varying schedules for multiple  		medications can be a real challenge, the assistance of family members in the  		management of medications was invaluable. Four patients relied on family  		members for transportation, and three patients had family assistance with meal  		preparation. Members of two families took on housekeeping and shopping  		responsibilities. Family members assisted one patient in doing the laundry.</p>

</tr></table><p> Family members took an active role in the patients' home care  		activities as well. In all but one of the seven cases, family members were  		present at most or all of the skilled nursing visits. Family members often were  		involved in the development of the patients' care plans. In some cases, family  		members even requested and refused services for the patients. One nurse  		commented that the family of her patient was less involved in determining the  		care plan than it otherwise might have been because the patient herself was  		alert and capable of making decisions on her own.</p>
<p> Family members participated in the patients' care in several additional  		ways. Family members of two patients weighed the patients every day, recording  		these measurements in a weight log. These individuals had been educated about  		the importance of weight changes, and instructed as to when they should contact  		the patients' physicians in response to a weight change. One patient had family  		assistance in conducting and recording the results of her regular blood sugar  		tests. The wife of one patient was responsible for learning how to use her  		husband's IV pump, setting up and turning on/off her husband's IV medication,  		and caring for his central line.</p>
<p> Clearly, family members provide substantial assistance to elderly home  		care patients. The nurses for some of the case study patients indicated that  		certain services (e.g., transportation, aide services) were unnecessary for  		their patients because the family support system was so strong. Indeed, in two  		of the three cases in which patients refused the services of a home health  		aide, they did so specifically because they had family members who were willing  		and able to take over those functions. Nurses often commented that their  		educational activities are targeted at family members as well as the patients.  		In some cases, the patients were so weak at the beginning of their episodes of  		care that the families were the primary targets of initial education  		activities, until the patients became stronger and more capable of involvement  		in their own medical care. One nurse commented that elderly home care patients  		are "just out of luck unless they have family to help them."</p>
<h4>3. Care Planning and Coordination</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Development of the Care Plan</strong></i>: The original  		referral from a patient's physician marks the starting point for the provision  		of home health care. The referrals for the seven case study patients varied in  		content and specificity. In four of the seven cases, the physicians ordered  		skilled nursing care only. In the remaining three cases, the physicians ordered  		visits by multiple disciplines including PT (three cases), aide services (two  		cases), and OT (one case). Rarely did physicians specify the frequency or  		duration of visits. In only two of the seven cases did the referring physicians  		indicate the frequency with which visits should occur. None of the physicians  		indicated an expected duration for the home care episode.</p>
<p> After the original referrals were received by the home care agencies,  		agency nurses completed their initial assessments of the condition and needs of  		the case study patients. For the three patients whose physicians had ordered PT  		and/or OT, the initial PT and/or OT assessments were conducted at this time.  		During the course of their evaluations of the case study patients, the nurses  		and therapists developed recommendations as to the appropriate care plans. The  		nurses and therapists identified the patients' problems, worked with the  		patients to establish treatment goals with expected achievement dates, laid out  		education topics, and pinpointed other disciplines that might be needed. At  		this time, the nurses identified the expected duration of the episode of care  		and the frequency with which the skilled nursing and aide visits should occur.  		The therapists identified the expected frequency and duration of their  		services.</p>
<p> In three cases, the nurses indicated that it is the primary nurse who  		makes decisions about the patient's care plan. At two agencies, the primary  		nurse and supervisor both were involved in the development of the care plan. In  		one of these cases, the supervisor and the nurse met to establish the care  		plan. In the other case, the supervisor reviewed the care plan that the primary  		nurse developed independently. In this latter case, the approved care plan was  		then sent to the "chart review committee" at the agency's home office for final  		approval. In one case in which the primary nurse had not conducted the initial  		assessment with the patient, the primary and admission nurses met together to  		establish the care plan. In only two cases did nurses note the involvement of  		the physicians in the development of the care plan. In one case, the nurse  		reported that she generated the care plan, which was then approved (with no  		changes) by the physician. In the other case, the nurse stressed that her  		findings from the initial assessment simply provided information to the  		physician as he developed the patient's care plan.</p>
<p> The case study nurses also commented on the involvement of the patients  		and the family in care planning decisions. By virtue of the fact that patients  		must be motivated to achieve the goals laid out in the care plan, nurses work  		closely with the patients to identify appropriate goals and achievement dates.  		Patients and their family members also are involved in determining what  		services are provided and with what frequency. As previously described,  		patients and/or their families often refuse services that are recommended by  		the primary nurse. Patients also have to approve the frequency of visits that  		the care providers recommend. Sometimes, patients and their families request  		services that the nurses perceive to be unnecessary. In two cases, patients and  		their families wanted additional aide services, another patient and her family  		wanted to receive as many services as possible, and another patient did not  		want to discontinue home care.</p>
<p> Consistent with the Administrator Questionnaire findings described in  		<a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>, agencies in the different state volume and  		agency ownership groups appeared to differ somewhat in the actors involved in  		the development of a patient's care plan. Nurses in the low-volume states  		appear to have greater influence over the decision-making process than do  		nurses in high-volume states. Among the four nurses from agencies in low-volume  		states, three reported that the primary nurse was responsible for the  		development of the care plans, and the fourth reported that she generated care  		plan recommendations that were then approved by the physician. The nurses from  		the agencies in high-volume states reported having less control over their  		patients' care plans. Two of these three nurses reported that the care plans  		were developed in conjunction with or were approved by nursing supervisors. In  		one case, the care plan was approved by the chart review committee at the  		agency's home office as well. The third nurse from a high-volume state reported  		that the physician, not the nurse, created the care plan. </p>
<p> Supervisory staff appears to be more involved in the development of  		patient care plans in proprietary than non-proprietary agencies. Two of the  		four nurses from proprietary agencies reported that their supervisors and/or  		chart review committees were involved in the development or approval of the  		case study patients' care plans. None of the nurses from the non-proprietary  		agencies reported the involvement of such staff.</p>
<p> Although the physician's referral is the starting place for identifying  		what services a patient will receive, these original orders generally only  		provide a glimpse of what a patient's final care plan will include. As  		mentioned above, the physicians usually left decisions about the kind,  		frequency, and duration of care a patient should receive up to the home care  		nurses and therapists. Even when the physicians made suggestions regarding the  		kinds and frequency of services that should be provided, the nurses and  		therapists in six of these seven cases were allowed ample leeway to alter the  		plans laid out in the original referral.</p>
<p> Indeed, in all but one case, the services offered to the patients were  		different from those recommended in the original referral. One nurse commented  		that she does "not usually go by the original referral [as] the doctor ... may  		not know about the patient's other needs," having little knowledge of the  		patient's social and home environment. In several cases, patients were offered  		services that were not recommended in the physicians' original referrals.  		Although none of the physicians ordered the services of a social worker in  		their original referrals, home care nurses offered these services to three of  		the case study patients. Whereas physicians ordered aide services in two cases,  		three additional patients were offered these services by their home care  		nurses.</p>
<p> In other cases, patients were not offered all the services that the  		physicians had recommended. Two nurses reported that physicians sometimes write  		orders for services for which their patients are not eligible or that their  		patients do not need. Indeed, in two cases, physicians recommended services  		that agency personnel considered to be unnecessary. In one of the three cases  		in which a physician ordered PT for a patient, the physical therapist who  		evaluated the patient believed that there was no need for these services. In  		the only case in which a patient's physician ordered OT, the therapist assessed  		that the patient was not in need of such therapy. On a general note, one nurse  		reported that physicians "may automatically write down 'home health aide'" in  		their orders, even when their patients do not really need these services. In  		these situations, the nurses inform the physicians that the patients are not  		eligible for or do not need these services.</p>
<p> Nurses identified a number of factors that influenced their decisions  		and recommendations about the frequency with which skilled nursing services  		should be provided to the case study patients. Most commonly, nurses reported  		that the stability or instability of their patients' medical conditions was a  		factor considered in the decision-making process. Three nurses reported that  		they felt their patients, each of whom had just been discharged from the  		hospital, needed fairly frequent nursing visits (i.e., three times a week at  		the start of care) because their conditions were quite unstable. In another  		case, the nurse reported that she would have recommended more frequent visits  		than she did had the patient been more unstable.</p>
<p> The presence of a family support system also had an important impact on  		nurses' decisions about the frequency of care to provide. Two nurses  		specifically mentioned that they would have visited their patients more  		frequently if it were not for the availability of the patients' family members.  		Three nurses reported that a family member's ability to learn was a major  		influence on their decisions about the frequency with which skilled nursing  		visits should be provided. One nurse reported visiting the patient more  		frequently at the start of care than might have been necessary because the  		family was confused about the patient's medication regimen. Another nurse  		reported that her perception of the patient's ability to learn also contributed  		to her decisions about frequency. </p>
<p> Three nurses indicated that the activities they would need to perform  		at their skilled nursing visits helped them determine how frequently those  		visits should occur. In each case, the nurses suggested that they did not need  		to see their patients very frequently because their activities in the house  		would be restricted to assessment and teaching. If their patients required  		wound care or other hands-on treatment, the visits would have been more  		frequent.</p>
<p> Issues related to the patients' medications also were mentioned by  		nurses as factors considered in the decision-making process. One nurse visited  		the patient more frequently than she might have otherwise because he had  		recently been placed on a number of new medications. This new and more  		complicated medication regimen required the nurse to engage in immediate  		education of the patient and to watch the patient closely to evaluate the  		appropriateness of the doses and the presence of side effects. Another nurse  		timed her visits to occur on the three days each week that the patient's wife  		would administer the patient's IV medication. One nurse felt compelled to visit  		her patient more frequently because it was clear that he was not in compliance  		with his medication regimen.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Documentation of the Care Plan</strong></i>: Home care  		providers document their patients' care plans in a variety of ways. The two  		primary approaches to documenting patient care plans are to use nursing notes  		or care plan forms to record information about a patient's case. In four cases,  		the case study nurses indicated that their patients' care plans are documented  		in nursing notes, which are stored in the patients' charts. These notes  		document information about the patient's condition, care plan, and progress at  		each visit. Nurses from the other three agencies indicated that they use a  		specific form for documenting the care plan. At two agencies, this document --  		called the "Care Plan Form" and the "Nursing Treatment Plan," respectively --  		contains extensive information about the patient's medical condition, needs,  		treatment plan, goals, and prognosis as well as the orders for the patient. At  		one agency, the care plan documents also contain a checklist of activities that  		should be performed at each visit and a "plan of focus" for the next visit. The  		third agency that uses a specific form for documenting the care plan uses a  		"Problem List." This form is less detailed than the care plan documents at the  		other two agencies, containing only information about the patient's problems  		and short- and long-term goals. The form does not include any information about  		the interventions planned for the patient.</p>
<p> In addition to care plan documents and progress notes, the case study  		nurses reported additional ways in which the care plan for a patient is  		documented. Nurses from three agencies indicated that their comprehensive  		assessment tools (OASIS in two cases) represent a component of their  		documentation process. Two agencies use the orders for a patient as part of  		their documentation. A nurse from one of these agencies indicated that her  		agency no longer uses written care plan documents because all the needed  		information is contained in the orders. Discontinuing the use of a care plan  		form has cut down on repetitive documentation for the nursing staff. Two  		agencies use teaching guides as part of their care plans. These guides, copies  		of which are given to patients, also serve as a documented teaching plans for  		the nurses. One nurse indicated that her hospital-based agency has clinical  		pathways that often serve as documentation of the care plan for patients with  		specific conditions.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Communication Among Home Care Providers</strong></i>: One  		important aspect of home care is the coordination of the many care providers  		involved in patient care. The primary nurse is in regular contact with the  		patient's physician, aides, and therapists throughout the course of the episode  		of care. Nurses generally communicate with the patients' physicians at  		milestone time points in their patients' care. The nurses provide the  		physicians with the care plan following the start of care visit and inform the  		physicians of their intentions to discharge. All of the nurses indicated that  		they are in contact with the physicians when there are any changes to the  		patients' conditions or care plan. Two nurses reported that they contact  		physicians with information about patients' lab values. One additional nurse  		reported that she contacts the physician to clarify orders, to request an  		extension to the duration of care she had recommended in her original care  		plan, and to follow up after the patient's scheduled clinic visits.</p>
<p> Contact with the physician is nearly always indirect. With the  		exception of one nurse who met with her patient's physician at least once or  		twice a week, all of the nurses reported communicating with the physicians by  		leaving telephone messages with the doctors' nurses.<sup><font><a href="#note44">44</a></font></sup> One nurse commented that "you never get the  		doctor, never, never...when I do, I get startled!" Two of the case study nurses  		specifically reported that they never interacted with their patients'  		physicians directly. In two cases, nurses indicated that they had tried to  		contact the physicians multiple times about changes in patient condition or  		discharge plans without ever receiving a return call. One nurse lamented that,  		unlike hospital nurses, home care nurses have little access to their patients'  		physicians.</p>
<p> Communication between the primary nurses and the other disciplines  		involved in patient care appears to involve more regular and direct  		interaction. Nurses are in frequent contact with the aides caring for their  		patients. In both cases in which home health aide services were provided, the  		nurses did an orientation at the beginning of the aides' involvement. At one  		agency, this orientation is carried out either over the phone or at the  		patient's home. At the other agency, the orientation always takes place during  		the aide's first visit to the home. At both agencies, the nurse accompanied the  		aide on a visit to the home every 14 days. Nurses in both cases indicated that  		they were in contact with the aides at least weekly, and that the aides  		frequently called with questions or new information. One nurse indicated that,  		in her small agency, the communication between herself and the aides can be  		quite informal. She just "sees them around" the office. The other nurse  		indicated that aides complete a checklist of their activities at each visit and  		send it to the nurse once a week.</p>
<p> Case conferences are an important method of communication between home  		care nurses and other disciplines. Three of the four nurses who coordinated  		other disciplines on behalf of their patients indicated that they communicated  		with other care providers through this mechanism. At one agency, the patient's  		case was presented at an interdisciplinary case conference every other week.  		The other two nurses reported that their patients were presented at case  		conferences at start of care, recertification, discharge, and when problems  		arose. Two nurses reported that therapists and social workers inform the  		primary nurses of their plans of care after completing their initial evaluation  		visits and upon their decision to discontinue services to the patient. One  		nurse noted the importance of progress notes in providing a means of  		communication among disciplines. Another nurse identified a more informal  		mechanism for her communications with the agency social worker: "I sit right  		next to her!"</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Discharge Planning</strong></i>: All of the case study  		nurses reported that discharge planning begins very early in a patient's  		episode of care. Six of the seven nurses indicated that they began thinking  		about discharge at their first visit with the case study patients. Two nurses  		specifically commented that a plan for discharge is included in the care plan  		document that is completed at the start of care assessment. As one nurse put  		it, home care providers "have a road map from the very beginning."</p>
<p> The nurses cited numerous factors they considered in assessing the case  		study patients' readiness for discharge. All but two of the nurses cited more  		than one reason they considered their patients ready for discharge. Most of the  		nurses (five of seven) indicated that their patients were discharged because  		they were medically stable. Three nurses reported that they discharged their  		patients in part because they had reached their educational goals in terms of  		their knowledge of CHF, their medications, and diets. Two nurses noted that  		their patients were no longer homebound. Although both nurses reported that  		they would have liked to keep their patients on service, they felt obligated to  		discharge their patients because of their homebound status. The nurses  		specifically noted that any further services provided to these patients would  		not be covered by Medicare. Two nurses each reported that their patients had  		become ready for discharge by virtue of the fact that their endurance had  		increased, they or their family members were able to manage their medications,  		and/or their medication regimens had stabilized (most of the case study  		patients experienced changes in their medications and doses during the course  		of their episodes of care). In determining the case study patients' readiness  		for discharge, the following factors were considered by one nurse each:  		household safety issues had been resolved, the patient had become more  		independent in her IADLs, the patient was able to manage diet or dressing  		changes, or the patient moved out of the nurse's service area.</p>
<p> As mentioned previously, two nurses noted that they discharged their  		patients because they were no longer homebound. One nurse commented on the  		subjective nature of determinations of homebound status. She indicated that all  		of the nurses in her agency have their own personal definitions of the concept  		of homebound. This nurse reported that the definition of "homebound" according  		to Medicare is that a patient leaves home infrequently, and does so only with  		taxing effort and assistance. Her personal definition is that a patient leaves  		home less than weekly, needs the assistance of a device and/or a person to  		leave the house, and is exhausted the next day. The other nurse who discharged  		her patient because of his homebound status reported that she did not consider  		her patient homebound because he was able to go to the doctor's office once  		every three weeks with the assistance of his wife. Clearly, these two nurses  		define this important concept somewhat differently.</p>
<p> The case study nurses engaged in a variety of activities in preparation  		for discharging their patients. Most commonly, the nurses made arrangements for  		their patients' continuing needs to be met. Three nurses established plans for  		their patients' future transportation needs by arranging with friends and  		family members to assist the patients in this way. Another nurse arranged for  		family members to help the patient with meal preparation and shopping. One  		nurse commented that "in home care, you try to establish the support system --  		who is going to do what -- [these systems] often fall apart and the patient  		ends up back in home care." Two nurses made arrangements for their patients to  		begin attending an outpatient clinic or lab for continuing medical care or lab  		work. Another ensured that the IV company working with the patient was aware of  		the discharge and that the IV company nurses would continue to follow up with  		the patient. Two nurses established plans for their patients to receive  		non-agency nursing care after their discharge from home care (i.e., state  		Medicaid nurse, private nurse). One nurse provided her patient with information  		about arranging for private aide services after discharge.</p>
<p> The nurses prepared for discharge in other ways as well. Three nurses  		mentioned that they warn their patients about eventual discharge very early in  		the episode of care (two nurses talked with their patients about discharge at  		the start of care visit). The patients need to know that the nurse "is not  		going to be here forever" and that they "are going to need to be independent."  		One nurse indicated that she mentioned discharge at every visit with her  		patient.</p>
<p> Communicating with other agency personnel and the patients' physicians  		was an important part of the discharge planning process for the case study  		patients. Four of the seven nurses indicated that their patients' cases were  		presented at interdisciplinary case conferences prior to discharge. All of the  		disciplines involved in a patient's care, other agency nurses, and sometimes  		nursing supervisors and quality assurance (QA) personnel attend these  		conferences during which patient cases are reviewed and readiness for discharge  		is discussed. In addition, five of the seven nurses specifically mentioned that  		they prepared for discharge by communicating their intentions to discharge with  		the patients' physicians. </p>
<p> There are a number of actors who took part in the discharge planning  		process for the case study patients. Each of the seven nurses indicated that a  		patient's primary care nurse is an important player in the discharge  		decision-making process. However, the agencies varied in how much power is  		afforded to the primary nurse. At two of the seven agencies, the nurses  		indicated that the primary nurse has the ultimate power to make discharge  		decisions. One nurse commented that she "consider[s] this a nursing decision."  		Three other nurses reported that the decision to discharge is left primarily up  		to the primary nurse and the patient's physician. Two of these nurses noted  		that their supervisors have important influence on these decisions as well. One  		nurse reported that the primary nurse and the nursing supervisor are  		responsible for making the decision to discharge. At this agency, the branch  		manager or QA staff are brought into the decision-making process when the  		primary decision makers are in doubt about the best course of action. As  		mentioned previously, four of the agencies conduct case conferences as part of  		the discharge planning process. At these sites, all disciplines involved with a  		patient and other agency nurses provide input into discharge decisions.</p>
<h4>4. Content of the Skilled Nursing Visit</h4>
<p> Skilled care home visits are comprised of two main components: (1)  		assessment and (2) teaching. Each of the seven case study nurses mentioned  		participating in these activities at each visit with their patients. A nurse's  		assessment of a patient involves a careful examination of numerous aspects of  		the patient's condition and care plan. Assessment activities fall into five  		main categories. At each visit, the case study nurses assess their patients'  		general medical condition, mobility level, medication issues, home environment,  		and compliance with the care plan (see <a href="#table5.5">Table 5.5</a>). Most  		of the nurses noted that their initial visits were longer and more involved  		than subsequent visits. Certain activities take place mainly or only at the  		start of care visit: explaining the care plan, establishing the treatment  		goals, obtaining the patient's medical history, and completing the start of  		care paperwork. In addition, the initial assessment focuses on every aspect of  		a patient's condition, "from head to toe," whereas subsequent assessments focus  		mainly on a patient's problem areas. One nurse commented that the time spent on  		assessment decreases as the episode of care progresses because patients tend to  		become more stable with each visit.</p>

</tr></table><p> As time spent on assessment decreases, time spent on the other major  		component of the skilled nursing visit (teaching) tends to increase across the  		episode of care. Each of the nurses indicated that teaching is one of the major  		activities of their visits. Nurses educate patients about their medical  		conditions (signs and symptoms, when they should contact the physicians), their  		care plans (treatment plans and goals), their medications (purposes, schedules,  		doses, side effects, use of the IV equipment), and diet restrictions. According  		to many of the case study nurses, the topics the nurses teach change across the  		episode of care. Some nurses indicated that they taught their patients the  		information of greatest necessity or new information early in the episode of  		care. For example, after beginning to infuse her patient with his IV medication  		for the first time at the start of care visit, one nurse focused on teaching  		her patient how to disconnect from the IV pump when his six-hour infusion was  		complete. Another nurse noted that she began by teaching her patient  		information about his new medications and conditions, and then proceeded to  		teach information the patient was weak on. Two nurses indicated that they  		changed their teaching activities toward the end of their patients' episodes of  		care to emphasize the information that the patients needed to know to  		successfully care for themselves after discharge. According to these nurses, as  		a patient nears discharge, it is of particular importance that he or she know  		the signs and symptoms for which medical treatment should be sought.</p>
<p> Nurses frequently commented on the need to develop rapport with their  		patients. They suggested that the provision of medical care inside a patient's  		home requires the careful fostering of a relationship between the care provider  		and the patient. One nurse commented that "if [the patients] don't trust you,  		they don't tell you anything." To this end, three of the nurses indicated that  		an important activity during their home care visits is simply to talk to their  		patients. One nurse reported that this is especially important with an elderly  		population: "This generation of people are not complainers, they are brave  		people, stoic, so it often takes a while to identify what all of their problems  		are." </p>
<h3><a name="chapVC" id="chapVC">C. Conclusions</a></h3>
<p> The focus group and case study interviews were designed to address two  		of the key questions identified for the study:</p>
<ol><li>What is the actual practice of home health care, in terms of type,  		  amount, and decision making (e.g., care planning, care coordination)?</li>
<li>How are decisions about care made in light of Medicare coverage  		  rules?</li>
</ol><p>In this section, key findings from the focus group and case study  		interviews are discussed in relation to these questions. </p>
<h4>1. What is the Actual Practice of Home Health Care?</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Services Provided</strong></i>: Medicare home health care  		involves skilled nursing; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; medical  		social work; and aide services. Nurses are the central providers in the home  		health care system. The primary responsibilities of the home care nurses are to  		assess the patients' medical condition and needs, and to educate the patient  		and family about the patients' illnesses and treatment regimens. Patients'  		primary nurses engage in numerous other activities as well. The nurse plays an  		important role in determining a patient's care plan (e.g., frequency of visits,  		disciplines involved), managing the patient's medications, completing required  		forms, documenting the patient's case, organizing a support network for the  		patient, performing psychological counseling, and ensuring that care providers  		from different disciplines are "on the same page."</p>
<p> Care providers from other disciplines provide important services for  		patients in home health care. PT was provided to three of the seven case study  		patients to help the patients improve their strength and balance. Some patients  		were believed by their nurses to be too weak or unmotivated to benefit from PT.  		</p>
<p> The primary role of medical social workers is to identify community  		resources to assist home care patients. For two case study patients, a social  		worker was needed to identify resources for the patients (e.g., new housing,  		transportation). In a third case, the primary nurse had hoped the social worker  		could assist the patient with her anxiety about not being capable of caring for  		her dying significant other. Importantly, two of the three patients refused to  		accept the services of a social worker, leaving the primary nurses in the  		position of having to provide these services themselves.</p>
<p> Home health aides assisted two case study patients with showering, skin  		care, meal preparation, cleaning, laundry, and shopping. Aides also reminded  		the patients to take their medications, monitored the patients' weights, and  		reported changes in the patients' conditions immediately to the primary nurses.  		Three case study patients refused aide services, "as they often do."</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Factors Affecting Services Provided</strong></i>: The nurses  		participating in the focus group and case study interviews identified a number  		of factors affecting services provided to Medicare home care beneficiaries.  		Often, elderly patients receiving home care services through Medicare are  		complex patients, many having been recently discharged from hospital care.  		According to focus group participants, patients just released from the hospital  		often are sicker than other home care recipients and frequently require complex  		or high-tech services. These complex cases involve more vigilant attention from  		the nurses, as well as more frequent communication between disciplines, and  		documentation that is more excessive.</p>
<p> Although the family support network is important for all recipients of  		home health care, a number of the focus group and case study participants noted  		the special importance of family members for elderly home care recipients.  		Patients may have great difficulty caring for themselves and may need  		assistance in multiple domains of their daily lives. Focus group participants  		indicated that they consider the availability of caregivers in their decisions  		to recertify or discharge patients. Family members of the case study patients  		commonly provided assistance with ADLs, IADLs, medication management, and were  		frequently involved directly in the patients' care (e.g., accepting or refusing  		services, attending nursing visits, weighing the patients). One case study  		participant commented that these patients "are just out of luck unless they  		have family to help them." Interview participants emphasized that some home  		care patients are cared for by spouses or other family members who may be as  		old and frail as the patients themselves. </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Care Planning and Coordination</strong></i>: Substantial  		variation in the process of care planning and coordination was found among  		agencies in both the focus groups and case studies. The role of the primary  		nurse in the process of developing the patient's care plan varies from agency  		to agency. At some of the case study agencies, nurses reported that they have a  		great deal of control over a patient's care plan. Although the referring  		physician must approve the care plan at all agencies, several nurses indicated  		that the primary nurse develops the care plan and writes the orders. The  		physician simply approves the nurse's plan.</p>
<p> However, according to a number of focus group and case study  		participants, many agencies involve supervisors in the development of patients'  		care plans. They either approved the plans laid out by the primary nurses or  		worked with the primary nurses to jointly develop the plan. Although not  		definitive due to small sample size, the case study interviews suggested that  		primary nurses have greater control over the development of their patients'  		care plans in low-volume states and in non-proprietary agencies.</p>
<p> Agencies also differ in the procedure for documenting a patient's care  		plan. Most commonly, the case study nurses indicated that a patient's care plan  		is documented in the nursing notes or care plan forms developed by the  		agencies. Nurses noted that a patient's care plan can be documented through the  		assessment forms, orders, teaching guides, and clinical pathways as well.</p>
<p> Communication among care providers appears to be fairly consistent  		across agencies. The focus group participants indicated that the process of  		coordinating care for patients begins immediately at the start of care. The  		case study nurses reported that they generally communicate with their patients'  		physicians only at milestone time points in the episodes of care. Nurses  		communicate with physicians at the start of care and as the patient approaches  		recertification or discharge. In between these time points, nurses tend to  		contact the physicians only when changes occur in a patient's condition or  		treatment plan. Contact with physicians is nearly always made indirectly  		through the physician's nursing staff. "You never get the doctor, never,  		never," one nurse reported. Some of the case study nurses reported having  		difficulty getting return calls from their patients' physicians. </p>
<p> Communication between the primary nurses and other care providers is  		fairly regular and direct. The case study nurses reported being in contact with  		their patients' aides at least weekly. In addition, the nurses made home visits  		with the aides every two weeks. The nurses also indicated that the aides  		frequently call with questions or new information about a patient.</p>
<p> Case conferences are a main mechanism through which care providers of  		different disciplines stay in contact regarding their patients. Most of the  		case study nurses who coordinated other disciplines on behalf of their patients  		were in contact with those other providers at case conferences. Generally,  		patients are presented at conferences at the start of care, recertification,  		discharge, and when problems arise. In addition, therapists and social workers  		generally contact the primary nurse once they have developed their own care  		plans for a patient. </p>
<p> Discharge planning begins very early in the home care episode, usually  		at the first visit. Nurses cited a number of factors that they consider in  		determining a patient's readiness for discharge: patient is medically stable,  		the educational goals have been reached, the patient is no longer homebound,  		services will no longer be covered by Medicare, the patient's medication  		regimen has been stabilized, the patient has increased endurance, and the  		patient is able to manage his or her medications.</p>
<p> Nurses engage in a variety of activities in planning for a patient's  		discharge. Most commonly, nurses make arrangements for the patient's continuing  		needs to be met after discharge (e.g., identify resources to assist with  		transportation, meal preparation). Communicating with other care providers  		through case conferencing and other methods of interaction is an important  		component of the discharge-planning process. </p>
<h4>2. How Are Decisions About Care Made In Light Of  		Medicare Coverage Rules?</h4>
<p> The focus group and case study interviews provided important  		information about the decision-making process in home health care.  		Recertification and discharge decisions are based on a number of factors,  		including patient factors (e.g., living environment), agency factors (e.g.,  		supervision of decision-making process), and external factors (e.g., IPS).</p>
<p> A lack of clarity in and failure to fully understand federal  		regulations has a major impact on the decision-making process in home health  		care. The nurses who participated in the focus group and case study interviews  		indicated that some of the critical concepts of the Medicare coverage rules are  		unclear. Specifically, nurses referred to the difficulty they and others have  		understanding the HIM-11, the concept of "homebound," what constitutes skilled  		nursing care, and what M&amp;E is and when it can be used. One nurse suggested  		that "you have to be a lawyer" to understand the regulations. </p>
<p> Focus group and case study nurses alike reported that the definition of  		"homebound," a critical feature of the Medicare coverage rules, is unclear.  		Interview participants suggested that the definition is quite subjective. When  		asked what the definition of "homebound" is, one case study nurse asked "do you  		mean <em>the</em> definition of homebound, or <em>my</em> definition of  		homebound." This nurse reported that all of the nurses in her agency have their  		own personal definitions of this concept. Although the nurses involved in the  		focus group interviews differed in their interpretations of homebound status as  		well, they agreed that a patient who drives cannot be considered homebound. It  		is important to note that, according to Medicare coverage rules, the ability to  		drive per se does not make a patient ineligible for Medicare home health  		services. </p>
<p> Some of the focus group participants indicated that there is  		uncertainty in the field about what constitutes skilled nursing care. In  		discussing the patient vignettes, the nurses disagreed about whether the  		services needed by these patients represented skilled care. In particular, the  		nurses were uncertain whether wound care represented a skilled need. Further,  		it appears that nurses are not the only members of the medical community who  		are unclear about what constitutes skilled nursing care. Nurses reported that  		physicians often refer patients to home care who do not need skilled nursing  		services.</p>
<p> M&amp;E also appears to be an elusive concept. Focus group  		participants' understanding of M&amp;E differed widely from agency to agency.  		Some nurses indicated that M&amp;E applied to patients with IV therapy and  		family members who were not able to learn the medication regimen. Other nurses  		suggested that M&amp;E was appropriate only for complex patients with multiple  		caregivers, needing many hours of service. A few nurses even thought that  		M&amp;E requires special training for nurses.</p>
<p> The focus group and case study interviews produced no evidence that the  		lack of clarity in coverage rules encourages home care providers to continue to  		provide services to patients who may be ready for discharge. Despite the wide  		variation in their understanding of the concept of "homebound," the nurses  		participating in these interviews did not appear to use the ambiguity of this  		concept to their advantage. In fact, two of the case study patients were  		discharged before the nurses felt they were ready specifically because the  		nurses no longer considered the patients to be homebound. The focus group  		participants reported that patients who drive cannot be considered homebound.  		Because of this misinterpretation of the Medicare coverage rules, these nurses  		may discharge patients who might legitimately be considered homebound. </p>
<p> Not only was there no evidence that ambiguity in coverage rules leads  		to the provision of unnecessary services, there was some suggestion in the  		focus group and case study data that this ambiguity may actually result in  		shorter episodes of care. One focus group participant indicated that "in a case  		where you might be borderline on discharging or making another visit, [her  		agency] would lean toward not making another visit for fear of Medicare  		review." </p>
<p> The focus group interviews produced some evidence that agencies may  		avoid the use of services for which the coverage rules are ambiguous. Many  		focus group participants appear to be uncertain what M&amp;E is and when it can  		be used. During most of the focus group interviews, nurses simply indicated  		that M&amp;E is not used at their agencies. Although none of the participants  		specifically made this suggestion, it may be that agencies have eliminated the  		use of M&amp;E due to concerns that these services will not be covered.  		Uncertainty about the meaning of the coverage rules with regard to M&amp;E may  		have encouraged agencies to avoid the practice altogether.</p>
<p> A number of the focus group and case study participants noted that the  		additional documentation required under the new federal regulations has  		increased the pressure on home care nurses. Several nurses involved in the  		focus groups indicated that they feel a sense of paranoia about the patient  		documentation process. Some reported that every "i" has to be dotted and every  		"t" has to be crossed in documenting a patient's case. If documentation is  		vague or incomplete, visits will be denied. One nurse reported that "it makes  		[her] nervous to think that what [she] writes in the notes will determine  		whether the agency will get paid" for her services. In the face of more careful  		scrutiny of the field of home health care and a lack of clarity in the coverage  		rules, nurses seem to prefer to discharge a patient rather than take the chance  		that their services will not be covered. </p>
<h2><a name="chapVI" id="chapVI">VI. PROVIDER PERSPECTIVES ON THE INTERIM PAYMENT  		SYSTEM AND CHANGES IN HOME HEALTH CARE</a></h2>
<p> The study was not originally intended to assess the impact of the  		Interim Payment System (IPS). However, the timing of the project allowed for  		the acquisition and synthesis of information from several sources on how this  		and other policy changes have affected the field of home health care. As noted  		previously, the impact of IPS, as perceived by the home care industry, was  		examined through interviews of state home care association representatives and  		study agency administrators, as well as through focus group and case study  		interviews with home care nurses. The findings from each of these qualitative  		methods are summarized in this chapter.</p>
<p> Although these four interview methods provided valuable qualitative  		information regarding the effects of recent policy changes on home health care,  		it is important to note that the data gathered through these methods are not  		based on a random sample of home care providers, administrators, and state  		association representatives. The information that this sample of participants  		provided with regard to the impact of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) on  		their states and agencies thus may not be an accurate reflection of the impact  		that the BBA has had on home health care nationwide. Further, as noted earlier,  		home health nurses, administrators, and state association representatives are  		stakeholders in the industry and may feel negatively toward new federal  		policies that restrict the growth of spending on the Medicare home health  		benefit. Some of these individuals also may not be fully informed about the  		historical context and goals underpinning new policies and payment  		structures.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVIA" id="chapVIA">A. State Home Care Association  		Interviews</a></h3>
<h4>1. Overview of Findings</h4>
<p> This section provides a general overview of the findings from the state  		home care association interviews, followed by state-specific information.  		Although state association representatives varied somewhat in their responses,  		their overall message was one of increased financial stringency under Medicare.  		This included not only IPS, but also related policy initiatives such as  		Operation Restore Trust (ORT)<sup><font><a href="#note45">45</a></font></sup> and the surety bond provisions of the BBA of  		1997. As a consequence, some associations indicated a trend among agencies to  		provide fewer Medicare services, shift to Medicaid and managed care, and avoid  		high-cost Medicare patients. Agency closures, downsizing, and mergers were  		frequently noted, as was the perception that home care providers, particularly  		nurses, are leaving the field. Although definitive data on access were not  		obtained from these interviews, several respondents suggested that these  		changes have created access problems for Medicare patients (especially rural  		patients), resulting in the provision of fewer services than needed to those  		who are able to obtain care. Responses were similar between high-volume and  		low-volume states.</p>
<p> OSCAR data maintained by HCFA provide additional information about  		changes in the home care market as a result of the implementation of IPS and  		other regulatory changes. <a href="#table6.1">Table 6.1</a> presents the number  		of active agencies, the number of newly certified agencies, and the number of  		agency closures in the eight study states and nationally during 1997, 1998, and  		1999.<sup><font><a href="#note46">46</a></font></sup> In 1997, the  		year the BBA was passed, there were 10,071 home health care agencies in the  		country approved to provide Medicare/Medicaid services. Nearly 9% of those  		agencies originally received their Medicare/Medicaid certifications in that  		year. Slightly over 5% of active agencies closed during 1997. In five of the  		eight study states, more agencies received Medicare/Medicaid certification than  		closed that year.</p>
<p> The pattern of agency certifications and closures was quite different  		in 1998 (the first full year of IPS) and 1999. Less than 2% of active agencies  		in 1998 were newly certified, whereas more than 14% of active agencies closed  		in that year. All but one of the study states had more agency closures than new  		certifications in 1998. The pattern of market changes was quite similar in  		1999.</p>
<p> The 1998 and 1999 agency closure percentages varied considerably  		between and within the state volume groups. The percentage of agencies that  		closed was considerably higher in the high-volume than the low-volume states.  		However, this difference is primarily due to the large number and percentage of  		closures in Texas in both years. Within the low-volume group, Oregon  		experienced a relatively large percentage of agency closures in 1998 and 1999.  		In the high-volume group, Georgia experienced a fairly small percentage of  		closures. Thus, no clear difference in the closure pattern was evident between  		the two state volume groups. </p>

<p> This section summarizes, for each state, the comments made by state  		association representatives with regard to changes that have occurred in the  		field of home health care as a result of the implementation of IPS. Although  		the data are presented here by state volume group, the general trends were  		similar across all states. Quantitative statements by respondents were not  		verified or checked against any other data sources. Therefore, they should be  		considered primarily a reflection of the views on IPS that are held by provider  		associations and their members.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Low-Volume States</strong></i>: <i>Minnesota</i> home care  		agencies have adjusted to reduced Medicare revenues, increased administrative  		expenses due to OASIS data collection and IPS, and the pervasive attitude that  		the industry is full of fraud and abuse. According to the state association  		representative, a major impact that IPS has had in rural parts of Minnesota is  		a reduction in access to care. There have been some agency closures, but mostly  		mergers and downsizing. In addition, there is a general trend across the whole  		state to provide fewer Medicare services. This reduction is occurring in home  		care agencies, hospitals, and county boards. When possible, home care agencies  		are billing Medicaid rather than Medicare. Agencies are refusing to admit  		certain types of patients, especially Medicare and/or long-stay patients.  		Minnesota residents appear willing and able to pay privately for services. The  		number of home health licenses that are not Medicare certified is increasing,  		as is the number of new assisted living facilities. </p>
<p> Compared to other states, <i>New Jersey</i> appears to be impacted less  		strongly by IPS. According to the state association representative, there are  		staff shortages due to layoffs at the middle management level. However, there  		has not been a large number of agency closures. It has been difficult to hire  		home care aides due to the strong economy in New Jersey. Some agencies are not  		accepting certain types of patients (e.g., those with high-technology needs,  		severe wounds, those requiring more than one visit per day and/or longer than  		average visits). The state has a Medicare maximization program; therefore, cost  		shifting to Medicaid is not occurring.</p>
<p> Although <i>Oregon</i> agencies are predominantly hospital-based, most  		of the agencies that have closed in Oregon have been freestanding proprietary  		agencies. Oregon is considered at low risk for fraud, and ORT has not had an  		impact on agency closures. Hospital-based agencies have managed to remain open  		and avoid problems with patient access, although if these agencies were to  		close, rural patients might have a difficult time obtaining home care services.  		According to the state association representative, most patients in Oregon  		needing home health care receive some visits, although perhaps not as many as  		they need. Currently, only a few agencies (mostly freestanding proprietary  		agencies) are turning away long-term and/or high-utilization patients. </p>
<p> Agencies in Oregon are challenged to reduce overhead administrative  		costs due to the new per-beneficiary and per-visit cost limits. Oregon's  		historically low utilization has caused increasing difficulty in absorbing  		costs over a small number of visits. The significant presence of managed care  		in Oregon also has caused agencies to downsize and cut costs.</p>
<p> The market for home care staff is tightening and there is a perception  		that nurses are leaving home care for other industries. This movement of nurses  		out of home care may be in part due to the increase in the burden of paperwork.  		Home care agencies have had difficulty retaining nurses hired from hospital  		settings because of the heavier documentation burden in home care.</p>
<p> Since 1997, <i>Pennsylvania</i> has seen a substantial number of agency  		closures. According to the state association representative, the average home  		care agency is unable to stay under cap limits and will lose $275,000 under  		IPS, forcing agencies to find ways of cutting losses. Twelve thousand jobs in  		Pennsylvania were lost from downsizing alone, not counting agency closures. No  		Pennsylvania agencies were surveyed as part of ORT, and only four Pennsylvania  		agencies have "been in trouble" with HCFA over the past 13 years.</p>
<p> The average number of visits in Pennsylvania in 1997 was 44, compared  		with 72 nationally. The state association representative reported that visits  		in the state are down 30%, and suggested that patients may be experiencing  		difficulty gaining access to home health services. Providers do not take  		high-need and long-term patients, reducing access to care for such patients. In  		addition, agencies are attempting to rely on state programs in which access has  		become restricted as well. New state programs, in development before IPS, have  		yet to be implemented.</p>
<p> In addition to IPS, agencies have struggled with other recent policy  		changes, such as the surety bond regulation, the implementation of OASIS, and  		the fifteen-minute billing requirement. According to this state association  		representative, "There is just a parade of regulatory burdens of greater or  		lesser degree of merit that agencies have to bear when reimbursement is being  		decreased."</p>
<p>	<i><strong>High-Volume States</strong></i>: In <i>Georgia</i>, the  		biggest impact of IPS has been on patients living in rural areas. The Georgia  		state home care association representative indicated that home care was serving  		as a stopgap to prevent medium- to long-stay patients from being admitted to  		nursing homes. Now, those same patients are going to high-cost modalities of  		care such as the emergency room and long-term care facilities. Other patients  		are not getting the care they need.</p>
<p> Home care agencies are trying to shift costs to Medicaid; however, the  		program does not have sufficient funds. Georgia has a community care Medicaid  		waiver program but it is operating at nearly full capacity. There are not  		enough slots remaining to absorb patients who have been discharged from home  		health care. Agencies have reduced their workforce by a third. The Georgia  		Association of Home Health Agencies has closed its Atlanta office, laid off its  		executive director, and experienced a significant cut in membership.</p>
<p> At the same time that agencies in <i>Massachusetts</i> have been  		adjusting to the new payment system, they also have been recovering from ORT.  		The state association representative noted that a large number of closures and  		mergers has caused some hospital discharge staff to experience difficulties in  		referring patients to home care agencies. There is concern that if Medicaid  		reimbursement rates do not increase or Medicare policy does not change, more  		agency closures will occur.</p>
<p> The state association representative stated that referrals to personal  		care services have increased but that patients who have received the maximum  		allowable personal care services through the state and who do not qualify for  		Medicare services are "falling through the cracks." It is unclear what is  		happening to this group of patients with respect to receiving assistance.  		Beneficiaries are unwilling to purchase private pay personal care services  		since they expect the Federal Government to provide that care. Home care  		agencies are putting more emphasis on educating family caregivers so that they  		can play a larger role in providing care.</p>
<p> The state has a Medicare maximization program and, therefore, is not  		experiencing cost shifting to Medicaid. Because Medicaid reimbursement rates  		are lower than Medicare reimbursement rates, agencies are motivated to obtain  		payment from Medicare. In addition, because eligibility requirements are the  		same for Medicare and Medicaid, a patient who does not qualify for Medicare  		services also will not qualify for Medicaid services. If cost shifting is  		occurring, it is happening in hospitals. </p>
<p> The state association representative from Massachusetts expressed that  		many home care agencies are operating at a loss and are using endowments in  		order to remain in operation. Before the BBA went into effect, home health  		aides were one of the fastest growing classes of workers in the state. However,  		as the Massachusetts economy continues to strengthen, it is becoming more and  		more difficult to attract home health workers. Agencies are competing with  		department stores and the fast food industry for home health aide staff. </p>
<p> Medicare recipients are confused about the Medicare home care benefit.  		Although the services and coverage rules have largely remained the same, the  		reimbursement rate has dropped and therefore, the volume of services has  		decreased. The lack of public awareness regarding this policy change has left  		home health agencies with the responsibility of educating patients about  		changes in policy. According to the state association representative, patients  		are not aware of recent regulatory changes affecting home health agencies and  		think that the decrease in services is driven by profit. </p>
<p> The state of <i>Mississippi</i> has not experienced a large number of  		agency closures. However, some branch offices have closed and/or declared  		bankruptcy. According to the Mississippi association representative, patients  		with chronic conditions (e.g., stroke, paraplegia) are reaching the  		per-beneficiary limit and are not getting all of the services they  		need.<sup><font><a href="#note47">47</a></font></sup> For many  		agencies, there are not enough short-term patients to offset the costs of  		long-term patients. As a result, according to the association representative,  		agencies are not accepting very sick patients. Because Medicaid funding is  		limited and the program approves few visits, agencies have not attempted to  		shift costs from Medicare to Medicaid.</p>
<p> The <i>Texas</i> home care association representative indicated that  		the state has experienced dramatic changes in the delivery of home health care.  		There has been a large decrease in the number of parent and branch home care  		agencies, particularly in rural areas. Prior to the BBA going into effect,  		there were 18 counties with no home care agencies and less than six counties  		with only one agency per county. According to the association representative,  		as of July 1999, there were 43 counties in which no home care agencies were  		located and 53 counties in which only one agency each was located. The majority  		of counties that are underserved are in the panhandle and western parts of  		Texas. There is one county in western Texas that has 350 Medicare  		beneficiaries. The county covers 6,000 square miles and has not had a home  		health agency for two years. All of the agencies in surrounding counties have  		closed as well. Many beneficiaries in rural areas no longer have choices among  		home health agencies, since at most there is only one agency serving an area.  		Anecdotal information suggests that the census in nursing homes located in the  		panhandle and western part of the state has increased, but that the facilities  		are unable to keep up with the demand. </p>
<p> The Texas association representative suggested that therapy services  		for rural patients may have become more limited under the tighter reimbursement  		of the IPS period. The provision of care to rural patients is particularly  		challenging in Texas, a large state with a sizable rural population. The  		respondent noted further that therapists have been unwilling to drive long  		distances under the current reimbursement system. Thus, needed therapy services  		often are not provided. Patients are confused about why they are not getting  		services for which they are eligible.</p>
<p> Although Texas has one of the largest home and community-based waiver  		programs in the country, the funding is capped. From August 1998 through June  		1999, enrollment in the program was closed and no beneficiaries were enrolled.  		Currently, the program serves approximately 23,000 people but there are  		approximately 9,000 people on the waiting list.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVIB" id="chapVIB">B. Administrator Interviews</a></h3>
<p> Interviews were conducted with the administrators of 54 of the 56 study  		agencies in order to collect information about how home health practice  		patterns have changed in response to IPS.<sup><font><a href="#note48">48</a></font></sup> This section of the report summarizes the  		interview findings. The findings are presented under subheadings that  		correspond to the interview questions as they were asked of the agency  		administrators. (<a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a> contains a list of the  		questions asked during the administrator interviews.) To the extent possible,  		the qualitative findings were compared between the high- and low-volume states  		and between proprietary and non-proprietary agencies. (No comparisons were made  		between hospital-based and freestanding agencies, due largely to the  		similarities in responses across all agencies, which are described in the  		following discussion.)</p>
<h4>1. How Has IPS Affected Your Administrative and Staffing  		Practices?</h4>
<p> Agency administrators in all ownership and volume categories reported  		that IPS has affected the administrative and staffing practices their agencies.  		The changes most commonly reported are reductions in operating expenses and  		staff (administrative and clinical). Those agencies least affected by IPS  		either made changes just prior to IPS or are still not prepared for IPS (e.g.,  		one administrator did not yet know the per-beneficiary limit for the agency).  		The following subsections of the report describe the findings from the  		administrative and staffing practice questions that were included in the  		interview protocol. These questions focused on approaches that agencies might  		take in an effort to cut costs or increase non-Medicare revenues in response to  		tighter Medicare fiscal constraints.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Using Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) Rather Than  		Registered Nurses (RNs)</strong></i>: Agencies in all categories reported that  		they are not using licensed practical nurses (LPNs), primarily because LPNs  		cannot do OASIS assessments, have limited clinical roles, and require  		supervision. For these reasons, agency administrators stated that it is not  		cost-effective to hire LPNs or to keep them on staff. Agencies that had LPNs on  		staff are reassigning them to office positions and not filling position  		vacancies. Unlike other agencies, administrators from a few rural agencies  		stated that LPNs are not available in their area and that they might consider  		hiring one or two to do follow-up visits if they were available.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Productivity Standards</strong></i>: Approximately equal  		numbers of agency administrators reported increasing productivity standards as  		those that reported no change in standards. This finding is consistent across  		agency categories. The average productivity standard quoted is approximately  		five visits per day. High-volume proprietary agencies require approximately  		seven visits per day. Administrators who reported no change in standards often  		stated that they had increased productivity standards at their agencies prior  		to the implementation of IPS and therefore did not need to make any further  		changes. Non-proprietary agencies in public health settings (such as county  		health departments) did not increase standards because nurses have various  		teaching responsibilities and it is difficult to enforce fair standards for all  		staff.</p>
<p> Agencies that have increased standards have used a variety of  		strategies to decrease office time: requiring staff to call in for pre-approval  		of overtime, using peer assessments of productivity, adjusting productivity  		standards on a daily basis, and using point of service computer systems.  		Administrators from the proprietary agencies in high-volume states reported  		that productivity is constantly monitored and all staff members are carrying a  		heavier workload than they once did. One administrator reported that increasing  		productivity standards at this time represents a "catch 22" situation because  		OASIS implementation requires more time to complete paperwork.</p>
<p> Unexpectedly, administrators from two agencies reported lowering  		productivity standards. A non-proprietary agency in the low-volume state group  		lowered productivity standards during OASIS implementation, but now standards  		are back to the same level. A proprietary agency in a high-volume state lowered  		productivity standards on a more long-term basis. This particular agency has  		been unable to recruit experienced bilingual home health nurses and, therefore,  		has hired nurses with no home health experience. For this agency, maintaining  		quality bicultural/bilingual care remains a priority above productivity  		standards and documentation deadlines.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Standardized Care Plans</strong></i>: The use of  		standardized care plans is mixed across the state volume and agency ownership  		categories. Administrators from most proprietary agencies in high-volume states  		reported using standardized care plans. Changes have not been made to these  		care plans as a result of IPS. However, a few such agencies do not use care  		plans at all and a few others use teaching guides but not care plans. There are  		no strong themes represented among the non-proprietary agencies in either the  		low-volume or the high-volume states. The responses from the administrators of  		these agencies were mixed with respect to use of care plans; some agencies use  		them, others do not. However, these agencies generally use care plans less  		frequently than do high-volume proprietary agencies. Few of these agencies have  		made changes to their care plan protocols as a result of IPS.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Contracts with Managed Care Organizations  		(MCOs)</strong></i>: The extent to which agencies have contracts with MCOs  		appears to vary by agency ownership and state volume. These differences are  		summarized by category below.</p>
<ul><li><em>Proprietary Agencies in High-Volume States</em>: Proprietary  		  agencies in high-volume states are increasing managed care contracts as a  		  result of IPS. They are seeking and obtaining more contracts in order to have a  		  diversity of payers. Administrators from some agencies reported wanting to  		  decrease their Medicare caseload and to increase private payers. The only  		  exceptions are the proprietary agencies in high-volume rural southern states,  		  where managed care contracts are not available.</li>
<li><em>Non-proprietary Agencies in High-Volume States</em>: These  		  agencies generally do not have contracts with MCOs and this has not changed due  		  to IPS. The administrators of these agencies stated that they receive less  		  reimbursement per visit from managed care and that working with managed care  		  companies is very time consuming.</li>
<li><em>Proprietary Agencies in Low-Volume States</em>: The proprietary  		  agencies in low-volume states also do not have many MCO contracts, but they are  		  split equally in their desire to obtain such contracts. Some agencies are  		  actively seeking contracts, whereas others are not.</li>
<li><em>Non-proprietary Agencies in Low-Volume States</em>: These  		  agencies have contracts with MCOs, but these contracts have not changed due to  		  IPS. A few of these agencies are trying to obtain more MCO contracts, and a few  		  others are trying to renegotiate their contracts. Administrators from these  		  agencies also noted that working with MCOs is problematic with regard to  		  quality of care and reimbursement.</li>
</ul><p>	<i><strong>Administrative Costs</strong></i>: Administrators of  		agencies in all state volume and agency ownership categories reported making  		significant cuts in administrative costs and "doing more for less." These  		cutbacks include staff decreases, hiring freezes, decreases in salaries and  		benefits, reduced (or eliminated) mileage reimbursement, cuts in continuing  		education and staff training, reduction in overhead expenses, and merging of  		administrative positions (i.e., "wearing ten different hats"). The  		administrator of one high-volume proprietary agency reported a 25% staff  		decrease. Some agencies can no longer afford to maintain JCAHO certification  		and most agencies are no longer providing supplies to patients. Although  		decreases in administrative costs have occurred in all categories of agencies,  		administrators of a few low-volume non-proprietary agencies noted that they  		have not cut clinical staff. This, however, does not appear to be true for the  		majority of agencies.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Billing/Accounting</strong></i>: Few of the agencies in the  		four categories reported a substantial change in billing/accounting practices.  		Of those that have made changes, some have installed or upgraded their  		computerized billing systems, and others are spending more time on  		cross-checking accounting data with back-up documentation. One administrator  		said this cross-checking process has been a "Goliath." A few agencies have  		restructured their staff (added or deleted positions), and several agencies  		noted that incremental billing was very problematic when it was required. In  		contrast to most of the administrators' comments, one administrator reported  		that the changes resulting from IPS have been good for the agency and have  		enhanced efficiency with authorization and verification.</p>
<h4>2. In What Ways Has IPS Affected the Structure of Care  		That You Provide?</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Types of Patients</strong></i>: The majority of home health  		agencies are seeing more patients with complex and acute care needs since the  		implementation of IPS. According to the administrators interviewed, patients  		are frequently discharged from the hospital sooner than they once were and many  		of these patients require complex acute care, often with specialized  		technology. Some home health agencies are choosing not to accept these  		patients, whereas most agencies are committed to not refusing care to anyone.  		According to the administrators of agencies that do not refuse care, agency  		closures in rural areas often result in special needs patients who must be seen  		at long distances.</p>
<p> As mentioned above, although the majority of agencies in all subgroups  		do not refuse patients, there are a few agencies that do report refusing  		service to long-stay patients, wound care patients, and patients that require  		more than one visit per day. Some of these agencies also refuse patients who  		require complex care involving specialized technologies. There is no evidence  		from the interview data that certain types of agencies are more likely to  		refuse care. </p>
<p> The agencies that accept all referrals are experiencing other changes  		in their case mix. These changes differ by state volume group, as summarized  		below.</p>
<ul><li><em>Agencies in High-Volume States</em>: Administrators from agencies  		  in high-volume states (both proprietary and non-proprietary) report that they  		  do not refuse patients regardless of cost, acuity, or required visit intensity.  		  However, these agencies are seeking a balance of short-stay and long-stay  		  patients and are working with physicians to improve their referral case mix,  		  including targeting physicians and clinics with short-stay patients. Some  		  agencies in the high-volume states have had a decrease in their overall census  		  since the changes in venipuncture coverage. Administrators from other  		  non-proprietary agencies in high-volume states are concerned about financial  		  losses incurred when their agencies exceed their per-beneficiary limits and  		  per-visit cost limits.</li>
<li><em>Agencies in Low-Volume States</em>: Administrators of agencies in  		  the low-volume states reported receiving complex patients that have been turned  		  away by other agencies or that have been discharged early from the hospital.  		  Given the changes in the nursing home industry, it also has become more  		  difficult for these agencies to place patients in long-term care facilities.  		  Some agencies are working with hospital social workers to improve assessment of  		  patients for nursing homes. Other agencies are cutting back on the number of  		  chronic patients they will admit and are referring more patients to waiver  		  programs. The administrator of one low-volume non-proprietary agency expressed  		  concern about going out of business due to financial losses incurred from  		  treating chronic and complex patients.</li>
</ul><p> Finally, several agencies across all ownership and volume categories  		appear to be experiencing changes in the referral patterns of home health  		patients from physicians. Some agencies have had an increase in referrals from  		new physicians with whom they have never before worked. These agencies do not  		necessarily accept these new referrals, particularly if the physician does not  		refer short-stay patients. Other agencies report that physicians do not refer  		patients to home health as often as they once did because the physicians are  		frightened by HCFA warnings regarding fraud and abuse or they do not think the  		patient will be accepted by the home health agency. </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Geographic Location of Patients</strong></i>: Most agencies  		in all subgroups have maintained their geographic service area. Of those  		agencies that have made changes to their geographic area, some have decreased  		it due to increased mileage expenses and are no longer serving long-distance  		patients. Other agencies have increased their coverage areas in order to serve  		rural patients who are no longer served by other agencies. The administrator of  		one such agency reported that if a nurse travels a long distance, the visit  		often is much longer than average, especially just before a weekend. In this  		way, the shifts in geographical coverage may result in changes to home health  		visit intensity. However, it is unclear from these data if this pattern is  		widespread or if access to home health care for rural patients has been  		significantly affected at this time.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Types of Visits Provided (e.g., Aide vs.  		Skilled)</strong></i>: Administrators of agencies in all subgroups report  		providing fewer aide visits and more social work visits than they did prior to  		the implementation of IPS. As noted below in the discussion of alternative  		services, this escalation in the provision of social work services likely  		results from an increased focus on identifying community resources for  		patients. In addition, all agencies, except high-volume proprietary agencies,  		report a decrease in PT visits (high-volume proprietary agencies have increased  		the number of PT visits). Most agencies continue to provide the types of  		services that patients need and emphasize that patient care remains their  		priority. However, one low-volume non-proprietary agency no longer provides  		services requiring complex technology.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Content of Visit</strong></i>: Agencies in all subgroups  		reported either a greater emphasis on teaching and care coordination or no  		change in the content of visits. Many administrators stated that helping the  		patient achieve independence is more of a focus now and that safety and  		medication management issues are addressed early in the episode of care.  		Teaching and coordination activities are intensified early in the episode of  		care, a process that was described as "cramming" and "concentrating" services  		in the first few visits with a patient. Agencies also are getting families  		involved in caregiving earlier in the episode. Many administrators reported  		that families are willingly taking on these increased responsibilities.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Volume of Visits</strong></i>: The total volume of visits  		provided has decreased across all subgroups. The patterns associated with this  		decrease include reduced referrals from physicians, decreases associated with  		loss of patients who need only venipuncture services, reduced aide visits, and  		concentration of skilled nursing visits early in the treatment episode. Most  		administrators report that this decrease is distributed across all types of  		patients. However, at one high-volume proprietary agency, visit volume has  		decreased for chronic patients, but increased for acute patients.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Length of Stay</strong></i>: Length of stay in home health  		has decreased for agencies in all subgroups with the exception of a few  		agencies in each category that have had no change in episode length. The  		administrators that reported no change in length of stay usually also stated  		that they have enough short-stay patients in their case mix to offset the  		long-stay patients. Otherwise, the majority of administrators reported  		decreases in their lengths of stay, reductions that appear to be distributed  		across all types of patients with the exception of two proprietary agencies.  		Administrators from these two proprietary agencies reported reduced length of  		stay only for chronic patients. Some administrators reported being concerned  		that patients are sometimes discharged too soon from home health care and that  		this might result in increased rehospitalizations or readmissions to home  		care.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Intensity</strong></i>: As discussed in <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>, the average number of visits per patient  		decreased in both high- and low-volume states following the implementation of  		IPS (see <a href="#table3.1">Table 3.1</a>). Although the percent of reduction  		in the average number of visits per patient was only slightly larger in the  		high- than the low-volume states, agency administrators from the high-volume  		states reported greater changes in the intensity of services provided (number  		of visits per week) than did their counterparts in the low-volume states.  		According to their administrators, most agencies in the high-volume states are  		providing fewer visits per week and providing visits earlier in the treatment  		episode. These agencies also have increased care coordination activities to  		determine the patient's individual needs for care and services. Administrators  		in low-volume states reported that visit intensity has not changed greatly at  		their agencies and that they continue to base the number of visits provided on  		patient needs. However, these administrators reported that their agencies  		provide more visits earlier in the episode and provide more visits per week  		after a patient returns home from a rehospitalization.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Alternative Services</strong></i>: Study agency  		administrators reported having increased patient referrals to community  		resources for care and homemaking services. This trend was apparent across all  		categories of agencies, but was particularly pronounced for agencies in  		high-volume states. These agencies have increased time spent coordinating care,  		use more community resources, utilize social work services earlier in the  		treatment episode, and work more closely with physicians to develop alternative  		strategies for patients. Agencies in low-volume states also have begun to  		involve social workers and community resources more heavily, although they  		already were using alternative resources fairly extensively prior to the  		implementation of IPS.</p>
<h4>3. How Have the Reduction in Visit Cost Limits and the  		New Per-Beneficiary Limits Specifically Affected Your Agency?</h4>
<p> The responses to this question in many ways echo the responses to the  		previous questions and no new issues were raised. However, administrators'  		responses to this question emphasize the financial impact of IPS. Many  		administrators discussed cash flow problems, payback plans, anticipated future  		losses, and the need to become more cost efficient. In addition,  		non-proprietary agencies in both volume groups are trying to decrease the  		number of repeat patients because the per-beneficiary limits are problematic,  		especially for agencies in low-volume states. On the other hand, administrators  		from proprietary agencies in the high-volume states reported less difficulty  		with the per-beneficiary limits and more concern with staying under the  		per-visit cost limits.</p>
<h4>4. How Is Your Agency Preparing for Prospective  		Payment?</h4>
<p> The responses to this question were very specific to each agency but  		there were four common themes across all categories of agencies:</p>
<ul><li>Increasing the use of standardized care plans for prospective  		  payment,</li>
<li>Continuing to monitor current volume and costs in preparation for  		  implementation of PPS,</li>
<li>Increasing staff education regarding policy issues, and</li>
<li>Waiting to prepare for PPS until more is known.</li>
</ul><p> Administrator attitudes about PPS are mixed. Some are looking forward  		to PPS and think that it will be an improvement over IPS. Others are  		pessimistic and fear that PPS could put their agencies out of business. The  		following are some examples of the variety of perceptions expressed by the  		administrators regarding PPS:</p>
<ul><li>"We are trying not to panic."</li>
<li>"I can't do anything. I will do what I have to do, but am not doing  		  anything in particular now. We will be okay because we don't provide excessive  		  services."</li>
<li>"I'm not sure if PPS went into effect tomorrow that we would make  		  it."</li>
<li>"We're as lean and mean as we can get. Home health is not as fluffy  		  as it used to be."</li>
<li>"The BBA overreacted. The industry needed some changes, but most  		  people did not understand the impact of BBA. Now it's like turning a battleship  		  around."</li>
<li>"PPS might be an improvement and provide more opportunity to  		  plan."</li>
</ul><h3><a name="chapVIC" id="chapVIC">C. Focus Group Interviews</a></h3>
<p> At the beginning of each focus group interview, participants were asked  		how the field of home care has changed during their years in practice. Many of  		the responses to this question were not specific to IPS. Nurses reported  		important changes in the following five areas: (1) case mix, (2) patient  		education, (3) caregiver education, (4) goals of patient care, and (5) quality  		of care.</p>
<h4>1. Case Mix</h4>
<p> Several factors affecting agency case mix already have been noted. In  		particular, participants reported that patients admitted to home care are  		sicker and more complex than they once were. Many patients have acute problems  		or persisting active symptoms of their disease. Patient complexity has  		increased, with many patients requiring high-technology treatment (e.g.,  		advanced wound care, IV administration of drugs with increased risk of  		complications and side effects, chemotherapy, chest tubes, and the operation or  		management of equipment with risk for patient injury or complication). Because  		of this increase in the number of patients with high-tech needs, there has been  		an increasing need for nurses with high-tech skills. Nurses also reported that  		these complicated patients require more immediate care and attention.</p>
<p> Participants from all agencies suggested that home care patients are  		sicker than they once were because they are discharged from hospital care  		earlier than in the past. Nurses from one agency reported that hospital social  		workers, who are responsible for coordinating hospital discharge to home, may  		not be well informed about the patients' conditions and needs. Participants at  		two of the focus groups suggested that patients often are discharged without  		proper self-care instructions and are not prepared to be at home.</p>
<h4>2. Patient Education</h4>
<p> According to the focus group participants, patient education is an  		important part of home health care. Nurses from six of the eight agencies  		confirmed that patient education has become increasingly important,  		particularly education concerning medication management. The problem-oriented  		teaching that is necessary for complex patients is especially detailed and  		time-consuming. Despite the increase in the importance of education,  		participants suggested that their ability to provide adequate and appropriate  		teaching has declined in recent years. As stated previously, participants  		indicated that they are attempting to teach patients with increasingly complex  		needs in a shorter period of time than in years past. Nurses at one agency  		suggested that insurance companies (including Medicare HMOs) do not allow home  		care for the duration necessary for nurses to provide instruction about complex  		conditions and treatment regimens. Historically, nurses often repeated their  		teachings to ensure that patients gained a full understanding of the  		information provided. However, because of shortened episode lengths, nurses  		reported that they must try to educate their patients quickly, often teaching  		the entire disease process in a single visit. </p>
<p> The focus group participants suggested that hospitals also struggle to  		educate their patients. One nurse suggested that even a normal,  		non-hospitalized person requires teaching up to six times before information is  		retained. In some situations, a patient's hospital discharge occurs before he  		or she is able to remember all that was taught. One nurse noted that hospitals  		are trying to do a better job of educating patients, but that some patients are  		still missed.</p>
<p> The focus group participants had particularly strong sentiments  		regarding the teaching of elderly patients. Many noted that it can be  		especially difficult for elderly patients, as well as their often elderly  		caregivers, to learn and retain information about complex medical conditions,  		medications, and treatment regimens. One participant expressed great  		frustration with the need to educate patients quickly by saying, "Giving a  		compromised senior citizen a dissertation on their disease in one sitting,  		asking if they understand and documenting they verbalized understanding....they  		don't even know what they had for breakfast."</p>
<h4>3. Caregiver Education</h4>
<p> All participants reported that the involvement and education of family  		caregivers is an important focus of their practice. Participants noted that  		family members try to help elderly home care patients, but that they often are  		busy and may not be available or able to learn about the patients' conditions  		and needs. Even when family members are available, some patients do not want to  		rely on their families for assistance.</p>
<p> The focus group participants suggested that they often do not have  		enough time to get to know and instruct patients' family members, especially in  		the cases of more complicated patients. Participants believe that payers do not  		allow them the number of visits they need to teach caregivers, who are often  		elderly themselves, how to manage technically difficult wound care and  		complicated IV therapies that may have potentially serious side effects. The  		need to educate caregivers quickly about complicated treatment regimens was  		equated by one nurse with elder abuse. Other nurses provided examples of cases  		in which they felt they did not have enough time to educate caregivers  		properly. One nurse spoke of an 85 year old woman who had to be taught how to  		manage her husband's IV therapy. Another nurse recounted the story of having to  		teach an elderly woman how to administer adrenaline in the event that her  		spouse had a reaction to his intravenous antibiotic. Several nurses emphasized  		that some patients are themselves caregivers for other ill family members. With  		regard to hypothetical patient vignette #2 (Mr. Lucas), it was suggested that  		diabetic ulcers rarely heal in 45 days and nurses would have to get families  		involved immediately. (The patient vignettes discussed at the focus groups are  		presented in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.) The family would be told at  		the admission visit that they must find someone willing and able to take over  		the wound care as soon as possible.</p>
<h4>4. Goals of Care</h4>
<p> Nurses from all of the agencies reported changes in the goals of care.  		Participants described how case mix, payer source, reductions in staff, and  		documentation requirements have shifted the focus of care. Many felt that  		paperwork has overshadowed patient goals. Nurses from all agencies were  		outspoken that the goal of care is to "get in and get out," especially if a  		patient is considered stable. One nurse even suggested that it "seems like  		we're pushed to say someone is stable."</p>
<p> Many providers are initiating more services at the time of admission  		than in the past for the purpose of identifying ancillary services to provide  		for their patients' needs. Visits are increased early in an episode in an  		effort to get all services the patient needs in place, especially medication  		management education. The underlying goal is to promote the transition out of  		home care. If home health aide services are needed, the goal is to move the  		patient to community programs, waiver programs, or private pay as quickly as  		possible. Families become involved early in care planning and care provision  		activities in order to promote a quick transition out of home care. Families  		are warned that the patients' nurses will be available only for a short time  		and that other caregivers will have to help the patient.</p>
<p> Some participants felt that financial concerns have become a more  		important factor in home care than patient goals. As one participant stated,  		"You work hard to get clients taken care of because the money's going to be cut  		off fast. It's cut off anyway, well or not, dead or alive." Focus group  		participants at one agency felt relieved to have state waiver programs to which  		they can refer patients. For them, transfer to waiver programs is a common  		goal. At other agencies, discharge to community resources or private pay is the  		goal.</p>
<p> When examining Mrs. Smith's case, participants stated that discharge  		planning would begin immediately upon admission. This planning would involve  		trying to find someone other than home care providers to help with the  		patient's needs. Participants suggested that they would only attempt to address  		Mrs. Smith's major acute problems. "The goal is to have the patient be well and  		independent. The longer you're in there, the more dependent they become."</p>
<p> Some nurses reported that, in the past, patients such as hypothetical  		patient Mr. Lucas often received home care for more than two years. Diabetic  		goals of care were to draw fasting blood glucose levels, pre-fill insulin  		syringes weekly, check morning glucose monitoring, and administer insulin. The  		goal of care was to maintain the patient, keeping him or her stable and out of  		the hospital. Nurse visits continued and were justified until the patient's  		wounds were healed and did not recur. The presence of a willing and able family  		member (or other caregiver) often influenced the frequency of the services  		provided in the home. Nurses indicated that there has been a shift in the  		treatment of patients such as Mr. Lucas. The goal of care now focuses to a  		greater degree on increasing family involvement and coordinating alternative  		resources to assist the patient to become independent and ready for  		discharge.</p>
<h4>5. Quality of Care</h4>
<p> Participants perceived a change in the quality of home care. They  		stated that quality of care increasingly is influenced by non-medical people  		(e.g., insurance company personnel). Participants expressed frustration that  		people without clinical experience often are in a position to provide home care  		agencies with rules and guidelines for patient care. According to the focus  		group participants, managed care case managers often rely on information  		gleaned from voice messages and phone conversations to make decisions about  		authorizing visits. Participants felt that home health quality of care has been  		negatively affected by such procedures.</p>
<p> Many of the focus group participants suggested that ongoing home care  		could prevent costly hospitalizations. Many of these nurses believe that agency  		and regulatory factors often require nurses to discharge patients before they  		are ready. Premature discharge, they believe, contributes to a cycle of  		rehospitalizations and readmission to home care. The participants reported  		feeling helpless, that their hands are tied.</p>
<p> Participants also felt that they are unable to spend enough time with  		patients and families due to financial pressures. One participant stated, "You  		don't have time to help them, you're rushing people. Dollars have changed.  		Medicare has gotten so strict, it's very unusual for anyone to recertify. It's  		a colder environment and worse for seniors." </p>
<p> At one agency, the focus group participants were nurse specialists with  		advanced education/certification in the care of CHF patients. These nurses  		reported that their productivity requirements have increased dramatically and  		that their patient visits have become more complicated. Further, they reported  		that they must now accomplish more in fewer visits, and that their patients  		have little opportunity to receive the quality of care these specialists are  		capable of providing.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVID" id="chapVID">D. Case Study Interviews</a></h3>
<p> To obtain provider perspectives on changes that have occurred in home  		health care as a result of federal policy changes, the case study nurses were  		asked to identify how the practice of home care has changed in their agencies  		as a result of new federal policies and regulations, such as the implementation  		of IPS.<sup><font><a href="#note49">49</a></font></sup> The case  		study nurses perceived several changes in the practice of home care (see  		<a href="#table6.2">Table 6.2</a>). Generally, these direct care nurses tended  		to have little exposure to the financial and policy aspects of home care, and  		therefore often were unable to identify the causes of these changes. When  		nurses specifically tied these changes to federal policies, this is  		indicated.</p>
<p> The case study nurses identified a number of ways in which the practice  		of home care at their agencies has changed in recent years. Two nurses  		indicated that their agencies have instituted cost saving measures. One agency  		has closed branch offices, discontinued incentive and yearly bonuses, cut the  		mileage reimbursement rate, and increased nurse productivity standards. This  		nurse indicated that her agency had been preparing for IPS for the past three  		years and had been losing money for several years. She reported that "It has  		been a very difficult last three years with all the downsizing and rearranging.  		Changes, changes, changes. We are all saying prayers." Another agency has  		developed a case management system for tracking patient costs as a result of  		IPS. When patients are referred to this agency, a case manager estimates how  		much the patient will cost the agency. If the cost is over a certain "goal"  		value, the agency may refuse the patient.</p>

</tr></table><p> Nurses noted a number of changes to home care nursing. Although nurses  		from two agencies indicated that the services provided to patients have not  		changed since IPS went into effect, a nurse from another agency indicated that  		patients are provided with less nursing care than they once were. Two nurses  		commented on the increase in the paperwork they must complete for each patient.  		When asked what they spent the most time doing when they were working on these  		cases outside of the patients' homes, three additional nurses indicated that  		they spent most of their time completing paperwork and documenting the cases.  		Three nurses suggested that the changes in home care have placed increased  		pressure on agency nurses. One nurse noted that the "hurry to discharge"  		patients leaves nurses feeling uncertain about their patients' readiness for  		discharge. Nurses are left wondering "was I too hasty?" Two nurses suggested  		that the need for more thorough documentation of patient cases puts pressure on  		the primary care nurses. One nurse noted that the new federal policies "are  		probably more cost-effective, but definitely double the paperwork and double  		the stress." Another nurse noted that "it makes [her] nervous to think that  		what [she] writes in the notes will determine whether the agency will get paid"  		for her services. Two nurses also noted that home care nurses spend more time  		than in the past requesting needed services from HMOs and Medicare. One of  		these nurses lamented that home care nurses can no longer "just talk to the  		doctor and go from there."</p>
<p> A few of the case study nurses commented on changes in agency personnel  		in the recent past. Nurses from two agencies indicated that there have been  		lay-offs at their agencies. In one case, a large number of administrative and  		an entire level of management staff have been fired. The nurse commented that  		this agency is trying to "cut costs without affecting patient care." At one  		agency, all LPNs have been laid off. A nurse from another agency indicated that  		there has been a substantial decrease in the availability of home health aides  		at her agency. Sometimes, patients do not receive the aide services they need  		because of this shortage. One nurse reported that many nurses are leaving home  		care and taking positions in hospital settings. She suggested that these nurses  		have left home care because "the paperwork is phenomenal."</p>
<p> Five of the seven case study nurses commented on the extent to which  		coverage issues are considered in the process of making decisions about patient  		care. Nurses from three agencies indicated that coverage rules do not enter  		into decisions about patient care. One of these nurses reported that she is  		"pleased to say that [her] agency's policy is to provide for the patients'  		needs whether or not it goes over the limits." She suggested that her  		supervisors "probably think about the money issues a lot more than [she] does,"  		but that she has not been made to feel that she has to consider finances when  		she makes decisions about a patient's care. She noted that she would "love to  		not ever have to think about finances at all." Nurses from two other agencies  		indicated that coverage is an important factor considered in decision making  		about patient care. Two nurses felt that some patients are discharged from home  		care sooner than they should be.</p>
<p> The case study nurses reported several changes to patient care in their  		agencies. Nurses from three agencies reported that substantially fewer patients  		are recertified in their agencies than in earlier years. Frequently, nurses  		expressed that they have been told that they have to "get in and get out" of  		patients' homes. In addition, four of the seven case study nurses indicated  		that their agencies often turn away certain types of patients. Two agencies  		frequently refuse high-need patients. Although the agencies do not have  		hard-and-fast rules about refusing these cases, the nurses indicated that their  		agencies often will not take patients needing daily aide or nursing services,  		patients with high estimated costs, diabetic patients, or wound care patients.  		Nurses from two agencies noted that their agencies are no longer able to care  		for patients who need only infrequent nursing care. Nurses from three agencies  		indicated that their agencies do not refuse any kinds of patients. A nurse from  		one of these agencies qualified this statement, reporting that her agency does  		not refuse any patients, provided they are teachable or have teachable  		caregivers.</p>
<p> Four case study nurses suggested that Medicare patients have been  		affected negatively by recent changes in home health care. Two nurses believe  		that the venipuncture regulation represents a difficult "double bind" for  		patients. These nurses noted that, although many elderly patients have  		difficulty getting to the hospital or doctor's office, they no longer are able  		to have necessary labs drawn at home. These comments may reflect a fundamental  		misunderstanding of Medicare coverage rules (i.e., venipuncture is a covered  		service for patients who are in need of skilled nursing care). Some nurses  		commented that restrictions on home care services may be resulting in patients  		being discharged before they should be or in patients being relegated to  		nursing homes when they may not need this level of care. One nurse commented  		that she thinks "it is very unfair that people work all their lives and when  		they need care, they are shoved to the side because someone has told us that we  		need to get in and get out." Two nurses indicated that the lack of Medicare  		coverage for medications represents a hardship for patients. One nurse  		suggested that, without supplemental insurance, many patients are unable to get  		the medications they need. Another nurse wondered how long patients will take  		medications that they must pay for themselves. In discussing recent changes to  		the home health industry, one nurse suggested that "it makes [her] fear getting  		old."</p>
<p> The case study nurses frequently commented on a general sense of  		mistrust between home health payers and providers. Although the nurses  		understand the need to eradicate abuse in the industry, they perceive that  		payers do not trust home care providers. One nurse commented, "we <em>really  		do</em> work in home health," referring to her sense that policymakers have a  		perception to the contrary. The case study nurses also expressed concern that  		the payers do not have a clear understanding of all of the issues involved in  		caring for elderly patients in their homes. One nurse wondered if "policymakers  		[are] just out of touch with elderly people and their obstacles." A number of  		nurses suggested that agencies that fund home health care do not understand how  		critical the education component of home care is and how difficult it can be to  		teach elderly patients complex information about their conditions and  		treatments. Case study nurses also expressed concern about the motives of  		payers. One nurse mentioned that she had heard that HMOs give bonuses to their  		case managers for refusing services. Another nurse commented that she is "not  		sure which is worse anymore, HMOs or Medicare." HMOs pay for medications, but  		the patients and their nurses have little control over the care provided. </p>
<h2><a name="chapVII" id="chapVII">VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p> The Study of Medicare Home Health Practice Variations was designed to  		examine the following key study questions:</p>
<ol><li>What is the actual practice of home health care, in terms of type,  		  amount, and decision making (e.g., care planning, care coordination)? </li>
<li>How are decisions about care made in light of Medicare coverage  		  rules?</li>
<li>What elements of practice are associated with long lengths of stay in  		  the Medicare home health benefit?</li>
</ol><p>In addition, although the project was not initially intended to explore  		the impact of recent policy changes on the field of home health care, the  		timing of the study allowed for an examination of provider perspectives on  		regulatory changes in home health care. </p>
<p> This final report summarizes the findings from the quantitative and  		qualitative methods used to answer the key study questions. Specifically, the  		report summarizes the study methods and sample, explores the causes of practice  		variations in home health care, examines the relationship between practices and  		patient outcome, summarizes qualitative findings regarding practice and  		decision making in home health care, and explores provider perspectives on the  		changes in home health care resulting primarily from the implementation of the  		Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVIIA" id="chapVIIA">A. Practice and Decision Making in  		Home Health Care</a></h3>
<h4>1. Quantitative Findings</h4>
<p> Quantitative analyses were conducted on longitudinal data to examine  		(1) the effect of patient, provider, agency, and market/regulatory factors on  		home care practices, (2) the influence of practice patterns on episode length,  		and (3) the impact of home care practices on patient outcome. Five important  		aspects of home health practice, covering both direct care provision and care  		coordination, were selected for examination. The four measures of direct care  		investigated were (1) the average number of visits provided to a patient per  		day (i.e., visit intensity), (2) the duration of the home health episode  		(length of stay), (3) the total number of disciplines involved in patient care,  		and (4) the number of alternative services provided during the episode of  		care.<sup><font><a href="#note50">50</a></font></sup> The amount of  		feedback received by the primary home care provider from other agency personnel  		regarding a patient's care plan and discharge was examined as a measure of care  		coordination.<sup><font><a href="#note51">51</a></font></sup></p>
<p>	<i><strong>Effect of Patient, Provider, Agency, and Market/Regulatory  		Factors on Practice Patterns</strong></i>: Results of the multivariate analyses  		reported in <a href="#chapIV"> Chapter 4</a> suggest that home care practice  		under IPS was heavily influenced by patient condition, as it should be. Patient  		complexity, functional status, and diagnoses were important predictors of the  		practice pattern measures of frequency of visits a patient would receive, the  		number of disciplines and alternative services that would be included in the  		patient's care, the patient's length of stay, and the amount of feedback a care  		provider would receive from other agency personnel about the patient. </p>
<p> Factors other than patient condition, however, also impacted home care  		practices. Although care provider characteristics were not extremely important  		statistically, they did have some effect on practice patterns. Notably, even  		after controlling for patient characteristics, care providers with many years  		of experience in home health care tended to have patients with significantly  		longer episode lengths than did less experienced providers. It appears that  		these providers, having been in home health care prior to the implementation of  		the BBA, may have experienced more difficulty adjusting to a new era  		characterized by significant constraints on the cost and utilization of  		Medicare home health care services. </p>
<p> Despite the implementation of BBA regulations to curb home health  		spending and to reduce unnecessary variations in practice patterns, it appears  		that such variations may still exist. After controlling for patient, provider,  		market/regulatory, and other agency factors, agency ownership and type were  		strong predictors of home care practices. Proprietary agencies appeared to  		counterbalance visit intensity and length of stay, providing their patients  		with more frequent visits over shorter episodes than did nonproprietary  		agencies. These agencies also made greater use of alternative services in the  		community, perhaps attempting to reduce agency costs by outsourcing the care  		for some of their patient's needs.</p>
<p> Freestanding agencies appeared to be higher utilizers than their  		hospital-based counterparts. After controlling for patient case mix, as well as  		provider, market/regulatory, and other agency factors, freestanding agencies  		provided both more frequent visits and longer episodes of care than did  		hospital-based agencies. These findings are consistent with previous research  		indicating that freestanding agencies experienced greater hardship in  		attempting to adjust to the demands of IPS (GAO 1999). Freestanding agencies  		were more likely than hospital-based agencies to close during the IPS period.  		</p>
<p> Variation in practices continued to follow state-level patterns. In  		this study, states that had been identified based on 1995 data as providing a  		large number of home care visits per patient appeared to continue to utilize  		home care resources more heavily than did states with lower visit volume.  		Specifically, after controlling for patient factors, episodes occurring in  		high-volume states involved significantly more frequent visits and more  		disciplines than those occurring in low-volume states. Holding patient and  		other factors constant, it appears that certain states continue to provide a  		setting in which high utilization of home health resources is the norm.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Effect of Practice Patterns on Episode Length</strong></i>:  		Controlling for patient case mix, as well as important provider, agency, and  		market/regulatory factors, visit intensity and the number of disciplines  		involved in patient care both were associated with the length of a patient's  		home health episode. Agencies appeared to counterbalance frequency of visits  		and length of stay, such that episodes involving more frequent visits were  		significantly shorter than episodes with less frequent visits. Episodes of care  		that involved more disciplines were significantly longer than those involving  		fewer home health disciplines, even after controlling for patient, provider,  		agency, and market/regulatory factors.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Effect of Practice Patterns on Patient Outcome</strong></i>:  		The practice patterns examined in this study were not strong predictors of  		patient outcome. Of particular interest was the relationship between visit  		intensity and patient outcome. After controlling for patient, provider, agency,  		and market/regulatory factors, and other practice patterns, patients receiving  		more frequent visits experienced marginally better outcomes of home care than  		did patients with less frequent visits. Length of stay, however, did not  		predict patient outcome. It is possible that frequent visits allow care  		providers to monitor a patient's condition more carefully and thus provide that  		patient with care that is more timely and is based on a clearer understanding  		of the patient's needs. </p>
<h4>2. Qualitative Findings</h4>
<p> The focus group and case study interviews were designed to identify the  		actual practice of home health care and to examine how decisions about care are  		made in light of Medicare coverage rules. In this section, key findings from  		the focus group and case study interviews related to the actual practice of  		home health care are discussed. Information regarding Medicare coverage rules  		is discussed in Section C below. The findings both augment and extend into  		areas beyond those covered by the quantitative analyses. All information was  		gathered during the IPS period.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Services Provided</strong></i>: Medicare home health care  		involves skilled nursing; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; medical  		social work; and aide services. Nurses are the central providers in the home  		health care system. The primary responsibilities of the home care nurses are to  		assess the patients' medical condition and needs, and to educate the patient  		and family about the patients' illnesses and treatment regimens. A patient's  		primary nurse also plays an important role in determining a patient's care plan  		(e.g., frequency of visits, disciplines involved), managing the patient's  		medications, completing required forms, documenting the patient's case,  		organizing a support network for the patient, performing psychological  		counseling, and ensuring that care providers from different disciplines are "on  		the same page."</p>
<p> Care providers from other disciplines provide important services for  		patients in home health care. Physical therapy is provided to help the patients  		improve their strength and balance. Primary nurses often do not order physical  		therapy for patients they consider too unmotivated to benefit from these  		services. The primary role of medical social workers is to identify community  		resources and to assist home care patients with their psychological needs.  		Importantly, two of three case study patients for which a social work  		consultation was requested refused to accept these services, leaving the  		primary nurses in the position of having to provide these services themselves.  		Home health aides assist patients with showering, skin care, meal preparation,  		cleaning, laundry, and shopping. Aides also remind the patients to take their  		medications, monitor the patients' weights, and report changes in the patients'  		conditions immediately to the primary nurses. Three case study patients refused  		aide services.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Factors Affecting Services Provided</strong></i>: The nurses  		participating in the focus group and case study interviews identified a number  		of factors affecting services provided to Medicare home care beneficiaries.  		According to focus group participants, patients just released from the hospital  		often are sicker than other home care recipients and frequently require complex  		or high-tech services. These complex cases involve more vigilant attention from  		the nurses, as well as more frequent communication between disciplines, and  		documentation that is more excessive.</p>
<p> Although the family support network is important for all recipients of  		home health care, a number of the focus group and case study participants noted  		the special importance of family members for elderly home care recipients.  		Patients may have great difficulty caring for themselves and may need  		assistance in multiple domains of their daily lives. Focus group participants  		indicated that they consider the availability of caregivers in their decisions  		to recertify or discharge patients. Family members of the case study patients  		commonly provided assistance with ADLs, IADLs, medication management, and were  		frequently involved directly in the patients' care (e.g., accepting or refusing  		services, attending nursing visits, weighing the patients). Interview  		participants emphasized that some home care patients are cared for by spouses  		or other family members who may be as old and frail as the patients themselves.  		</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Care Planning and Coordination</strong></i>: Substantial  		variation in the process of care planning and coordination was found among  		agencies in both the focus groups and case studies. The role of the primary  		nurse in the process of developing the patient's care plan varied from agency  		to agency. At some of the case study agencies, nurses reported that they have a  		great deal of control over a patient's care plan. Although the referring  		physician must approve the care plan at all agencies, several nurses indicated  		that the primary nurse develops the care plan and writes the orders. The  		physician simply approves the nurse's plan.</p>
<p> According to a number of focus group and case study participants, many  		agencies involve supervisors in the development of patients' care plans. They  		either approve the plans laid out by the primary nurses or worked with the  		primary nurses to jointly develop the plan. Although not definitive due to  		small sample size, the case study interviews suggested that primary nurses have  		greater control over the development of their patients' care plans in  		low-volume states and in non-proprietary agencies.</p>
<p> Communication among care providers appears to be fairly consistent  		across agencies. The focus group participants indicated that the process of  		coordinating care for patients begins immediately at the start of care. The  		case study nurses reported that they generally communicate with their patients'  		physicians only at milestone time points in the episodes of care. Nurses  		communicate with physicians at the start of care and as the patient approaches  		recertification or discharge. In between these time points, nurses tend to  		contact the physicians only when changes occur in a patient's condition or  		treatment plan. Contact with physicians is nearly always made indirectly  		through the physician's nursing staff. </p>
<p> Communication between the primary nurses and other care providers is  		fairly regular. The case study nurses reported being in contact with their  		patients' aides at least weekly. In addition, the nurses made home visits with  		the aides every two weeks. The nurses also indicated that the aides frequently  		call with questions or new information about a patient.</p>
<p> Case conferences are an important mechanism through which care  		providers of different disciplines stay in contact regarding their patients.  		Most of the case study nurses who coordinated other disciplines on behalf of  		their patients were in contact with those other providers at case conferences.  		Generally, patients are presented at conferences at the start of care,  		recertification, discharge, and when problems arise. In addition, therapists  		and social workers generally contact the primary nurse once they have developed  		their own care plans for a patient. </p>
<p> Discharge planning begins very early in the home care episode, usually  		at the first visit. Nurses cited a number of factors that they consider in  		determining a patient's readiness for discharge: patient is medically stable,  		the educational goals have been reached, the patient is no longer homebound,  		services will no longer be covered by Medicare, the patient's medication  		regimen has been stabilized, the patient has increased endurance, and the  		patient is able to manage his or her medications.</p>
<p> Nurses engage in a variety of activities in planning for a patient's  		discharge. Most commonly, nurses make arrangements for the patient's continuing  		needs to be met after discharge (e.g., identify resources to assist with  		transportation, meal preparation). Communicating with other care providers  		through case conferencing and other methods of interaction is an important  		component of the discharge-planning process. </p>
<h3><a name="chapVIIB" id="chapVIIB">B. Provider Perspectives on the  		Interim Payment System (IPS) and Changes in Home Health Care</a></h3>
<p> This study was not originally intended to examine the impact of recent  		regulatory changes related to home health care. However, since the 1997 BBA was  		implemented prior to the major data acquisition phase of the project, it was  		possible to investigate provider perspectives on the impact of the provisions  		of the BBA and other regulatory changes during the IPS period on home health  		care. Four qualitative methods were used to explore provider perspectives on  		IPS and other changes in home health care. The impact of these regulatory  		changes was examined through (1) interviews with administrators of the study  		agencies, (2) interviews with representatives of home care associations in each  		of the eight study states, as well as (3) focus groups, and (4) case study  		interviews with home health care nurses at the study agencies. These methods  		provided valuable qualitative information regarding the effects of IPS and  		related policy changes on home health care. This information can serve as a  		baseline against which home health practices under PPS can be compared in the  		future. </p>
<p> It is important to note that the data gathered through these methods  		were not based on a random sample of home care providers, administrators, and  		state association representatives. Therefore, the information that this sample  		of participants provided with regard to the impact that the BBA had (prior to  		the implementation of PPS) on their states and their agencies may not be an  		accurate reflection of the impact that the BBA had on home health care  		nationwide. Further, these individuals may not have been fully aware of the  		provisions of the BBA and probably were not unbiased toward federal policies  		and regulations designed to restrict the growth of home health utilization.</p>
<p> Several important themes emerged across the four methods used to  		examine provider perceptions of IPS and concurrent regulatory changes.  		Participants in the focus group, case study, and state home care association  		interviews reported that home care providers were more restricted in the  		services they were able to offer to their patients under IPS than prior to IPS.  		In addition, many participants suggested that patients were on service for  		shorter periods of time than they once were and that some patients were  		discharged before they should be. The pressure to discharge patients quickly  		led to the identification and involvement of community and other outside  		resources early in patients' episodes of care. According to agency  		administrators, this increased emphasis on community resources resulted in the  		expansion of the role of social workers in patient care. </p>
<p> Participants involved in all four of the interview methods reported  		that some agencies had begun to refuse high-need patients, such as chronic,  		complex, or rural patients in an attempt to avoid expensive patients whose care  		needs might substantially exceed the agencies' per-beneficiary limits. Most  		commonly, participants suggested that access to home care services had been  		reduced for diabetic patients and patients who needed daily wound care. These  		data suggest that some high-need patients may have experienced reduced access  		to home health care as a result of the increasingly stringent admissions  		practices of some home care agencies under IPS.</p>
<p> Participants in the administrator, focus group, and case study  		interviews suggested that education had become an increasingly important aspect  		of home care. Patients and their families were required to develop an  		understanding of the patients' conditions and needs and to provide for those  		needs themselves. Interview participants noted that this education had to take  		place in an increasingly short period of time, as nurses often were told to  		"get in and get out" of their patients' homes. Several focus group and case  		study nurses suggested that policymakers did not understand how difficult it  		was to teach an elderly patient or an elderly spouse the things they needed to  		know to take over the services that agency personnel provide. </p>
<p> Changes occurred at the agency level as well. Interview participants  		noted that many home care agencies in their states had closed or merged with  		other agencies. Other agencies had instituted cost-saving measures, laid off  		staff, reduced staff benefits, and instituted additional case management  		procedures. Agencies had increased nurse productivity standards, were providing  		less nursing care overall, and had changed their geographic service areas in an  		attempt to respond to the pressures imposed by IPS and other regulatory  		changes. A number of participants noted that many nurses had left home care and  		that there was a shortage of home health aides, circumstances that often  		impacted patient care. According to agency administrators, even when aides were  		available, fewer aide visits were provided than once were. Participants in the  		state home care association and administrator interviews agreed that many  		agencies were pursuing ways to diversify their payer sources, seeking to shift  		their case mix more toward Medicaid and managed care and away from Medicare.  		Agency administrators also noted a reduction in physician referrals to home  		care.</p>
<p> Other studies designed to assess the impact of BBA provisions, IPS in  		particular, corroborate many of this study's findings. In the current study,  		agency representatives reported reducing the level of services and the number  		of visits provided to their patients, as well as reducing the duration of their  		patients' episodes of care. Similarly, in a report prepared for the Medicare  		Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), Abt Associates (1999) reported that 71%  		of agencies surveyed had decreased the number of visits provided to Medicare  		patients. Proprietary agencies (76%) and agencies of medium to large size (more  		than 75%) were most likely to have reduced the number of visits they provide.  		Smith, Maloy, and Hawkins (1999) also reported a reduction in the level of  		services provided, the number of visits provided, and a reduction in the length  		of stabilization periods for home care patients. These effects may be a result  		of IPS, as well as agencies' more careful determination that patients were only  		on service so long as they meet Medicare eligibility criteria.</p>
<p> In the current study, many interview participants reported that  		agencies had changed the mix of visit types provided to their patients.  		Specifically, they suggested that patients received fewer aide visits and less  		nursing care than they did prior to the implementation of IPS and other  		changes, but that social workers were more likely to be involved in patient  		care than they once were. These findings were only partially corroborated by  		other research. As in the current study, the Abt Associates study (1999)  		indicated that many agencies provided fewer aide visits (28.1%) than they once  		did. Further, 14.5% of agencies surveyed provided less skilled nursing care  		than they did prior to IPS. Representatives of 8.4% of agencies, however,  		reported providing more skilled nursing care under IPS. The additional 77.1% of  		the agencies reported no change in the provision of skilled nursing care.  		Contrary to the current study's findings, the MedPAC report prepared by Abt  		Associates (1999) suggested that social workers may, in fact, have been less  		involved in patient care than they once were. In that study, more agency  		representatives reported decreasing (8.4%) than increasing (4.2%) the  		involvement of social workers. However, most agencies (87.4%) made no changes  		in their utilization of social work services.</p>
<p> Some interview participants in the current study reported that home  		care agencies were actively seeking to change their case mix by reducing the  		number of Medicare patients they served. Likewise, in 1999, Abt Associates  		reported that more than half of the 1,054 agencies at which interviews were  		conducted experienced a decline in their Medicare caseload following the  		implementation of IPS. Proprietary agencies and VNAs were most likely to report  		declines in their Medicare caseload. Smith and her colleagues (1999) reported a  		21% decline in the number of Medicare beneficiaries admitted to the home care  		agencies involved in their study under IPS. However, a report from the GAO  		(1998) suggested that the shift away from Medicare patients may not have been  		universal. In that study, more than half of the hospital discharge planners and  		many of the representatives of local aging organizations that were interviewed  		had not seen a reduction in the willingness or ability of home health agencies  		in their states to accept Medicare patients.</p>
<p> Participants in the administrator interviews, state home care  		association interviews, focus group interviews, and case study interviews  		suggested that some agencies had begun to screen patients more selectively at  		admission to maintain a desired case mix. A number of other studies support  		this finding (Abt Associates 1999; GAO 1998; GAO 1999; MedPAC 2000; OIG 1999a;  		Smith et al. 1999). In 1999, Abt Associates reported that 38.9% of home care  		agency representatives interviewed indicated that, as a result of IPS, certain  		types of patients were no longer admitted to their agencies. Agency control,  		size, and reimbursement appeared to influence the likelihood that an agency  		would turn away a potential patient. Representatives of 52% of the proprietary  		agencies reported not admitting certain patients, compared with 30% of the  		representatives of VNAs and government agencies. Representatives of smaller  		agencies were more likely to report IPS-related refusals compared with those of  		larger agencies. In addition, a greater proportion of agencies expecting to  		exceed their per-beneficiary limits or per-visit limits refused to admit  		certain types of patients than did agencies that were not expecting to exceed  		these limits (per-beneficiary limits: 47% vs. 33%; per-visit limits: 45% vs.  		31%). </p>
<p> As suggested in the current study, other studies provided evidence that  		particular types of patients may have experienced reduced access to home health  		care as a result of agencies' more stringent admission practices. Although 85%  		of hospital discharge planners interviewed as part of an OIG study (1999a)  		reported that Medicare patients had access to home health care when they needed  		it, more than half of those interviewed reported that certain kinds of patients  		had become more difficult to place (i.e., those needing care for chronic  		illnesses or Alzheimer's/dementia, IV care, high-cost care, intensive care, or  		dialysis). In 1998, GAO concluded that, overall, IPS had not had a negative  		impact on Medicare beneficiaries' access to home health care. However, hospital  		discharge planners and representatives of local organizations for the aged who  		participated in that study reported that beneficiaries who were likely to be  		expensive were more difficult to place than were other types of patients. In a  		1999 report, GAO noted that some agencies were reluctant to admit wound  		patients and diabetics unable to self-administer insulin. In addition,  		representatives of national advocacy groups and Area Agencies on Aging  		interviewed reported having received complaints about a lack of access for  		patients with chronic illness, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis,  		quadriplegia, and long-term care needs. Approximately two-thirds of discharge  		planners and more than one-third of organization representatives reported  		having difficulty placing patients with intensive skilled nursing needs and  		patients needing large numbers of visits and long episodes of care. Abt  		Associates (1999) reported that patients with long-term care needs or chronic  		disease, diabetes or wound care patients, and patients with expensive care  		needs were most commonly mentioned by agency representatives as patients who  		might no longer be admitted to their home care agencies. In their interviews  		with agency representatives, Smith and her colleagues (1999) also found that  		patients who required high-cost treatments, intensive skilled nursing care,  		frequent visits, or long episodes of care may have experienced reduced access  		to home health care. On the other hand, low-cost patients may actually have  		experienced improved access to care as a result of IPS-related incentives to  		reduce per-patient costs.<sup><font><a href="#note52">52</a></font></sup> Many agencies had seen a substantial shift  		away from long-stay and toward short-stay patients in response to IPS.</p>
<p> The possibility of access problems for certain patient types also was  		found in an OIG study (OIG 2000) that examined Medicare claims data for the top  		12 diagnosis related groups (DRGs) discharged to home care. For only one of  		these DRGs was there a substantial decrease between the pre- and post-IPS  		periods in the percentage of hospital patients admitted to home care (DRG 106,  		coronary bypass). However, it is important to note that the OIG report did not  		examine the DRGs used to categorize patients with primary diagnoses of diabetes  		mellitus (i.e., DRGs 294 and 295). Since many reports have suggested that  		diabetes patients might have experienced a reduction in access to home health  		care, it would be informative to examine the impact of IPS on home health  		access for these DRGs directly.<sup><font><a href="#note53">53</a></font></sup></p>
<p> Participants in the current study reported many agency-level changes  		related to IPS and other policy changes. Many participants reported that their  		agencies had laid off staff and reduced staff benefits. Similarly, Abt  		Associates (1999) reported that 75% of agencies had reduced their staff or  		staff hours. Proprietary agencies (82%), large agencies (86%), and agencies  		expecting to exceed their per-beneficiary limits (83%) and per-visit limits  		(80%) were more likely than other agencies to have reduced the size of their  		staffs overall. Smith and her colleagues (1999) also reported significant  		staffing changes as a result of IPS. Between 1994 and 1999, skilled nursing  		staff had been reduced by 23% and aide staff had been reduced by 43%.  		Administrative staff also had been cut dramatically (Abt Associates 1999; Smith  		et al. 1999). Clinical staff had seen increased administrative responsibility  		as a result of the reductions in the size of agencies' administrative staffs  		(Smith et al. 1999). As in the current study, Abt Associates (1999) reported  		that many agencies (55%) had reduced staff benefits.</p>
<p> The current study suggests that under IPS, agencies had developed a  		greater focus on efficiency. Agencies had instituted more careful case  		management and supervisory procedures, and had increased their focus on patient  		independence as a result of IPS. Nurses in the focus groups and case studies  		commented on the increased role of nursing supervisors, multidisciplinary team  		conferences, and other oversight mechanisms in the decision-making process in  		home health care. Nurses emphasized the increasing importance of education in  		home health care as a means of enabling patients and/or their caregivers to  		become capable of providing for the patients' needs independently. Smith et al.  		(1999) also reported these changes in agency practice. As a result of IPS,  		agencies in that study began to make greater use of case managers and to focus  		more extensively on the goal of patient independence than they had in the  		pre-IPS period. GAO (1999) also found that agencies attempted to educate  		patients earlier in the episodes of care than they once had.</p>
<p> Many interview participants in the current study commented on the  		closure of home care agencies or branch offices as a result of regulatory  		changes affecting home health care (e.g., IPS, ORT). Between October 1, 1997,  		when IPS was implemented, and January 1, 1999, 14% of home care agencies closed  		their doors (GAO 1999). However, some studies suggested that these closures  		might have been a market correction following a period of tremendous growth in  		the number of home health care agencies. Many of these agency closures had  		occurred in states that had the largest growth in the number of agencies and  		high utilization rates prior to the implementation of IPS (GAO 1999). Further,  		the agencies that closed following the implementation of IPS were similar in  		many ways to the agencies that opened in the early 1990s, when home health  		utilization grew dramatically. These agencies were disproportionately of  		proprietary control, freestanding, and urban (GAO 1999; Liu, Harvell, Gage  		2000). They also were newer, had smaller Medicare caseloads, and provided 44%  		more visits per beneficiary than did agencies that remained open following the  		implementation of IPS (GAO 1999). In addition to agency closures, Abt  		Associates (1999) reported that 40% of the agencies involved in that survey had  		shut down branch offices in response to IPS. Proprietary agencies (53%) were  		more likely than non-proprietary (31%) and government agencies (22%) to close  		branches. Agencies that were expected to exceed their cost limits were more  		likely than those agencies not expected to exceed their limits to close branch  		offices (per-beneficiary limit: 47% vs. 35%; per-visit limit: 44% vs. 33%).</p>
<p> According to GAO (1999), access to home health care was not negatively  		impacted by agency closures. By 1999, the utilization of home health services  		had declined to 1994 levels. Although 1994 was not the peak of home health  		utilization, it was a period of relatively high utilization. Further, as  		intended, regional variations in the utilization of home health services had  		declined following the implementation of IPS. Most representatives of state  		survey organizations interviewed by GAO indicated that beneficiary access was  		not reduced by agency closures. Even in rural counties that lost their only  		home health agencies, hospital discharge planners and managers of nearby  		agencies reported that beneficiaries were able to obtain care from agencies in  		other counties or branch locations within their own county. Although  		utilization decreased slightly in counties without any home health agencies, it  		remained above the national average.</p>
<p> The current study identified a decline in physician referrals to home  		health care. Similarly, Abt Associates (1999) reported that 77% of agency  		representatives surveyed had noticed a reluctance of physicians to refer  		patients for Medicare home care services. According to Smith and her colleagues  		(1999), changing referral patterns might have been a result of the failure of  		physicians to understand Medicare eligibility criteria. Other physicians no  		longer referred patients to home care out of fear of becoming the target of a  		physician review by their Medicare Fiscal Intermediary (FI). In addition to  		these concerns, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  		(HIPAA), which went into effect in August 1996, likely had been the impetus  		behind some of the reduction in physician referrals. HIPAA established a  		monetary penalty for any physician who falsely certifies the need for  		Medicare-covered home health services.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVIIC" id="chapVIIC">C. Implications</a></h3>
<p> Implications of the study's quantitative and qualitative findings for  		clinical practice guidelines and Medicare home health coverage rules are  		considered in this section. Since the study pertains to the IPS period, it will  		be important for future work to reassess the validity of the implications under  		PPS.</p>
<h4>1. Implications for Clinical Practice Guidelines</h4>
<p> Quantitative analyses confirm that patient factors are predominant in  		predicting practice patterns in home health care. Patient care plans clearly  		are designed largely based on patients' medical conditions and needs. Despite  		an increasing focus on cost of care, agency staffs have maintained their focus  		on providing care tailored to the individual needs of their patients.</p>
<p> It is clear, however, that other factors continue to influence practice  		decisions. Notably, certain characteristics of the care providers, agencies,  		and home care markets influence care planning and provision, regardless of  		patient condition. Care providers with more years of experience in home health  		care do not appear to have adjusted their style of practice to incorporate a  		consideration of cost in addition to a focus on the good of the patient.  		Although length of stay was not found to predict patient outcome, episodes of  		care involving care providers with more years of experience were significantly  		longer than episodes involving less experienced providers (controlling for  		patient, agency, market/regulatory, and other agency factors). This finding  		suggests that more experienced care providers may be continuing to utilize  		services as they had prior to the increase in concern over the cost of home  		health care, but that their higher use of services does not appear to benefit  		their patients. It could be helpful for agencies to educate their care  		providers to a greater extent about concerns related to overutilization of  		care. Emphasizing that patient outcome is the priority, it may be possible to  		encourage providers to incorporate a secondary focus on cost that could reduce  		unnecessary utilization of services without reducing the effectiveness of the  		care provided. Under PPS, financial incentives to reduce utilization are quite  		strong, so this trend may occur naturally. </p>
<p> Agency and market/regulatory factors also influenced practice patterns,  		even after controlling for patient case mix and other important factors. It  		appears that specific types of agencies and specific states provide an  		environment in which high levels of utilization are the norm. Freestanding  		agencies, for example, provide more frequent visits and longer episodes of care  		than their hospital-based counterparts, even after controlling for patient case  		mix. Although more frequent visits were marginally related to more positive  		patient outcome, length of stay was not. It may be that patients treated by  		freestanding agencies receive appropriate visit frequency, while experiencing  		longer than necessary episodes of care.</p>
<p> Likewise, states identified as high utilizers based on 1995 data,  		appeared to maintain this status under IPS. Controlling for patient case mix  		and other factors, agencies in high-volume states provided significantly higher  		visit intensity and involved more disciplines in care. It appears that these  		agencies might be able to reduce their utilization of home health care services  		without diminishing their patients' outcomes of care. Utilization of services  		under PPS should be monitored with regard to patient outcomes.</p>
<p> Analyses examining patient outcome revealed that higher visit intensity  		was marginally related to better patient outcomes. As noted earlier, it is  		possible that more frequent visits, particularly early on in a patient's  		episode of care, may help the patient achieve more positive outcomes. The care  		plan may be more accurate in episodes in which the patient is seen frequently.  		Further, providers are likely to become aware of problems or changes in  		condition very quickly under such circumstances. Although more frequent visits  		have a positive impact on outcome, it does not necessarily follow that frequent  		visits require an increased level of utilization. The quantitative analyses  		suggested that many agencies counterbalance visit intensity with length of  		stay, providing visits more frequently over shorter episodes of care. Further,  		and more importantly, it appears that this pattern may have positive results  		for home care patients. Indeed, proprietary agencies, which provided more  		frequent visits over shorter episodes of care, were found to have significantly  		better patient outcomes than did nonproprietary agencies (see  		<a href="#table4.4">Table 4.4</a>). A focus on visit intensity rather than  		length of stay may be appropriate for some types of patients.</p>
<h4>2. Implications for Medicare Home Health Coverage  		Rules</h4>
<p> The focus groups and case study interviews revealed that a lack of  		clarity regarding home health regulations has a major impact on home health  		practice. Some of the critical concepts of the Medicare coverage rules are  		unclear to many providers. Specifically, nurses involved in the focus group and  		case study interviews referred to the difficulty they and others have  		understanding the concept of "homebound," what constitutes skilled nursing  		care, and what management and evaluation (M&amp;E) is and when it can be used.  		</p>
<p> Focus group and case study nurses alike reported that the definition of  		"homebound," a critical feature of the Medicare coverage rules, is unclear.  		Interview participants suggested that the definition is quite subjective and  		that most home care nurses have their own personal definitions of this concept.  		</p>
<p> Some of the focus group participants indicated that there is  		uncertainty in the field about what constitutes skilled nursing care. In  		discussing the patient vignettes, the nurses disagreed about whether the  		services needed by these patients represented skilled care. In particular, the  		nurses were uncertain whether wound care represented a skilled need. Further,  		it appeared that nurses were not the only members of the medical community who  		were unclear about this concept. Nurses reported that physicians often referred  		patients to home care who do not need skilled nursing services, apparently  		maintaining an incorrect understanding what does and does not constitute  		skilled care.</p>
<p> Management and evaluation (M&amp;E) also appeared to be an elusive  		concept. Focus group participants' understanding of M&amp;E differed widely  		from agency to agency. Some nurses indicated that M&amp;E applied to patients  		with IV therapy and family members who were not able to learn the medication  		regimen. Other nurses suggested that M&amp;E was appropriate only for complex  		patients with multiple caregivers, needing many hours of service. A few nurses  		even thought that M&amp;E required special training for nurses.</p>
<p> The lack of clarity in coverage rules did not appear to encourage home  		care providers to continue to provide services to patients ready for discharge.  		Despite the wide variation in their understanding of the concept of homebound,  		the nurses participating in these interviews did not appear to use this lack of  		conceptual clarity to their advantage. In fact, some of the nurses reported  		discharging patients before they were thought to be ready because the patients  		were believed to no longer meet the criteria for homebound status. In cases in  		which nurses held inaccurate views of the kinds of activities a homebound  		patient should not be able to participate in (e.g., driving), patients who  		might legitimately be considered homebound could have been prematurely  		discharged as a result of the nurses' misunderstanding of the regulations.</p>
<p> Not only was there no evidence that ambiguity in coverage rules lead to  		the provision of unnecessary services, there was some suggestion in the focus  		group and case study data that this ambiguity may actually have resulted in  		shorter episodes of care. One focus group participant indicated that "in a case  		where you might be borderline on discharging or making another visit, [her  		agency] would lean toward not making another visit for fear of Medicare  		review." Further, the focus group interviews produced some evidence that  		agencies may avoid the use of services for which the coverage rules are  		ambiguous. During most of the focus group interviews, nurses indicated that  		M&amp;E is not used at their agencies. Uncertainty about the meaning of the  		coverage rules with regard to M&amp;E may have encouraged agencies to avoid the  		practice altogether. </p>
<p> Lack of clarity with regard to the Medicare coverage rules appeared to  		have a strong impact on decision making in home health care. Evidence from the  		focus group and case study interviews suggest that home care nurses often may  		misinterpret the rules and that, at times, such misinterpretations may result  		in inappropriate underutilization of services for certain patients. Efforts to  		clarify the regulations and educate care providers should ensure that patients  		receive the care they need and for which they are eligible.</p>
<h3><a name="chapVIID" id="chapVIID">D. Conclusions</a></h3>
<p> The field of home health care has seen dramatic changes over the past  		several years. Since the collection of the data used in this study, several  		major changes have been implemented that are expected to have a powerful impact  		on the practice of home health care. The implementation of PPS in October 2000  		and the resulting major shift in financial incentives facing agencies has been  		mentioned several times. Under PPS, agencies have strong incentives to minimize  		visits and otherwise constrain costs. Such incentives could result in  		inappropriate underutilization of care and declining patient outcomes.</p>
<p> A possibly countervailing change is the 1999 implementation of the  		Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data collection and transmission  		requirement for all Medicare-certified home health agencies and the generation  		of case mix, adverse event, and outcome reports for these agencies. (The  		outcome reports became available in early 2002.) Outcome reports can be a  		powerful tool for outcome-based quality improvement (OBQI) by home health care  		providers (Shaughnessy, Crisler, Hittle, Schlenker 2002a; Shaughnessy, Hittle,  		Crisler, Powell 2002b) and may help offset the possibly negative consequences  		of PPS for patient outcomes. The findings from this study will provide a useful  		baseline of information on practice patterns during the IPS period, allowing  		researchers to identify the impact of the implementation of PPS and other  		recent federal regulations. </p>

To be  			 eligible for participation, patients were required to have an ICD-9 code  			 representing CHF (i.e., 398.91, 428.0, 428.1, 428.9, 402.01, 402.11, 402.91,  			 404.01, 404.03, 404.11, 404.13, 404.91, 404.93, 429.4) or diabetes mellitus  			 (i.e., 250.0 through 250.9). Some patients had ICD-9 codes reflecting both CHF  			 and diabetes mellitus. </p>

<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">With</a> allowance for attrition and incomplete  			 data, the target analysis sample was 1,152 patients--the equivalent of 48  			 agencies with 24 patients per agency. Greater than expected agency attrition  			 and missing patient assessment data resulted in a smaller than expected final  			 patient sample. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">Data</a> collection was ended in August 2000 to  			 ensure that the data would not be confounded by the implementation of the  			 Prospective Payment System (PPS). Thus, the data examined as part of this study  			 reflect practice patterns and patient outcomes under IPS only. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">The</a> data collection protocol specified that  			 data collection was to be discontinued 240 days after a patient's original  			 start of care date. However, as many long-stay patients are discharged and  			 admitted multiple times during the course of their care, it is common for the  			 timing of their recertification periods to differ from the timing one would  			 expect based on their initial start of care dates in the study. In order to  			 retain as many complete episodes as possible, all recertification, transfer,  			 and discharge data collected through 260 days were retained. However, data  			 representing the beginning of a new episode of care (i.e., start of care,  			 resumption of care, and readmission assessments) were collected only through  			 240 days from the original start of care date. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">Patients</a> who were discharged from their  			 agencies and resumed services within 14 days of discharge were readmitted to  			 the study. This definition of discharge was meant to control for variability in  			 agency-specific policies regarding inpatient facility admission. Some agencies  			 discharge patients at the time of admission to inpatient facilities, whereas  			 others discharge patients after a certain number of hospital days. Using 14  			 days after agency discharge as the definition of study discharge allowed for  			 the collection of equivalent data for those patients who were and were not  			 discharged at the time of their inpatient facility admissions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">The</a> eight agencies selected to participate in  			 the focus groups and case studies all are included in the final sample of 44  			 agencies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">To</a> avoid introducing excessive variation in the  			 case study data, which might have made thematic analysis of the data from this  			 small sample difficult, the case study sample was restricted to patients with a  			 single tracer condition, CHF. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">Assessment</a> time points differed slightly on the  			 OASIS and the CPQ. On the OASIS, an assessment at the beginning of an episode  			 is identified as either a start of care assessment or as a resumption of care  			 following an inpatient stay during which the patient was not discharged from  			 the agency. At the end of an episode, a patient is discharged, transferred to  			 an inpatient facility with or without agency discharge, or dies at home. On the  			 CPQ, an assessment at the beginning of an episode is identified as a start of  			 care assessment (equivalent to a start of care on OASIS), a resumption of care  			 after an inpatient stay during which the patient was not discharged from the  			 agency (equivalent to an OASIS resumption of care), or a readmission to the  			 agency within 14 days of agency discharge (equivalent to an OASIS start of  			 care). At the end of a CPQ episode, a patient is discharged. There is no option  			 for transfer on the CPQ. For this reason, at transfer, only OASIS data were  			 collected. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note16" id="note16">Because</a> analyses were conducted at the episode  			 level, patients with multiple episodes of care were represented more than once  			 in the analyses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note17" id="note17">All</a> multivariate analyses were conducted across  			 the final sample of patient episodes, rather than separately by tracer  			 condition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">Some</a> patient factor variables were designated  			 as "required" because they reflect areas in which patients with CHF and  			 diabetes mellitus differed.

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note21" id="note21">It</a> is important to note that, although we  			 attempted to sample agencies randomly, participation in the study was  			 voluntary.

<li>
<p><a name="note24" id="note24">Patients</a> were identified as having one or both  			 tracer conditions using ICD-9 codes.

The NSA is included in <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note25" id="note25">The</a> calculation of the number of episodes per  			 patient is based on those episodes for which complete episode-level assessment  			 data were available.

<li>
<p><a name="note27" id="note27">Each</a> ADL and IADL data item was transformed  			 into a number of dichotomous variables. The three dichotomies created for each  			 ADL data item identified whether a patient was mildly, moderately, or severely  			 disabled. The two IADL dichotomies reflected whether a patient was mildly or  			 severely disabled with regard to a given IADL. In general, the mild dichotomy  			 split the original scale at the lowest level at which a patient required human  			 supervision or assistance. The severe dichotomy split the scale at the other  			 end, differentiating patients who were totally dependent from those who were  			 capable of participating or assisting in a given task (e.g., eating) to some  			 extent. The moderate dichotomy split each scale at an intermediate level that  			 was considered to be clinically meaningful, but was different from scale to  			 scale. The dichotomies then were summed to identify the number of disabilities  			 at a given level (e.g., number of mild ADL disabilities). Note that the  			 disability measures are not exclusive. That is, if a patient is completely  			 dependent in grooming, the mild, moderate, and severe dichotomies for this ADL  			 each will reflect this disability. </p>

<li>
<p><a name="note29" id="note29">Feedback</a> regarding the care plan represented  			 the amount of input a care provider received from other agency personnel  			 regarding a patient's care plan. This variable was calculated as the average of  			 three dichotomous (yes/no) CPQ variables indicating whether the primary care  			 provider received feedback from other agency personnel regarding (1) the  			 appropriate frequency of skilled nursing visits, (2) whether aide services  			 should be provided, and (3) when discharge should occur.

<li>
<p><a name="note30" id="note30">Because</a> length of stay data often are skewed,  			 length of stay was log transformed (natural log) to normalize the distribution.

<p><a name="note36" id="note36">Unexpectedly</a>, patients with more severe dyspnea  			 received care from significantly fewer disciplines than did patients with less  			 severe shortness of breath.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note37" id="note37">The</a> care provider conducting the start of care  			 visit is particularly important in that he or she is likely to develop the  			 patient's plan of care and to conduct the majority of the visits with the  			 patient throughout the episode of care. </p>

Many of the points are  		based on data in the tables presented in <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>. (The  		AARP reports listed in <a href="#tableD.1">Table D.1</a> are the sources for  		most of the information about the states contained in <a href="#chapIII">Chapter 3</a>.)</p>
<h3>B. Low-Volume States</h3>
<h4>1. Minnesota</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>: Minnesota  		is enjoying a strong economy and a low unemployment rate. However, the poverty  		level among the elderly is above average. The population overall has good  		health status. For example, compared to the other study states, there are fewer  		elderly people with difficulty in mobility or self care.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: Minnesota has one  		of the lowest uninsured rates in the country and a greater than average number  		of physician generalists. The Medicaid program appears to be quite generous.  		Minnesota is attempting to increase the use of managed care through  		MinnesotaCare Acts of 1992. It is also trying to increase third-party revenues  		such as Medicare. Compared to other states, there is a high level of HMO  		penetration. However, the level of Medicare enrollment in Risk HMOs is below  		the national average. </p>
<h4>2. New Jersey</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>: New  		Jersey is the most urbanized and densely populated of all states in the nation.  		New Jersey has a high per capita income ($32,700 compared to $25,600 nationally  		in 1997) and more of the state's elderly are insured than average. Of the study  		states, New Jersey has the lowest rate of persons 65 years or older living  		alone.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: New Jersey's large  		Medicaid program comprises about one-fourth of the state's budget, and is  		moving toward managed care and home and community-based care instead of  		institutional care. Despite relatively high Medicaid expenditures on home and  		community-based care, 84 percent of New Jersey's Medicaid long-term care  		expenditures go to nursing homes. Widespread interest in home and  		community-based care expansion has targeted existing nursing home spending for  		budget cuts. Medicaid spends an average of nearly $4,000 more per elderly  		enrollee than the national average. New Jersey has a low rate of physician  		generalists and a low rate of nursing home residents per 1000 elderly. Of the  		study states, New Jersey has the lowest rate of Medicare beneficiaries covered  		by Medicaid.</p>
<h4>3. Oregon</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>:  		Throughout the 1990's, Oregon's population growth rate was twice the national  		average, and a successfully diversified economy led to economic growth and wage  		increases. From 1990 to 1998, Oregon experienced a seven percent drop in the  		number of uninsured residents, leaving only 11 percent without insurance.  		However, this number has recently begun to increase as the state's economy has  		somewhat weakened. Oregon's population is comprised of 6.4 percent ethnic and  		racial minorities, well under the 17.4 percent national average. Of all the  		study states, Oregon has the lowest percentage of elderly persons living below  		the poverty line. </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: As in Pennsylvania  		and a handful of other states, Oregon requires all Medicaid beneficiaries to  		enroll in managed care. This is one provision of the Oregon Health Plan (OHP)  		enacted in 1989, which also expands Medicaid eligibility to the poor and  		requires employers to provide insurance to their workers. Oregon is the only  		study state spending more Medicaid dollars on home and community-based health  		services than on institutional care provided in nursing homes. Most elderly  		Medicaid beneficiaries in Oregon are enrolled in a managed care plan, and  		traditional long-term care services such as physical therapy and home health  		are covered by this plan. Of the study states, Oregon has the lowest number of  		nursing home beds, and is one of only two states in the nation to have had a  		decline in this number. </p>
<h4>4. Pennsylvania</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>:  		Pennsylvania's economy is the sixth largest in the nation (as measured by gross  		state product). The economy is characterized by service industries, which have  		replaced manufacturing as the predominant source of output. Roughly 16 percent  		of Pennsylvania's residents are over 65 years of age, second only to Florida.  		Of the low-volume study states, Pennsylvania has the highest rate of elderly  		having difficulty in mobility or self care. </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: Pennsylvania's  		large elderly population and the extensive penetration of managed care  		distinguish the state's health care system from other states, and are reflected  		in Pennsylvania's large Medicaid program. Between 1990 and 1996, Medicaid  		spending on long-term care and acute care services for the elderly increased by  		140 percent, well above the national average (80 percent). Pennsylvania has  		increased its enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care during the  		past decade. Overall enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries in some form of  		managed care programs increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 70 percent in August  		1998. Though experiencing financial challenges, Pennsylvania's mandatory  		Medicaid HMO enrollment program, Healthshares, has been implemented in  		Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and will be introduced throughout the state in  		2000.</p>
<h3>C. High-Volume States</h3>
<h4>1. Georgia</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>: The  		population in Georgia is rapidly growing and the state's economy is strong.  		About one-third of the state's population is African-American (compared to 12.5  		percent for the nation as a whole). Of all the study states, Georgia has the  		lowest elderly population percentage (9.9 percent aged 65 and over in 1998).  		Despite this, compared to other states, residents of Georgia do not fare as  		well on many indicators of health status. For example, Georgia has a higher  		rate of premature death and of elderly having difficulty in mobility or self  		care than all the study states other than Mississippi. </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: Although the  		Medicaid program in Georgia is considered to be generous, the rate of growth  		for Medicaid programs for the elderly is below the national average. For  		example, long-term care spending per elderly Medicaid recipient is  		significantly less than the national average. Most long-term care spending  		(70.5 percent) is for institutional care. Compared to other states, there are  		fewer nursing facility beds available in Georgia and a lower nursing home  		utilization rate. Currently, the state has very low Medicare enrollment in Risk  		HMOs (3.9 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in 1998).</p>
<h4>2. Massachusetts</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>:  		Massachusetts differs from the other high-volume states in many  		characteristics. It has a largely urbanized population with a relatively high  		percentage of elderly (13.8 percent, the highest of the high-volume states).  		Per capita income is approximately $6,000 higher in Massachusetts compared to  		the national average and individuals tend to have good scores on standard  		measures of health (e.g., low premature death rates). In addition, the number  		of persons aged 65 and over with difficulty in mobility or self-care is  		substantially lower compared to the other high-volume study states.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: Massachusetts is  		characterized as having a very generous Medicaid program. The Medicaid program  		is expanding its managed care component and is substituting community-based  		long-term care services for institutional services whenever possible. There are  		twice as many Medicaid home health recipients per 1000 recipients compared to  		the other high-volume study states. The state is regarded as successful in  		shifting Medicaid long-term care expenditures to Medicare (i.e., Medicaid bills  		Medicare for home health and nursing home care when possible). Compared to  		other states, Massachusetts is very concerned about "Medicaid Estate Planning"  		(i.e., individuals who provide misleading information about their financial  		situation in order to qualify for Medicaid).</p>
<p> Over one-fifth (21.4 percent) of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in  		Risk HMOs, a figure that is above average for the nation and roughly twice as  		high as the average HMO penetration rate for the four high-volume study states.  		Of the four high-volume study states, Massachusetts also has the highest  		percentage of individuals covered by private insurance. </p>
<h4>3. Mississippi</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>: The  		majority of Mississippi's population is classified as living in rural areas,  		and approximately two-fifths of the population is African-American.  		Mississippi's economy has experienced recent growth, partly due to an increase  		in legalized gambling revenues. The state is one of the poorest in the nation,  		with a high unemployment rate and low per capita income. Mississippi's poverty  		rate is the highest of all the study states, and is eight percentage points  		higher than the national average (29.9 percent versus 21.7 percent).  		Mississippi residents have relatively poor health status, and the state has the  		highest number of persons 65 years or older per thousand that have difficulty  		in mobility or self-care of all study states, a figure about 38 percent higher  		than the national average (276.9 percent versus 201.1 percent). </p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: Managed care has  		only recently entered Mississippi and has faced physician shortages in creating  		provider networks. As a result, HMO penetration is low; about two percent of  		Mississippi residents (compared to 23 percent nationally) receive health  		services from an HMO. Compared to other study states and the nation, there is a  		small number of nursing facility beds in Mississippi, and nursing homes have a  		99 percent occupancy rate. Mississippi's Medicaid program accounted for 22  		percent of total state expenditures in 1995 and the federal Medicaid matching  		rate is the highest in the country at 77.2 percent. The Medicaid program has a  		high rate of expenditure growth but does not spend as much as the national  		average on long-term care services such as home health. This is due to a strict  		certificate-of-need policy restricting capacity. Additionally, the Medicaid  		program continues to utilize mostly institutional care more than home and  		community-based care, which is relatively sparse and dominated by Medicare.  		</p>
<h4>4. Texas</h4>
<p>	<i><strong>Demographic-Economic Characteristics</strong></i>: Compared  		to other study states, the Texas population is characterized by higher rates of  		poverty and uninsured individuals, and the majority of its 254 counties are  		considered rural. In addition, the proportion of Hispanics in Texas is high  		relative to the rest of the nation. With respect to several indicators of  		health status and the percentage of elderly living alone, Texans are similar to  		the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>	<i><strong>Health Care System Features</strong></i>: Texas is a  		politically conservative state with a strong anti-tax philosophy (as  		illustrated by the fact that Texas does not have an income tax). The state is  		described as taking "a minimalist approach to health and social welfare  		programs, funding little beyond what is required to draw down federal matching  		payments" (Wiener et al., 1998). Medicaid eligibility requirements are  		restrictive though the program is growing (mainly because the state is trying  		to obtain the highest level of federal matching funds possible). The state has  		a large home and community-based services program, and it has the highest  		Medicaid expenditure percentage for personal care (12.0 percent) of all study  		states. The movement toward managed care is growing; most HMOs in the state are  		proprietary organizations.</p>

<p> This appendix contains the list of independent variables included in  		the multivariate analyses, which are summarized in <a href="#chapIV"> Chapter  		4</a>. As described in <a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a>, this list (Table F.1)  		includes the patient, provider, agency, market/regulatory, and practice pattern  		variables of greatest theoretical interest. Some potential independent  		variables were eliminated from the multivariate analyses as a result of large  		amounts of missing data and/or a lack of sufficient variability. Others were  		removed because of strong correlations with other important independent  		variables. Some of the independent variables presented in Table F.1 were  		identified as being of particular theoretical importance. These "required  		variables" were included in the final multivariate analysis models, regardless  		of their degree of statistical significance in the preliminary models. The  		variables designated as required are identified in the table. (The procedure  		for conducting the multivariate analyses is described in detail in  		<a href="#chapII">Chapter 2</a>.) </p>
