<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Balancing the need to assure both autonomy and safety is a major  		challenge when providing long-term care services to older persons who reside in  		licensed group settings, because provider policies and state regulations  		intended to ensure safety can conflict with individuals' ability to make the  		choices they prefer. One approach proposed to achieve a balance is the use of a  		negotiated risk agreement (NRA), which was developed as a practical strategy to  		operationalize resident autonomy in this environment. </p>
<p>Processes and documents similar to NRAs exist in health care  		settings--for example informed consent--but the specific process and structure  		of NRAs are unique to assisted living (i.e., written documents that list): </p>
<ul><li>the behavior or resident preference of concern to the provider; </li>
<li>the potential or actual risk; </li>
<li>the resident preferences and potential provider accommodations or  		  suggested alternatives to the behavior that reduce risk while meeting resident  		  preferences; </li>
<li>a negotiated resolution; and </li>
<li>the resident's acknowledgement and acceptance of the potential  		  negative consequences of his or her actions. </li>
</ul><p>NRAs were conceived to help assisted living meet its goal of providing a  		residential alternative to institutional care that provides frail and  		cognitively impaired older persons an option that maximizes privacy,  		independence, choice, and the maintenance of a normal lifestyle--qualities that  		are generally lacking in institutional long-term care settings. Over the past  		decade, many assisted living providers have adopted NRAs, and several states  		have regulatory provisions regarding their use. However, their use is not  		without controversy. </p>
<h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
<p>The use of NRAs is a new topic in a relatively new long-term care  		setting. This study is designed to inform state policy makers, assisted living  		providers, and key stakeholders about NRAs and issues related to their use. The  		study's major objectives are to:</p>
<ul><li>Describe states' statutory and regulatory provisions related to NRAs  		  and analyze the policy objectives that NRAs are designed to meet.</li>
<li>Analyze and better understand the debate surrounding NRAs.</li>
<li>Gain an understanding of how assisted living providers, staff, and  		  residents view and use NRAs. </li>
</ul><h3>Methods</h3>
<p>We used standard policy analysis and qualitative research techniques,  		including a review of the published and unpublished literature; a review of  		statutes, regulations, and case law for all 50 states and the District of  		Columbia; discussions with over 50 experts and key stakeholders in long-term  		care law, policy, and practice; and in-depth interviews with 46 staff and  		residents of seven assisted living facilities in three states--Florida, Oregon,  		and Wisconsin. </p>
<h3>State Regulations Regarding NRAs</h3>
<p>Forty-one states have regulations that govern residential care settings  		called assisted living. The majority of states have no provisions related to  		NRAs in either statute or administrative code, leaving their use to the  		discretion of providers unless they are prohibited under other state statutes.  		Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have NRA or closely related  		provisions related to managing risk (<i>hereafter</i>, the states). No state  		explicitly prohibits the use of NRAs, though several place restrictions on  		their use. </p>

</tr></table><p>State regulations regarding NRAs and related concepts vary in their  		provisions and specificity, but all states view NRAs or a similar process as a  		means to support residents' choices that conflict with medical advice or  		facility norms while managing the risks associated with their choices. Most  		states link NRAs with service planning. </p>
<p>Wisconsin is the only state that requires all persons entering a  		specific type of assisted living--Residential Care Apartment Complexes--to have  		an NRA at admission. Of the 15 states with NRA provisions, four do not  		reference NRAs as a distinct document that is written or signed, instead  		referring to risk discussions as part of service planning or provisions for  		managing risk. </p>
<h3>The Debate Surrounding NRAs</h3>
<p><i><b>Purpose of NRAs</b></i></p>
<p>Views about the purpose of NRAs are polarized. The 15 states that  		reference NRAs or similar processes in their assisted living regulations and  		the majority of proponents believe NRAs have several purposes, providing: (1) a  		tool for identifying and reducing risks, (2) a communication tool for  		discussing risks and setting expectations, and (3) a method to support  		residents' rights to make choices that entail risk. Some states and proponents  		also view NRAs as a method for assigning responsibility and limiting provider  		liability. </p>
<p>The strongest opponents tend to view NRAs as having a sole purpose--an  		attempt to avoid liability for negative outcomes resulting from negligence.  		Others recognize that "good" providers may use NRAs to identify and reduce  		risks, but fear that "bad" providers will use them to force residents to accept  		substandard care because they have no practical alternative or fear discharge  		to an institutional setting. Several argue that residents are in an unequal  		bargaining position due to frailty, lack of acceptable alternatives, and the  		difficulty with relocation. </p>
<p>Furthermore, opponents believe consumers should not be required to  		negotiate to exercise autonomy in assisted living because they already have the  		right to make the choices NRAs are designed to foster. Proponents counter that  		the rights of residents in licensed facilities are constrained and that  		providers worried about their potential liability for the negative outcomes of  		residents' choices often overtly curtail residents' autonomy or apply subtle  		coercion to restrict it. </p>
<p>Both proponents and opponents were divided regarding the ability to  		mitigate the potential negative consequences of NRAs through law and  		regulation. Opponents believe that prohibiting NRAs altogether rather than  		risking abuse best serves the public interest; proponents believe the public is  		best served by allowing NRAs and implementing regulatory protections. If a  		state allows or require NRAs, opponents also believe that regulatory  		protections are needed. </p>
<p><i><b>Liability Waivers</b></i></p>
<p>Liability waivers--specific or implied--are the main issue that  		polarizes views about NRAs. Some proponents claim that NRAs are not and never  		were intended to limit provider liability while others argue that they were  		always intended to create a balance within a regulated setting, allowing  		resident autonomy by providing an appropriate amount of liability protection  		for providers. Many argue that without limiting provider liability that could  		result from residents' risky choices, providers will continue to restrict  		residents' autonomy in favor of safety. Most proponents note, however, that  		blanket waivers of liability are never appropriate. </p>
<p>An interesting feature of the debate about NRAs and liability waivers is  		that few proponents <i>or</i> opponents believe that NRAs can effectively limit  		legal liability, whether or not they include a specific liability waiver. The  		legal status of an NRA as a contract has yet to be determined, yet virtually no  		one believes that broad liability waivers are enforceable or that specific  		liability waivers are enforceable if negligence resulted in harm to a resident  		or if providers violated express regulatory requirements. </p>
<p><i><b>NRAs and State Admission and Discharge Requirements</b></i></p>
<p>Several opponents believe that providers will use NRAs to allow  		residents to remain in a facility after their needs exceed regulatory discharge  		requirements--sidestepping regulations in an effort to maintain their census  		without increasing staffing. The consensus of legal experts was that NRAs or  		any private contracts, as a general rule, can not overrule regulations or law  		because deregulation by private contract is not enforceable. Nor can NRAs  		supplant a provider's fulfillment of a statutory duty. </p>
<p>Some states explicitly prohibit the use of NRAs to override  		state-mandated discharge requirements. Nonetheless, it appears that NRAs and  		similar agreements can be specifically included in regulations as a mechanism  		to allow residents to accept risks within parameters established by regulations  		or as a defined mechanism with which to override state discharge requirements  		under certain circumstances. In other words, residents do not have a right to  		use NRAs to enforce their choices in opposition to the state's (or, generally,  		the provider's) rules unless the state explicitly provides in law or regulation  		for NRAs to do so. </p>
<p><i><b>Limitations on the Use of NRAs</b></i></p>
<p>When asked about specific issues related to the use of NRAs--for  		example, what topics are appropriate, whether providers should determine  		residents' decision-making capacity through a formal assessment prior to  		executing an NRA, and whether third parties should be allowed to execute an NRA  		on a resident's behalf--there was a lack of consensus. Many said their position  		on these issues would depend on the circumstances. Some providers said that  		more guidance on such issues would be helpful. </p>
<p>In sum, stakeholders and experts disagree about the advantages and  		disadvantages of NRAs. The meaning of "risk" and views regarding the relative  		importance of protection and autonomy varies among the many disciplines  		involved in assisted living practice--providers, consumer advocates,  		regulators, nurses, social workers, attorneys, and insurers. Even among  		advocates, especially between traditional advocates for the elderly and  		advocates for persons with disabilities, views on the need for NRAs and  		implementation standards vary widely. </p>
<h3>How Assisted Living Providers, Staff, and Residents View  		and Use NRAs</h3>
<p>Most of the experts and stakeholders we interviewed had strong views  		about NRAs, but few had firsthand experience with them. The primary purpose of  		our site visits was to get a sense of how NRAs are actually used and the views  		of those directly involved.</p>
<ul><li>With the exception of Wisconsin, which mandates NRAs for all  		  residents admitted to a specific type of assisted living (Residential Care  		  Apartment Complexes), NRAs appear to be used infrequently and selectively,  		  generally only when informal discussions have not resolved an issue that has  		  arisen more than once.</li>
<li>Staff view NRAs primarily as a complement to service planning and a  		  useful method for addressing residents' behaviors or choices that they believe  		  pose risks to their health and safety. In particular, they foster discussion  		  about difficult issues that providers, residents, and families might otherwise  		  avoid. All staff agreed that behaviors that place staff or other residents at  		  risk are not appropriate for negotiation.</li>
<li>While some staff believe that NRAs could provide some liability  		  protection in the event of a lawsuit over a negative outcome, they do not view  		  this potential protection as the sole or primary purpose of the NRA. All  		  management and professional staff agreed that an explicit discussion with  		  residents and families about risk and of measures that can be taken to reduce  		  risk can reduce providers' liability exposure.</li>
<li>In no case, with the information available to us, did we determine  		  that NRAs were being used to pressure residents into accepting inadequate care,  		  the primary concern of NRA opponents. None of the NRAs we reviewed supported  		  the view that providers are using NRAs exclusively as a liability "dodge" to  		  allow them to admit and keep residents beyond the facility's capacity to care  		  for them--or for poor quality care. However, some standardized NRAs were overly  		  broad and inappropriate for persons with cognitive impairment (e.g., one  		  facility had a standard NRA form that included a statement that a resident  		  accepts responsibility for risk of injury due to wandering).</li>
<li>All residents believed strongly that they should be able to make  		  lifestyle and personal decisions that may place them at risk. Several residents  		  did not remember signing the agreement or the specific details of their  		  agreements.</li>
<li>No facility uses a formal method to determine decision-making  		  capacity prior to executing an NRA. In most cases, staff assess this capacity  		  through informal observations of memory loss and poor judgment. Many staff do  		  not appear to be knowledgeable about the cognitive domains and other factors  		  that affect decision-making capacity.</li>
<li>Some facilities are allowing surrogates to sign NRAs without  		  knowledge of their legal standing to accept risk on behalf of the  		  resident.</li>
<li>Some staff expressed frustration with the need to assure residents'  		  autonomy based on two concerns: (1) fear that residents might get hurt when  		  staff have a moral obligation to protect them, and (2) concern that staff are  		  held responsible for all negative outcomes.</li>
<li>Often, direct care staff did not have much familiarity with the  		  concept of NRAs, know that an individual resident had an NRA, or, if they knew  		  a resident had an NRA, they did not know what impact it had on service delivery  		  or a resident's ability to assume risk.</li>
<li>Some NRAs were used for issues other than specific risks. For  		  example, to note a general risk factor like blindness or obesity, or as a  		  behavior modification agreement, stating that unless a resident ceased a  		  particular behavior, like smoking or disturbing the peace, they would be  		  discharged from the facility. </li>
</ul><h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Assisted living providers, policy makers, aging advocates, and long-term  		care experts have defined NRAs as a mechanism to enhance resident choice by  		providing a rigorous process designed to balance autonomy and risk for  		residents and providers in assisted living. While our sample is small and not  		representative, our findings suggest that NRAs can be a useful tool to help  		residents and providers achieve a balance between desires for autonomy and  		concerns about safety. At the same time, they suggest that the NRA concept is  		proving difficult to broadly and consistently operationalize.</p>
<ul><li>NRA processes and purposes are not well understood and appear to vary  		  widely across states, providers, and even staff in the same facility. While  		  this may not be surprising given that assisted living varies widely within and  		  across states, it does raise significant concerns about standards for the  		  process. As identified in this study, the appropriate use of NRAs requires at a  		  minimum, guidance in their use, as well as education and training.</li>
<li>NRAs are not being used uniformly to maximize resident autonomy by  		  balancing specific risks and consumer preferences as supporters advocate. Few  		  of the NRAs we reviewed adhered to a form, process, or guidelines appropriate  		  for the practice concept or to the recommendations in the Assisted Living  		  Federation of America's report on NRAs. While some NRAs fit advocates'  		  concepts, others that we reviewed addressed appropriate issues but did not  		  include a discussion of alternatives or a negotiation, instead presenting  		  topics in an either/or framework. Some NRAs simply identified the risk, stated  		  that the resident should not do what staff identified as risky, and then noted  		  that the resident planned to continue and accepted the risk.</li>
<li>The enforceability of liability waivers has not been tested in the  		  courts but most experts do not believe that NRAs with such waivers provide any  		  more liability protection than those without them. NRAs can be structured to  		  address provider and consumer concerns without using formal or even an implicit  		  liability waiver. Most experts agreed that the availability of a signed  		  document recording formal discussions between the facility and resident  		  regarding risky choices, staff attempts to reduce risk, and the residents'  		  acknowledgment of their choice despite the risks could be comparable in  		  protection to a formal waiver of liability in the event of a law suit. Given  		  this, proponents would be advised to give less attention to liability waivers  		  and more to assuring that providers follow recommended practices when executing  		  NRAs. In particular, issues related to executing NRAs with individuals who may  		  lack decision-making capacity should receive more attention. </li>
</ul><p>Whether NRAs should be used or continued with residents who have  		cognitive impairment is unclear. If an individual includes the authority to  		enter into an NRA in a power of attorney or if a court has granted a guardian  		this power, legal concerns about the use of surrogates are lessened. In most  		states, guidelines regarding NRAs and surrogates are either completely lacking  		or do not adequately address this issue. Additional state guidance regarding  		appropriate and inappropriate use of surrogates would be helpful to providers  		and would afford protection to persons with cognitive impairment. </p>
<p>It may be possible to address certain risk topics found in our review of  		NRAs using a process that is more closely tied to service planning,  		particularly to address areas of risk that are typically dealt with in service  		plans, such as prescribed diets, medications, and use of bedrails. For example,  		to obtain the primary advantages of fostering communication and documenting  		discussions and choices, providers could use forms that address "specialized  		service planning issues" as well as forms that are treated as addendums to the  		service plan. This approach would have the advantage of being part of initial  		and ongoing service planning while avoiding the legal complexities of an NRA.  		However, an enhanced serving planning approach would not afford the benefits of  		negotiation and risk assumption that many proponents believe are the primary  		value of NRAs--both to enhance resident autonomy and protect providers from  		liability for the consequences of residents' choices. </p>
<p>While many advocates and opponents characterize the debate as absolute  		for or against NRAs, the debate is better characterized as an attempt to  		determine acceptable limits to choice and what process best achieves a balance  		between autonomy and safety. It seems likely that with increasing attention to  		the rights of persons with disabilities to exercise choice and assume risk in  		both long-term care settings and independent housing, strategies for enhancing  		older persons' autonomy will become increasingly important. </p>
<p>NRAs or similar processes show some promise in providing a practical  		approach to enhancing resident autonomy in a living environment where a  		regulatory emphasis on safety and concerns about liability are salient factors  		affecting provider behavior. However, if NRAs are the correct tool for striking  		a reasonable balance between safety and autonomy, states, consumer advocates,  		provider associations, and the legal community need to give more detailed  		attention to how their use should be operationalized so they can play a  		significant role and to prevent potential abuse. Stakeholders also need to  		examine what role NRAs' can or should play in providing a process for  		"reasonable accommodation" when state or provider proscribed admission and  		discharge limits conflict with residents' preferences. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In May 1980, 83-year-old Harry Truman refused to leave his home on the  		side of Mount St. Helens despite predictions that the volcano was about to  		erupt. He was described at the time as a "crotchety" but "rugged individual"  		who stood "true to himself."<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Truman's act of independence resulted in his  		death (and that of his 16 cats) and the creation of a song, a memoir,<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note2">2</a></font></sup> a hiking trail, and a memorial at  		the entrance to the nearby town of Castle Rock, Washington. </p>
<p>Truman's instant status as a folk hero demonstrates the value Americans  		place on independence, autonomy, choice, and home, even when the individual  		making the choices is very old and taking great risks.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> However, if Truman had resided in a licensed  		long-term care (LTC) setting, as many 83-year-olds do, he would likely have  		found his ability to make choices and assume risks greatly restricted based on  		concerns about his safety. It is a certainty that he would not have been  		allowed to stay by Mount St. Helens or have 16 cats. </p>
<p>Balancing the need to assure both autonomy and safety is a major  		challenge when providing LTC services to older persons who reside in licensed  		group settings, because provider policies and state regulations intended to  		ensure safety can conflict with individuals' ability to make the choices they  		prefer.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> One approach  		proposed to achieve a balance is the use of a negotiated risk agreement (NRA),  		which was developed as a practical strategy to operationalize resident autonomy  		in a litigious LTC environment. </p>
<p>NRAs were conceived to help assisted living meet its goal of providing a  		residential alternative to institutional care that provides frail and  		cognitively impaired older persons a residential option that maximizes privacy,  		independence, choice, and the maintenance of a normal lifestyle--qualities that  		are generally lacking in institutional LTC settings.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> Advocates of the assisted living philosophy  		believe that residents and providers share the responsibility to develop  		individualized plans to meet the residents' needs and preferences, including  		preferences that entail risk, in order to maintain or improve the quality of  		residents' lives. Basically, an NRA documents a process designed to assure that  		residents maintain control over their lives while acknowledging provider and  		state responsibility to assure quality and safety within the context of  		resident preferences.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Over the past decade, many assisted living providers have adopted NRAs,  		and several states have regulatory provisions regarding their use. However,  		their use is not without controversy. Supporters believe they foster documented  		discussions that allow providers to become comfortable with risks that  		residents want to assume, thereby helping to prevent situations where  		providers, in an effort to assure safety and reduce liability risk, limit  		residents' choices through facility policies. </p>
<p>Opponents believe consumers should not be required to negotiate to  		exercise autonomy in assisted living because they already have the right to  		make the choices NRAs are designed to foster. Additionally, some believe that  		providers may abuse NRAs by using them as a liability dodge for insufficient or  		poor quality care. </p>
<h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
<p>The use of NRAs is a new topic in a relatively new LTC setting. This  		study is designed to inform state policy makers, assisted living providers, and  		key stakeholders about NRAs and issues related to their use. The study's major  		objectives are to:</p>
<ul><li>Describe states' statutory and regulatory provisions related to NRAs  		  and analyze the policy objectives that NRAs are designed to meet.</li>
<li>Analyze and better understand the debate surrounding NRAs.</li>
<li>Gain an understanding of how assisted living providers, staff, and  		  residents view and use NRAs. </li>
</ul><h3>Methods</h3>
<p>To conduct this study, we used standard policy analysis and qualitative  		research techniques, including a review of the published and unpublished  		literature; a review of statutes, regulations, and case law for all 50 states  		and the District of Columbia; discussions with over 50 experts and key  		stakeholders in LTC law, policy, and practice; and in-depth interviews with 46  		staff and residents of seven assisted living facilities in three  		states--Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin. <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>  		contains a detailed description of the study's methods. </p>
<p>Some proponents of NRAs use the term "shared responsibility agreement"  		rather than NRA to emphasize that the resident and the provider are sharing  		risk. Some states use the term managed risk agreements. In this report, we use  		the term NRA as the generic term for risk agreements. We will use other  		state-specific terms for risk agreements when discussing those states. </p>
<h3>Organization of the Report</h3>
<p>The remainder of this report is organized in four sections.  		<a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#define">Section II</a> discusses NRA concepts and use.  		<a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#debate">Section III</a> discusses the wide range of legal and policy  		issues related to the use of NRAs, including liability waivers, the role of  		NRAs in the discharge process, and residents' mental capacity to enter into an  		NRA. <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#visit">Section IV</a> presents our findings from site visits to  		assisted living facilities in Florida, Wisconsin, and Oregon.  		<a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#conclude">Section V</a> presents our conclusions regarding policy  		issues that need to be addressed and suggestions for future research and policy  		analysis. </p>

<h2><a name="define" id="define">II. NEGOTIATED RISK AGREEMENTS: DEFINITION, CONCEPTS,  		AND USE</a></h2>
<p>The right to assume risk has long been an important topic for disability  		advocates, LTC service providers, and policy makers. The "normalization"  		movement promoted by persons with developmental disabilities and their  		advocates warns against overprotection, defining adults' right to take risks as  		a form of human dignity. Over 20 years ago, a report on mental handicap,  		nursing, and care noted that the world is not always safe, secure, and  		predictable and that "mentally handicapped people too need to assume a fair and  		prudent share of risk."<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note7">7</a></font></sup>  		Yet, choice and risk tolerance are fairly new concepts in LTC settings, with  		consumers of LTC services seeking more control over their lives by controlling  		the services they receive. At the same time, the impact of litigation in LTC  		and health care settings has made efforts to reduce or "manage" risk an  		important political, economic, and social policy issue. </p>
<p>NRAs were developed in this advocacy and litigation environment as a  		mechanism to enable older persons residing in regulated assisted living  		settings to make preferred choices, even when they entail some risk. Processes  		and documents similar to NRAs exist in health care settings--for example,  		informed consent--but the specific process and structure of NRAs are unique to  		assisted living (i.e., written documents that list): </p>
<ul><li>the behavior or resident preference of concern to the provider; </li>
<li>the potential or actual risk; </li>
<li>the resident preferences and potential provider accommodations or  		  suggested alternatives to the behavior that reduce risk while meeting resident  		  preferences; </li>
<li>a negotiated resolution; and </li>
<li>the resident's acknowledgement and acceptance of the potential  		  negative consequences of his or her actions. </li>
</ul><p>The concept of allowing residents to assume risk to promote autonomy in  		assisted living is widely recognized. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services' definition of assisted living outlined in the standard Home and  		Community Based Services waiver application includes the following statement:  		"The consumer retains the right to assume risk, tempered only by the  		individual's ability to assume responsibility for that risk."<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> This definition recognizes in  		principle the right to assume risk while acknowledging that mental capacity is  		an issue in risk assumption. </p>
<p>In 2000, the Assisted Living Federation of America issued the first  		manual for providers interested in using NRAs, which includes advice on how to  		structure NRAs, as well as their potential impact on a provider's liability if  		an injury occurs as a result of the risk assumed.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Over the past decade, NRAs have gained prominence in policy discussions  		surrounding assisted living, as evidenced by three significant legal  		articles,<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> and an  		extended debate on their merits by the Assisted Living Workgroup in 2003. (See  		<a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendE">Appendix E</a> for additional information on the Workgroup.)  		Two prominent organizations that provide voluntary accreditation to assisted  		living facilities--the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare  		Organizations and the Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission--describe risk  		agreements as part of the service planning process.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The AARP has a policy position supporting NRAs (see <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendE">Appendix E</a>) and <i>Consumer Reports</i> considers NRAs to  		be "one issue you will need to consider" when looking for an assisted living  		residence.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> In 2001,  		the Institute of Medicine recommended increased access to consumer-directed LTC  		and a related research agenda that included studies to examine the  		effectiveness of NRAs in addressing the need to balance desires for autonomy  		with concerns about safety.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>State Regulations Regarding NRAs</h3>
<p>Forty-one states have regulations that govern residential care settings  		called assisted living. The majority of states have no provisions related to  		NRAs in either statute or administrative code, leaving their use to the  		discretion of providers unless they are prohibited under other state statutes.  		Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have NRA or closely related  		provisions (<i>hereafter</i>, the states).<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Of the 15 states with NRA provisions, only Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, and  		Iowa do not reference NRAs as a distinct document that is written or signed.  		Alaska requires a discussion of risks as part of service planning, while  		Florida regulations simply define managed risk as a process that can be used  		during service planning. Hawaii requires facilities to apply a "principle of  		managed risk," defined as a formal process of negotiating and developing a plan  		to address resident needs, decisions, or preferences to reduce the probability  		of adverse outcomes for the resident and others. Iowa requires that providers  		have a process for managing risk, which must be disclosed prior to occupancy.  		</p>
<p>Iowa also requires a managed risk "statement" that tenants sign  		acknowledging "shared responsibility for identifying and meeting needs and the  		process for managing risk and upholding tenant autonomy when tenant decision  		making may result in poor outcomes for the tenant or others." Thus, although  		these four states' regulations do not specify the content or format of a risk  		agreement, they do specify that risk management be part of the service planning  		process in assisted living. </p>
<p>Wisconsin is the only state that requires all persons entering  		Residential Care Apartment Complexes (RCACs) to have an NRA at admission, even  		one that simply states that no specific risk issues have been  		identified.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> Arkansas  		regulations require the facility to "negotiate a compliance agreement" if the  		resident assessment indicates a "high probability" that the resident's choice  		or action places that person or others at risk of adverse outcomes. Oklahoma  		and Vermont require facilities to initiate a negotiation <i>process</i> when  		they determine that a resident's decision, behavior, or action places the  		resident or others at risk of harm; under the same circumstances, Washington  		requires providers to develop a formal, written negotiated plan. No state  		prohibits NRAs. See <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> for a summary of the 15  		states' regulatory provisions regarding NRAs. Assisted living industry  		representatives play an important role in interpreting state regulations on  		NRAs, including developing model NRA forms and providing training sessions for  		their provider members. </p>
<h3>Use of NRAs</h3>
<p>Two of the largest assisted living companies use NRAs as part of their  		standard operating procedures. However, no data regarding the frequency of use  		in actual settings is available, nor do we know why administrators do or do not  		choose to employ NRAs. As noted, Wisconsin mandates that all residents of RCACs  		have an NRA in place, but apart from Wisconsin, the prevalence of NRA use is  		not well known because no states monitor their use. </p>
<p>Two recent studies indicate that they may not be widely used. A recent  		survey of 200 Florida assisted living facilities with seven or more residents  		found that 6 percent use NRAs as a matter of corporate policy and 22 percent  		use them optionally.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note16">16</a></font></sup>  		A 2000 study of NRA use within a national company's 159 facilities found that  		while 50 percent of managers reported using risk agreements, only 3 percent of  		current resident files included such a document.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> A national study conducted in 1998, using a  		broad definition of assisted living, found that 29 percent of facilities use  		NRAs but did not examine the rate of NRA use within those facilities.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Experts and stakeholders in Florida and Oregon said that NRA use is low  		in their states. Some attributed the low use in Florida to provider uncertainty  		about their legal status, most likely because the state's regulations do not  		define NRAs as a document, but rather identify "managed risk" as a process  		connected to service planning. Some experts suggested that in Florida, NRAs are  		most likely used by larger facilities and corporate chains that have a policy  		mandating them. </p>
<p>Based on interviews with experts, NRA use may be low in other states as  		well. Both experts and providers in Oregon indicated a low rate of use. They  		suggested that possible reasons may include: (1) most residents not making  		choices that have a high risk for negative outcomes; (2) a policy and practice  		climate that treats the NRA as a route of last resort; and (3) uncertainty over  		the legal status of NRAs. One legal expert commenting on this latter concern  		observed that ultimately, the legal status of any contract is unknown unless  		and until there is a breach and an enforcement of the contract via judicial  		process. </p>
<p>The experts and stakeholders we consulted for this study varied in their  		views regarding provider awareness and use of NRAs. A little over half thought  		that assisted living providers' awareness of NRAs is moderate to high but that  		their interest in using NRAs is somewhat lower.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="debate" id="debate">III. THE DEBATE ABOUT NEGOTIATED RISK  		AGREEMENTS</a></h2>
<p>As assisted living has grown in popularity, NRAs have generated a great  		deal of debate among consumer advocates, providers, regulators, and LTC policy  		and legal analysts--some of it contentious. The debate includes not only the  		legal concepts underlying NRAs and the policy issues related to their use, but  		also how they should and should not be used in practice. At the most basic  		level, proponents see NRAs as a tool that is paired with assessment and service  		planning to accommodate resident choice in regulated settings, while opponents  		see it as a strategy for assisted living providers to avoid liability for poor  		care. </p>
<h3>Purpose of NRAs</h3>
<p>States and the majority of proponents believe NRAs have several  		purposes, providing: (1) a tool for identifying and reducing risks, (2) a means  		for assigning responsibility and limiting provider liability, and (3) a method  		to support residents' rights to make choices that entail risk. </p>
<p>In this section, we review the competing views regarding each of these  		conceptual purposes. It is important to note that while we discuss "proponent"  		and "opponent" views in the aggregate, not all proponents or opponents share  		each of the views ascribed to the larger group. </p>
<p>We also summarize and analyze the current legal and policy debate over  		the use of NRAs as presented in the literature and by the experts and  		stakeholders we interviewed. We begin with a discussion of views regarding the  		purposes of NRAs, followed by a discussion of liability waivers--the central  		issue that polarizes views about NRAs. We also discuss the potential role of  		the service planning process to provide some of the perceived advantages of  		NRAs, the relationship between NRAs and regulations, appropriate and  		inappropriate risks to address in an NRA, and issues related to the use of NRAs  		with cognitively impaired residents. </p>
<p><i><b>NRAs are a Tool for Identifying and Reducing Risks</b></i></p>
<p>Proponents believe that NRAs can reduce risks and lead to better overall  		outcomes by: (1) helping to identify potential risks, (2) fostering discussions  		about risk issues by residents and families, (3) looking for creative  		alternatives to lessen risks, and (4) formalizing what is usually an informal  		exchange between the provider and resident and/or family by documenting the  		facility's awareness of and efforts to address identified problems. </p>
<p>A review of the regulations in the 15 states that address NRAs indicate  		that states also perceive NRAs as a means to identify and reduce risks. For  		example, New Jersey states that the purpose of "managed risk" agreements is to  		avoid or reduce the risk of adverse outcomes through a process that balances  		resident choice and independence with the need to assure the health and safety  		of the resident and other persons in the facility. The District of Columbia  		states that the purpose of "shared responsibility" agreements is to provide a  		process to deal with disagreements, wherein the resident or their surrogate and  		the facility together determine an acceptable balance between the resident's  		desire for independence and the facility's legitimate concerns for safety. </p>
<p>The strongest opponents tend to view NRAs as having a sole purpose--an  		attempt to avoid liability for negative outcomes. Others recognize that "good"  		providers may use NRAs to identify and reduce risks, but fear that "bad"  		providers will use them to force residents to accept substandard care because  		they have no practical alternative or fear discharge to an institutional  		setting. Several argue that residents are in an unequal bargaining position due  		to frailty, lack of acceptable alternatives, and the difficulty with  		relocation. </p>
<p>While both proponents and opponents of NRAs expressed concerns about  		unequal bargaining positions, they were divided regarding the ability to  		mitigate the potential negative consequences through law and regulation.  		Opponents believe that prohibiting NRAs altogether rather than risking abuse  		best serves the public interest; proponents believe the public interest is best  		served by allowing NRAs and implementing regulatory protections. </p>
<p><i><b>NRAs are a Means to Assign Responsibility and Limit Provider  		Liability</b></i></p>
<p>Some experts believe NRAs are a strategy for implementing the assisted  		living philosophy of resident autonomy, rather than the traditional model of  		"imposed protection" by mitigating "law-related anxiety."<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> They see them as a practical  		strategy for working within an "intimidating malpractice and regulatory climate  		that pervades health care delivery" to overcome provider policies--some legally  		imposed--that limit resident choice and risk assumption in order to assure  		safety. NRAs help give providers the comfort they need to allow exceptions to  		these policies when they conflict with a resident's preference. Some also  		assert the need and right of providers for liability protection if residents  		are afforded the autonomy to choose not to follow staff's advice and, as a  		result, experience a negative outcome. However, none believe that NRAs should  		ever include a blanket waiver of liability. </p>
<p>Only a few experts believe that NRAs, even with explicit waivers of  		liability, can limit provider liability if negligence is involved. Nonetheless,  		even if the potential liability limitation is more a perception than a reality,  		some see it as an advantage because without it providers will not be  		comfortable tolerating behavior that they have identified as risky. Several  		people we interviewed referred to a culture of "liability anxiety" in LTC  		settings as a major force driving provider activities. One provider commented,  		"The reality in this industry is lawsuits." </p>
<p>Several attorneys we interviewed specifically discussed NRAs as a  		valuable liability reduction tool whether or not they include liability  		waivers. They noted that family members are less likely to sue for bad outcomes  		if they are included in an NRA process and, as a result, have a good  		relationship with the provider and understand the provider's efforts to  		minimize risk and maximize safety while at the same time honoring their  		relative's desire for autonomy. </p>
<p>A policy expert suggested that residents and their families would be  		unlikely to sue if they believed the provider was genuinely working with them  		to provide care the way they and their relative wanted it delivered. He also  		noted that juries would see the NRA document as evidence that the provider  		cared about outcomes and acted responsibly to alert the resident to risks,  		provide alternatives, and respect the resident's preference. Despite evidence  		that early discussions about negotiated risk included liability relief as a  		component of the negotiated risk concept,<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note21">21</a></font></sup> there appears to be a recent shift among  		some proponents away from including liability waivers in the  		agreements.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note22">22</a></font></sup> It is not  		clear how the absence of liability waivers will impact provider adoption of  		NRAs. </p>
<p>Concerns about liability waivers are the primary reason consumer  		advocates from the legal profession oppose the use of NRAs, though they are  		joined by other consumer advocates, regulators, and some providers. Several  		claim that the sole or primary purpose of NRAs is to provide a  		mechanism--through a waiver--for facilities to avoid liability for substandard,  		inadequate, or negligent care. They see NRAs as a dangerous and unfair practice  		through which older persons are pressured or tricked into waiving the facility  		of all liability and fear that proponents are naïve when they argue  		otherwise.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> They  		believe NRAs will be abused to allow providers to under-staff facilities and  		retain inappropriate residents in an effort to boost profits.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>These views are based in part on the published statements of providers  		(e.g., a trade association publication referred to NRAs as "one piece of a  		liability reduction strategy,"<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> and a recent article on NRAs asserted that  		"at bottom," NRAs are a way "of releasing facilities from  		liability.")<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Ohio specifically addresses whether a resident can choose to remain in  		an assisted living facility that does not offer services the resident needs,  		stating "if a resident requires certain personal care services that the  		residential care facility does not offer, the facility shall comply with  		paragraph (G) of rule 3701-17-58 of the Administrative Code,<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note27">27</a></font></sup> and the facility or the  		resident shall arrange for the services to be provided; or the facility shall  		transfer the resident to an appropriate setting or discharge the  		resident; or the facility and the resident may enter into a risk  		agreementif the facility has a policy of entering into such agreements."  		</p>
<p>Opponents do not accept that abuse of liability waivers can be limited  		through regulation and oversight. Most oppose NRAs even if they do not include  		any reference to the provider's liability, believing NRAs will suppress  		lawsuits for negligent provider actions because residents and their families  		will feel that they have given up their right to sue. This perspective is  		reflected in a recent policy statement from the National Senior Citizens Law  		Center that opposes any use of NRAs in assisted living.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note28">28</a></font></sup> Proponents have countered that unscrupulous  		providers could attempt to inhibit residents from pursuing lawsuits regardless  		of whether NRAs had been used. </p>
<p>Some state regulations use language regarding residents' assumption of  		risk, which suggests that the provider is afforded some liability protection in  		the event of a negative outcome. Wisconsin's regulations express this most  		clearly, by requiring that every resident in a RCAC have a signed, jointly NRA  		at the time of admission "as a protection for both the individual tenant <i>and  		the residential care apartment complex</i>" (emphasis added). Nonetheless,  		Wisconsin specifically states that a risk agreement may not waive other  		regulatory provisions or "any other right of the tenant," presumably including  		the right to sue in the event of a bad outcome. </p>
<p>Only four of the 15 states with NRA regulatory provisions specifically  		prohibit the use of NRAs as a liability waiver in some or all instances.  		Vermont states that "negotiated risk does not constitute a waiver of  		liability." Delaware states that facilities "shall make no attempt to use the  		managed/negotiated risk portion of the service agreement to abridge a  		resident's rights or to avoid liability for harm caused to a resident by the  		negligence of the assisted living facility and any such abridgement or  		disclaimer shall be void." Washington prohibits facilities from requiring or  		asking residents or their representatives to sign any contract or agreement,  		including a negotiated service or risk agreement, "that purports to waive any  		rights of the resident or that purports to place responsibility or liability  		for losses of personal property or injury on the resident." </p>
<p>New Jersey has the strongest language, stating that "any provision or  		clause waiving or limiting the right to sue for negligence or malpractice in  		any admission agreement or contract between a patient and a nursing home or  		assisted living facility, whether executed prior to, on or after the effective  		date of this act, is hereby declared to be void as against public policy and  		wholly unenforceable, and shall not constitute a defense in any action, suit or  		proceeding." </p>
<p><i><b>NRAs Provide a Means to Support Residents' Rights</b></i></p>
<p>Proponents, including some consumer advocates, believe that the defined  		negotiation process contained in NRAs, and any training that accompanies their  		use, raises staff and families' understanding of residents' rights to assume  		risk. They also feel that NRAs create a process that facilitates residents',  		their families', and staffs' advocacy for residents' choices even when others  		may view their choices as risky. Several experts thought the NRA process could  		encourage providers to support resident choice because the process itself might  		help them realize that some of their concerns are vague and do not warrant the  		restrictions imposed on the resident. </p>
<p>NRAs are seen as a useful process to help residents and providers come  		to agreement when a resident's desired course of action or continued occupancy  		is allowed by regulations but seen as risky by the provider. Experts also noted  		a potential role for NRAs in enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act  		(ADA) and Fair Housing Amendments, such as when courts require a provider or  		the state to craft a "reasonable accommodation" for a person with disabilities  		(young or old) to a broad admission or discharge requirement. The role that  		NRAs could play would be either to: </p>
<ul><li>provide a process for addressing specific concerns once a court rules  		  that a reasonable accommodation is required, or </li>
<li>provide a process within state law or regulations that gives  		  residents the ability to supersede provider or state-ordered admission or  		  discharge requirements under certain circumstances. </li>
</ul><p>As one legal expert noted regarding "reasonable accommodation," NRAs  		could help resolve the inherent conflict in the law between a desire to protect  		individuals' with disabilities rights to choice and autonomy and the  		government's interest in implementing minimum standards for LTC providers  		through enforceable uniform requirements and proscribed processes and  		procedures. </p>
<p>The experts we interviewed believe that the two main advantages NRAs  		offer are a formal process that educates consumers and staff about residents'  		rights to assume risk, even when staff and families disagree, and a mechanism  		for residents to document and enforce risk-taking decisions without fear of  		being asked to move out. An expert in LTC policy and nursing home litigation  		interviewed for this paper explained that in a "litigation-charged atmosphere,"  		NRAs are a tool that can both protect the facility through documentation of an  		agreement or, potentially, an explicit waiver that allows greater autonomy for  		residents. She emphasized that NRAs are not about "shirking responsibility" but  		rather are a realistic approach to working within what another expert described  		as an "ageist" social and policy culture that thinks older persons need to be  		protected. </p>
<p>Some proponents believe that NRAs are a necessary strategy to allow  		residents to maintain autonomy in residential care settings that are  		intentionally different from heavily regulated nursing facilities.  		Specifically, while they recognize that assisted living is a licensed setting  		with expectations for quality of care that protects the well-being of  		residents, it is conceived and embraced as a consumer-driven model that  		attempts to balance the rights of older adults to retain the autonomy to make  		their own decisions. </p>
<p>Opponents give little credence to the fear that providers will limit  		choice in the absence of a risk agreement. Many believe that residents in  		regulated care settings should not be allowed to choose to remain in a setting  		that cannot meet their needs. These opponents maintain that residents should  		not have this choice even if the resident is prepared to forego the services or  		find alternative ways to meet their needs because they cannot make good  		decisions in these situations due to a variety of factors, including emotional  		and financial distress, provider manipulations, and a lack of appropriate  		information and expertise. </p>
<p>Predictably, NRA proponents view this attitude as paternalistic. One  		legal expert noted that the logical extension of this reasoning could be to  		deny all potentially vulnerable persons or their surrogates the right to choose  		because of a perceived risk of a negative outcome or abuse. </p>
<p>When asked about the potential role of NRAs in assuring residents'  		ability to assume risk in pursuit of preferred choices, some opponents stated  		that residents do not lose legal rights when they enter assisted living or  		other LTC settings. Instead, they expressed strong opinions that NRAs were not  		the answer to protecting or expanding the rights of consumers in LTC; rather  		better enforcement of existing rights is needed (e.g., the right to refuse  		treatment or a recommended plan of care). In fact, these advocates expressed  		deep concerns that NRAs provide a vehicle to limit the existing rights of  		residents by creating an atmosphere that suggests that residents must negotiate  		a compromise to follow a preferred course. </p>
<p>Proponents do not accept this argument and observe that providers have  		traditionally limited residents' choices or preferences through legally  		enforceable program policies enumerated in the contract, and through subtle or  		not so subtle coercion (e.g., by telling residents if they do not comply with  		facility policy they will be discharged). These limitations are driven,  		proponents argue, by well-meaning paternalism, liability concerns, and measures  		providers believe to be necessary to comply with state regulations. One legal  		expert noted that residents' rights in assisted living and other LTC settings  		depend to a great degree on state law. If the state does not apply  		landlord-tenant law to assisted living, the provider may, in effect, be the law  		and absent an NRA, residents may have no way to insist that their preferences  		be honored. </p>
<p>Several states believe that one of the primary purposes of an NRA is to  		assure residents' rights. For example, Oregon's rules state that residents are  		to be given "informed choice and opportunity to select or refuse service and to  		accept responsibility for the consequences." Washington states that a resident  		has a right to "take responsibility for the risks associated with  		decision-making" and that residents are permitted to refuse any particular  		service "unless adjudged incompetent or otherwise found to be legally  		incapacitated to direct his or her own service plan and changes in the service  		plan," and "so long as such refusal is documented in the record of the  		resident." </p>
<p>Illinois has the strongest statement of a resident's right to assume  		risk, stating a resident has the right "to direct his or her own care and  		negotiate the terms of his or her own care," and "to refuse services unless  		such services are court ordered or the health, safety, or welfare of other  		individuals is endangered by the refusal, and to be advised of the consequences  		of that refusal." </p>
<h3>Ability of NRAs to Limit Liability</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, the inclusion of liability waivers in  		NRAs--specific or implied--is the main issue that polarizes views about NRAs.  		Some proponents claim that NRAs are not and never were intended to limit  		provider liability while other proponents argue that they were always intended  		to create a balance within a regulated setting, allowing resident autonomy by  		providing an appropriate amount of liability protection for providers. The  		early literature on NRAs includes discussions of the importance of limiting  		liability in order to accommodate resident choice.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note29">29</a></font></sup> Many continue to argue that without limiting  		provider liability that could result from residents' risky choices, providers  		will continue to restrict residents' autonomy in favor of safety.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> Some proponents note that while  		it may be appropriate for providers to ask residents to waive liability  		specific to outcomes connected to a defined resident choice, blanket waivers of  		liability are never appropriate. </p>
<p>An interesting feature of the debate about NRAs and liability waivers is  		that few proponents <i>or</i> opponents believe that NRAs can effectively limit  		legal liability, whether or not they include a specific liability waiver.  		Virtually no one believes that broad liability waivers are enforceable due to  		several legal precedents and principles, including the duty to provide an  		acceptable standard of care, the inability to waive liability resulting from  		negligence, and certain principles of contract law (e.g., unequal bargaining  		power).<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The enforceability of a liability waiver regarding a specific behavior  		is also questioned, with the majority believing "it depends." In the course of  		our interviews, we heard about only four legal cases involving NRAs or related  		issues. An expert cited a Florida case involving an NRA, but was not able to  		provide details. Of two cases identified in Virginia, one had a sealed  		settlement that could not be discussed. The other involved an NRA that  		addressed the risk of falls and a bad outcome, and was dismissed because of the  		written NRA, suggesting that the NRA did afford some liability protection. </p>
<p>When NRAs follow a carefully designed process and include a narrow  		liability waiver based on residents' explicit choices, some experts believe  		they could be enforceable and limit provider liability for negative  		consequences stemming from the named choice. </p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Taken together, the well established legal principles of informed  		  consent, assumption of risk, and comparative negligence suggest that a resident  		  or his legal representative who is able to understand and express his  		  preferences, and who has been fully informed of and understands the attendant  		  risks, would be held to the choices he made, including the decision to assume  		  the risks of a negative or harmful outcome. Adding support to the prediction  		  that negotiated risk agreements, when properly used, will be supported by the  		  courts is the fact that a number of states expressly refer to negotiated risk  		  agreements in their licensing regulations for assisted living."</i><sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who believe NRAs could mitigate liability acknowledge that this  		view is untested in case law.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> One legal review article concluded that NRAs  		are not inherently unenforceable contracts but that their enforceability  		depends on state law (e.g., assisted living regulations, public policy, legal  		treatment of negligence and assumption of risk, and contract law), as well as  		the particular facts and circumstances addressed in the NRA and the process  		used to execute it. Given this, the enforceability of NRAs could be enhanced by  		constructing and implementing the agreement in accordance with the specific  		principles underlying enforceable contracts in that jurisdiction.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note34">34</a></font></sup></p>
<p>While their enforceability may be in question, some believe that NRAs  		can still serve a useful function in defending against a lawsuit, by  		demonstrating that staff had identified and addressed risks with the resident,  		provided options, and honored the resident's choice. An attorney who advises  		assisted living providers commented that, though NRAs remain untested in the  		courts, if it came to a lawsuit, the NRA would be "exhibit number one."  		Clearly, the use of an NRA as a defense would necessitate an examination of the  		specific circumstances. A situation in which the provider had adequate staff  		and offered assistance that the resident refused would likely be viewed  		differently than one where the provider was incapable of meeting the resident's  		needs and the resident signed a liability waiver to avoid being discharged.  		</p>
<p>None of the experts believe that liability waivers would be enforceable  		when negligence resulted in harm to a resident or if providers violated express  		regulatory requirements. Several NRA opponents did note, however, that even if  		unenforceable, liability waivers could dissuade residents and their families  		from initiating valid legal actions when they believe that the provider has  		been negligent. </p>
<h3>NRAs and State Admission and Discharge Requirements</h3>
<p>Several opponents believe that providers will use NRAs to allow  		residents to remain at the facility after their needs exceed regulatory  		discharge requirements--sidestepping regulations in an effort to maintain their  		facility's census without increasing staffing. The consensus of legal experts  		was that NRAs or any private contracts, as a general rule, can not overrule  		regulations or law because deregulation by private contract is not enforceable.  		Nor can NRAs supplant a provider's fulfillment of a statutory duty.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Some states explicitly prohibit the use of NRAs to override state  		mandated discharge requirements. For example, Arkansas prohibits the use of an  		NRA to permit residents to remain in a facility if their condition violates a  		state-mandated discharge trigger. Delaware prohibits the use of a risk  		agreement as a means "to retain residents whose needs the facility cannot meet,  		or to supersede any other regulatory requirements." </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it appears that NRAs and similar agreements can be  		specifically included in regulations as a mechanism to allow residents to  		accept risks within parameters established by regulations or as a defined  		mechanism with which to override state discharge requirements under certain  		circumstances. In other words, residents do not have a right to use NRAs to  		enforce their choices in opposition to the state's (or, generally, the  		provider's) rules unless the state explicitly provides in law or regulation for  		NRAs to do so. </p>
<p>For example, Ohio's assisted living regulations specifically allow  		residents to use NRAs when they meet state residency criteria and want to  		remain at the facility but the facility does not offer services to meet some of  		their needs or they choose to decline services. Ohio regulations state that a  		provider must "provide personal care services to its residents who require  		those services, unless the resident and the facility have entered into a risk  		agreementor the resident has refused services." Furthermore, "if a  		resident requires certain personal care services that the residential care  		facility does not offer, the facilityor the resident shall arrange for  		the services to be provided; or the facility shall transfer the resident to an  		appropriate setting or discharge the resident; or the facility and the resident  		may enter into a risk agreement if the facility has a policy of entering into  		such agreements." </p>
<p>A Michigan law goes further, allowing assisted living residents to  		assert their choice to remain in assisted living under certain circumstances,  		even if they exceed state-mandated discharge requirements. Enacted in 2001, in  		response to an ADA lawsuit, the law specifically gives consumers the ability to  		override state discharge requirements for assisted living if they can reach  		agreement with the provider, their physician, and their family about how they  		will receive necessary services. </p>
<blockquote><p><i>Sec. 21325. If a resident of a home for the aged is receiving care  		  in the facility in addition to the room, board, and supervised personal care  		  specified in section 20106(3), as determined by a physician, the department  		  shall not order the removal of the resident from the home for the aged if both  		  of the following conditions are met: (a) The resident, the resident's family,  		  the resident's physician, and the owner, operator, and governing body of the  		  home for the aged consent to the resident's continued stay in the home for the  		  aged. (b) The owner, operator, and governing body of the home for the aged  		  commit to assuring that the resident receives the necessary additional  		  services.</i><sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Texas and Louisiana have passed similar legislation. However, none of  		these three states defines NRAs in regulation. </p>
<p><i><b>Conflicts Between Discharge Regulations and Federal  		Anti-Discrimination Laws </b></i></p>
<p>Several experts believe that while NRAs cannot override regulations  		without explicit state authority to do so, they may serve a useful role in  		crafting "reasonable accommodations" settlements when state and provider  		admission and discharge criteria are successfully challenged using federal and  		state disability law; for example, the ADA of 1990, the Fair Housing Act (FHA)  		of 1968 and its subsequent amendments, Fair Housing Amendments Act  		(FHAA).<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Case law establishes that, under specific circumstances, individuals  		with disabilities and their surrogates can successfully challenge state or  		provider-mandated admission and discharge requirements when they are overly  		broad and found, as a result, to be discriminatory. NRAs could play a role in  		settling these suits, providing a tool to address residents' and providers'  		concerns about autonomy, safety, and liability. </p>
<p>On the other hand, NRA opponents argue that when regulations limit  		choices protected by the ADA, FHA, and FHAA then the regulations need to be  		changed rather than using an NRA to override them. This argument assumes that  		regulations can be modified in ways that will protect residents who do not want  		to take risks while allowing choice for those who do--without the use of NRAs.  		NRA proponents question whether such an approach is feasible. </p>
<p>The core concern that opponents express regarding the use of NRAs to  		override discharge criteria is that this practice would allow residents to stay  		in a facility with less service capacity than they need while releasing  		providers from any obligation to meet their needs. Opponents fear that some  		residents lack an understanding of what services they need and the consequences  		of doing without them. Opponents also worry that some residents will make bad  		decisions to avoid a move. </p>
<p>Opponents worry that this lack of understanding or a strong reluctance  		to move (especially to a nursing home) will embolden providers to use NRAs to  		increase profits by cutting staffing and services without risking liability or  		a loss in occupancy. With NRAs potentially relieving providers of the general  		regulatory requirement to ensure residents' health and safety (i.e., meet all  		the needs of an individual resident), opponents believe that many providers  		will use their unequal bargaining power to threaten discharge if a resident  		will not accept fewer services than they need and waive the provider's  		liability. They also worry that the use of NRAs will leave even surveyors  		powerless to ensure quality care and safety. For example: </p>
<blockquote><p><i>"When surveyors threaten state sanctions [due to inadequate  		  staffing and services to meet residents' needs], the facilities cite [NRAs] as  		  justification for residents' rights to choose inadequate care and concurrently  		  to release facilities from liability from any harm which may befall the  		  resident as a result of such inadequate careAs mentioned above,  		  negotiated risk puts residents' health and safety at risk."</i><sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>States have an option other than NRAs to allow residents to stay in a  		facility after they exceed discharge requirements: they can issue a waiver  		allowing the resident to remain if certain conditions are met. However, since  		these waivers are provided at the discretion of state regulators, many argue  		that they do not replace the need for measures to enhance residents' ability to  		challenge state or provider mandated discharge. </p>
<h3>Service Plans as an Alternative to NRAs</h3>
<p>States' views vary regarding differences between NRAs and service plans.  		Nine of the 15 states that include NRAs or similar concepts in regulation  		define them as a component of service planning or create some linkage between  		them and service plans. Most states, however, do not reference NRAs or require  		a similar process in regulations prescribing the service planning process. </p>
<p>NRA opponents believe that any potential benefits NRAs offer can be  		obtained through the use of comprehensive and thorough service plans or a  		specialized service planning process as an addendum to the regular service  		plan. Even some NRA proponents believe NRAs will not provide any greater  		liability protection than would a comprehensive service plan that included the  		same information. </p>
<p>Others disagree, stating that risk agreements are not synonymous with  		service plans, serving complementary but distinct purposes. They believe that  		service plans are based on a physical, medical, and social assessment of the  		resident and specify services deemed necessary by a physician and/or nurse to  		be delivered in accordance with resident preferences. In contrast, NRAs are  		used when a resident wants to deviate from the service plan or to address  		"lifestyle" issues not typically covered in service plans. They also believe  		that NRAs offer a unique process that requires providers and residents to  		discuss the consequences of choosing to take a risk, a discussion not typically  		present in service planning. </p>
<p>Legal analysts also argue that if the NRA is to be an enforceable  		contract it needs to be a distinct agreement: "To the extent that a resident  		and provider intend to reach a definitive agreement concerning a certain risk,  		the typical service plan is not designed to be an enforceable contract by  		itself and often lacks necessary elements for a binding contract such as  		mutuality of consideration."<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note39">39</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Several experts noted that nothing precludes a facility from using  		specialized forms as addendums to service plans to document discussions about  		risk issues that pertain to services--for example, dietary noncompliance--and  		to record providers' suggestions and residents' choices. The key differences  		would be that such forms would simply document that the resident is aware of  		the risks and chooses to assume them without addressing liability and the  		elements of a distinct negotiation would be absent. NRAs on the other hand,  		when viewed as a <i>contract</i> would require the resident to either  		implicitly waive provider liability by stating she assumes responsibility for  		the consequences of her action, or explicitly waive provider liability for any  		negative result of her choice. </p>
<h3>Types of Risk Considered Appropriate for NRAs</h3>
<p>An important issue for both proponents and opponents is whether  		residents should have an unfettered right to choose to do what they want while  		living in an assisted living setting. While competent residents have the legal  		right to refuse treatment and the advice of a provider concerning safety  		concerns, providers are obligated to maintain standards of care and may, under  		certain circumstances, legitimately curtail or discharge residents if the  		provider feels their behaviors pose too great a risk. Wisconsin's regulations  		uphold this right, stating that while neither the tenant nor the facility shall  		refuse to accept reasonable risk, neither shall they insist that the other  		party accept unreasonable risk (no guidance is provided on what constitutes  		reasonable or unreasonable risk.) </p>
<p>Proponents and opponents also question whether there are certain  		behaviors that should never be the subject of negotiation. We asked the experts  		and stakeholders consulted for this study about their views on appropriate and  		inappropriate types of risks to be included in an NRA. In general, most  		indicated that a determination of whether a risk was appropriate or  		inappropriate would require a consideration of the physical and mental  		condition of the resident, the type and degree of risk, and the severity of  		potential negative outcomes. </p>
<p>About a third believed that any type of risky behavior that residents  		could pursue in their own home would be appropriate for an NRA.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note40">40</a></font></sup> Some identified one or more  		areas that they believed were always inappropriate for an NRA, including  		behaviors that put other residents and staff at risk of harm and those  		prohibited by law or regulation. However, some experts indicated that minimal  		risk to others or those entailing only minor consequences might be acceptable.  		</p>
<p>Within the category of risks that might affect others, views on smoking  		varied. Some believed it is a non-negotiable topic and should not be allowed if  		it poses any risk, while others felt that it could be addressed in an NRA under  		certain circumstances, for example, specifying that a person is allowed to  		smoke only in designated areas or under staff or family supervision. Some felt  		smoking restrictions should be specified in a facility's rules, in which case  		they would not be an appropriate topic for an NRA since all residents are  		expected to comply with them. </p>
<p>We asked the experts to provide their views on using an NRA in three  		hypothetical cases: overriding discharge criteria regarding ability to  		self-evacuate, refusing medications, and refusing to use a walker. The response  		categories and number of experts in each are listed in <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#table1">Table  		1</a>. </p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>Overriding Discharge Criteria Regarding Self-Evacuation</b></i>.  		While many believe that NRAs should not and could not be used to allow  		residents to remain in a setting when they no longer meet regulatory discharge  		requirements, a little less than half said "it depends." Potential solutions  		proposed to address such a situation include revising regulations that are  		overly prescriptive and allowing regulatory waivers. For example, states that  		require residents to be able to self-evacuate might issue a waiver allowing an  		individual to stay as long as the facility could demonstrate that the staff  		could evacuate him (e.g., by placing him in a room on the first floor closest  		to an exit). </p>
<p><b><i>Refusing Medications</i></b>. Experts were divided on whether an  		NRA should be used if residents refuse to take prescribed medication. Some felt  		that refusing any type of care, including medications, was an appropriate issue  		for an NRA while others stated that residents have a right to refuse  		medications and so an NRA is not necessary. Others believed that the  		appropriateness of an NRA would depend on the type of medication, physician  		input, and the severity of potential negative outcomes. For example, a refusal  		to take insulin should not be allowed, whereas a refusal to take blood pressure  		medications might be allowed, depending on the circumstances. </p>
<p><b><i>Refusing to Use a Walker</i></b>. Most experts agreed that an NRA  		would be appropriate if a resident refused to use a walker even though her  		physician and physical therapist stated that she was at high risk for falling  		if she does not. A few disagreed, noting that all health care settings,  		including hospitals and nursing facilities, grant patients the right to refuse  		medical advice, and a resident should not have to negotiate or release a  		facility from liability to exercise this right. Three state LTC ombudsmen  		argued that this issue is best addressed in service planning. </p>
<p>In summary, the only behaviors that everyone agreed would be  		inappropriate were those that posed a significant risk to others. In other  		cases, opinions were divided. Most agreed that a determination of  		appropriateness depended on unique circumstances. Florida is the only state  		that specifies an appropriate/permitted topic--residents' refusal to comply  		with prescribed diets. Several providers noted they would welcome more guidance  		from states on this issue, particularly Wisconsin providers who are mandated to  		use NRAs with all residents. </p>
<h3>Determining and Reassessing Cognitive Function and  		Capacity</h3>
<p>Three studies of the prevalence of dementia among assisted living  		residents found rates of 12-66 percent.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note41">41</a></font></sup> It is likely that a significant portion of  		residents without a diagnosis of dementia also have cognitive impairment. The  		high prevalence of cognitive impairment among assisted living residents raises  		a number of policy issues related to the use of NRAs with this population,  		including: (1) whether providers are accurately identifying individuals with  		impaired decision-making capacity; (2) whether informal assessments  		underestimate or overestimate a resident's capacity to assume risk; (3) whether  		mandatory assessments of competence should be required for assisted living  		residents prior to executing an NRA and what the civil rights implications of  		such a requirement are; (4) whether guardians and powers of attorney should  		have the authority to enter into NRAs on residents' behalf; and (5) whether an  		NRA should remain valid if a resident subsequently loses the mental capacity to  		understand the consequences of their actions. </p>
<p>Only seven of the 15 states' regulations specifically address residents'  		capacity or ability to understand an NRA. Oregon's rules specify that  		facilities may not enter into or continue a risk plan with or on behalf of  		residents who are unable to recognize the consequences of their behavior or  		choices. Wisconsin prohibits persons with cognitive impairment from moving into  		a RCAC unless that person moves in with a spouse or relative who is formally  		designated to sign an NRA on his or her behalf.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note42">42</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Wisconsin's regulations state that "incapable of making care decisions"  		means that individuals are unable to understand their own needs for supportive,  		personal, or nursing services; to choose what, if any, services they want to  		receive to meet those needs; and to understand the outcome likely to result  		from that choice. The regulations specifically clarify that the term  		"incapable" refers to the ability to make a decision and not to the content or  		result of the decision. </p>
<p>The other five states reference capacity but do not provide specific  		guidance. For example, Alaska and New Jersey require that NRAs be explained or  		written in "understandable language." Arkansas requires facilities to have  		written proof that residents or their "responsible parties" are making an  		informed decision, but do not specify how that proof is to be obtained.  		Florida's rules permit the admission and retention of persons with dementia in  		Extended Congregate Care (ECC) facilities, but have no provisions for written  		NRAs. None of the 15 states with regulations pertaining to NRAs or related  		concepts specify or require a method for assessing residents' capacity to make  		decisions. </p>
<p>We asked experts and stakeholders a number of questions related to  		mental capacity: (1) whether facilities should perform a formal assessment to  		determine residents' mental capacity to participate in an NRA process, and if  		so, whether they should use a uniform method for determining and reassessing  		mental capacity; (2) how capacity is currently assessed; (3) whether an NRA  		should be invalidated if a resident declines cognitively after signing it; and  		(4) whether family members and legal surrogates should be able to negotiate and  		sign on a resident's behalf. </p>
<p>Experts and stakeholders were uncertain if or how assisted living  		providers assess residents' capacity. Most believed that a combination of  		methods and sources of information, mostly informal, are likely used, including  		a physician or other health care provider's assessment and observations by the  		resident's family and staff. Several noted that capacity could vary based on  		time of day, as well as physical and psychological factors. Florida regulators  		noted that a physician's assessment is required for all ECC residents on an  		annual basis and that part of the required assessment is the physician's  		opinion regarding the resident's cognitive capacity. </p>
<p>Several agreed that providers should assess the resident's capacity to  		understand the nature and consequences of an agreement, particularly if staff  		suspect a resident is incapable of consenting. Several consumer advocates  		object to assessing decision-making capacity before executing NRAs, citing the  		legal principle of presumed competence unless there is evidence to the  		contrary. They view the assumption of competence as critical to preserving  		residents' rights. However, given the high prevalence of cognitive impairment  		among assisted living residents, others argue that a presumption of competence  		may be a flawed approach. </p>
<p>Studies of informed consent that used global measures of capacity  		demonstrated a range of capacity among the study population based on the  		setting, suggesting that subsets of older populations may need a formal  		evaluation of decision-making capacity before entering into agreements  		requiring informed consent.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note43">43</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One provider noted the lack of a formal process for determining mental  		capacity, but said that staff members "can tell" if a resident is not capable  		of understanding the consequences of a choice. If the resident is deemed not  		capable, this provider includes family members in discussions of choice and  		potential risk. </p>
<p>Of the 26 experts and stakeholders asked whether facilities should use a  		standard method to assess residents' capacity to participate in an NRA process,  		eight said yes, 13 no, and five were uncertain. Several referenced barriers  		such as the lack of universally accepted assessment tools and practical  		realities such as cost, staff training, and reliability across different  		settings. Many felt that even without a formal method, providers "should know"  		if a resident is cognitively impaired and if the resident has the capacity to  		make a decision in a specific area. Several noted that residents with cognitive  		impairment can retain decisional capacity in some areas, and so a determination  		of cognitive impairment should not preclude the use of NRAs in all situations.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Allowing Third Parties to Negotiate a Risk Agreement</b></i></p>
<p>Eleven of the 15 states with regulatory guidance on NRAs indicate that a  		"responsible party" may sign a risk agreement as a proxy for the  		resident--Alaska, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Iowa,  		New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Wisconsin. None prohibit proxy  		signatures for NRAs. Some states require that this person be a guardian or an  		individual with an activated power of attorney. The others do not specify legal  		requirements for responsible parties. Some states reference surrogate decision  		makers but do not define them. </p>
<p>Other states include provisions regarding the involvement of third  		parties such as guardians or "legal representatives" but do not give them  		authority to sign an NRA. For example, Vermont's regulations state that the  		provider shall initiate the negotiated risk process by notifying the resident  		and, if applicable, the legal representative, verbally and in writing. New  		Jersey requires the resident to agree to involve the resident's family or  		representative in the NRA process but does not require that anyone sign the NRA  		document. </p>
<p>Most experts believed that if residents exhibit behavior that raises  		concerns about their competence, a legal surrogate, including both family and  		non-family representatives, should be allowed to sign an NRA on their behalf as  		long as the surrogate has been designated in advance and is acting in the  		resident's best interest. When legally responsible parties are allowed to sign  		for an impaired resident, some attorneys caution that providers will need to  		determine if the third party is acting in the resident's best interest and  		intervene if they believe the decisions are motivated by other considerations.  		For example, a family member could insist on an NRA to allow a refusal of  		medication administration services because of their cost, not because the  		resident wanted to self-administer medications. </p>
<p>Others said the appropriateness of involving surrogates depends on the  		severity and imminence of the risk posed. For example, the guardian of a  		resident with severe dementia who wanders and has gotten lost many times should  		not be allowed to sign an NRA that allows the resident to take unaccompanied  		walks. A state agency employee felt strongly that allowing another person to  		sign an NRA for an incompetent resident "nullifies the entire point of the  		managed risk concept as a way of making choices and accepting consequences."  		Some agreed, stating that the NRA philosophy precludes third-party involvement.  		</p>
<p>Others felt that family members and other designated representatives  		should be allowed to sign an NRA accepting risks regarding behaviors that they  		know are important to their relative's quality of life, especially if the  		responsible party was familiar with the resident's preference before he or she  		became impaired. For example, a daughter might decide that since her diabetic  		mother had regular ice cream each night before becoming cognitively impaired  		she should be able to continue after she becomes impaired. Another example  		might be if a husband knows that his cognitively impaired spouse becomes  		depressed if she cannot take walks outside the facility, he may want to sign an  		NRA that allows her to continue, accepting the risk that his wife might fall or  		get lost. Knowing his wife well, the husband may view the negative impact of  		depression for his wife as a greater and more immanent risk than the risk of  		falling or getting lost. </p>
<p>Experts varied in their opinions about who should be involved if no  		legal representative has been designated or is available. </p>
<p><i><b>Should an NRA be Invalidated if the Resident's Mental Capacity  		Later Declines? </b></i></p>
<p>Seven states specify when or how to review NRAs. Alaska requires that  		risks associated with resident choices be documented in the service plan, which  		must be reviewed quarterly for residents who receive health-related services  		and annually for those who do not. Similarly, Washington rules link risks to  		the service agreement, which must be reviewed semiannually. Oregon requires  		assisted living providers to review risk agreements "at least quarterly."  		Arkansas, Delaware, and Illinois rules do not specify a specific time frame,  		instead stating that the agreement should include the review schedule, if any.  		</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, providers must update the risk agreement "when the  		tenant's condition or service needs change in a way that may affect risk" as  		indicated in the resident's comprehensive assessment or service plan. Many  		experts and stakeholders agreed with Wisconsin's approach, but also felt that  		NRAs should also be reviewed at regular intervals. </p>
<p>Nearly all agreed that providers need to determine whether or not an NRA  		should remain valid when residents experience a cognitive decline or a change  		in condition that increases the imminence or severity of potential  		consequences. However, their opinions regarding what providers should do varied  		considerably. Some felt the NRA should not remain valid when a resident no  		longer recalls the agreement or understands the consequences. Others felt it  		would depend on several factors, including the resident's physical and mental  		condition, the issue covered in the risk agreement, and the type, likelihood,  		and severity of potential harm. For example, an NRA requiring a woman with  		diabetes to alert staff when she eats sweets so staff can adjust her insulin  		should be invalidated if the woman is no longer able to alert staff. </p>
<p>Oregon is one state that explicitly addresses this issue in its  		regulations, stating that a managed risk plan shall not be entered into <i>or  		continued</i> with or on behalf of residents unable to recognize the  		consequences of their behavior or choices. However, it is possible that a  		resident could sign an NRA and specify that she wants it to remain in force  		even if she declines cognitively and is unable to make an informed decision.  		</p>
<p>In sum, views regarding a range of issues related to residents' capacity  		to execute NRAs varied considerably and in some cases, opposing views were  		quite contentious. Some believe that residents with diminished capacity should  		not execute an NRA, while others believe that residents with diminished  		capacity, or their legal representatives, should be able to make decisions  		regarding risks and preferences, at the very least in situations where the risk  		of harm is not imminent and the potential harm is not severe. </p>
<h2><a name="visit" id="visit">IV. SITE VISIT FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Most of the experts and stakeholders we interviewed had strong views  		about NRAs, but few had firsthand experience with an NRA or had participated in  		an NRA process. The primary purpose of our site visits was to get a sense of  		how NRAs are actually used and the views of those directly involved. To see  		firsthand how people use and think about NRAs, we visited seven facilities in  		three states--Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin--and spoke with 20 assisted living  		residents with NRAs, two family members, and 24 staff, including staff at the  		management level who had direct experience with NRAs and at least one direct  		care employee. We also reviewed the written NRAs for the residents, totaling 31  		(some residents had more than one). See <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendA">Appendix A</a> for  		detailed information about study methods and <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendD">Appendix D</a>  		for a brief description of study participants. </p>
<p>In preparation for the site visits, we talked with 26 stakeholders and  		experts in the three states, including state agency staff, consumer advocates,  		assisted living industry representatives, attorneys, insurers, and ombudsmen.  		See <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendC">Appendix C</a> for a list of those interviewed. These  		discussions provided important information about the legal, regulatory, and  		policy environments in each state. A summary of each state's regulations  		pertaining to NRAs can be found on the next page. See <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> for more detailed information about these  		regulations. </p>
<p>We next present our findings regarding how providers are using NRAs, the  		issues they address, and what residents and providers think about them. </p>
<h3>Factors Affecting the Decision to Initiate an NRA</h3>
<p>In all three states, potential and actual risks were typically  		identified by a facility employee--generally either a direct care worker or a  		nurse--and brought to the attention of a supervisor or the person responsible  		for administering risk agreements. In no case did a resident or family member  		initiate the risk agreement. NRAs were generally not initiated after a first  		report of a risky behavior, but rather after a second or third occurrence. In  		all cases, a senior staff member such as an administrator or registered nurse  		first initiated a discussion with the resident about the issue causing concern.  		If after discussing the facility's concerns, a resident voluntarily  		discontinued the risky activity, then a formal NRA process was not implemented.  		</p>
<p>Once a senior staff person determines that an NRA is necessary, the  		person responsible completes the facility's standard NRA form and presents it  		to the resident for review and discussion. An Oregon assisted living manager  		described it this way: </p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Once I or the staff identify a concern, we sit down with the  		  tenant, explain the concern, give them a chance to meet in their unit or in the  		  office, and then we discuss it and I ask them to sign itI'll say, 'I'm  		  going to be doing an [NRA] because of some reason, and we're afraid you or  		  someone else will be hurt.'" </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Oregon manager said she modifies the language of the NRA until  		the resident is satisfied with it. Similarly, an assistant manager explained  		that if the resident refuses to sign the agreement, they renegotiate to find  		out what they will agree to and that if the resident continues to refuse, he or  		she will be asked to sign a form indicating refusal to sign the NRA. </p>
<table><tr><td><font><b>Summary of Regulatory Provisions Related  			 to Risk Agreements</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b><i>Florida</i></b> licenses three  			 residential care categories under the term assisted living; the three types of  			 licenses--standard, limited nursing, and ECC--permit progressively greater  			 levels of care. The three facilities visited for this study had ECC licenses.  			 Florida's ECC regulations do not specify that a NRA process must include a  			 signed document. Rather, they define "managed risk" as a process by which  			 facility staff discuss the service plan with the resident (and, if applicable,  			 the resident's representative), to assure that consequences of a resident's  			 decisions, including any inherent risk, are explained to "all parties" and  			 reviewed periodically in conjunction with the service plan, taking into account  			 changes in the resident's status and the ability of the facility to respond  			 accordingly. The state defines "shared responsibility" as a method for  			 exploring the options available to a facility resident and the risks involved  			 with each option when making decisions pertaining to the resident's abilities,  			 preferences, and service needs, thereby enabling the resident (and, if  			 applicable, the resident's representative) and the facility to develop a  			 service plan that best meets the resident's needs and seeks to improve the  			 resident's quality of life. The Florida regulators we spoke with did  			 not interpret these provisions as allowing providers to use managed risk  			 agreements to allow resident autonomy to decline needed services or pursue  			 risky behaviors. Rather, they stated that providers are expected to find  			 creative approaches to deliver needed services and avoid risks. If an approach  			 that satisfies the resident cannot be found, and the resident continues to  			 refuse needed care or provider advice, Florida regulators expect the facility  			 to discharge the resident. </font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b><i>Oregon</i></b> defines "managed  			 risk" as a process by which the facility and a resident discuss the resident's  			 high-risk behavior or choices, alternatives to and consequences of the  			 behavior, and the resident's decision to modify the behavior or accept the  			 consequences is documented. If a managed risk plan is developed, the agreed  			 upon actions must be included in the service plan. Facilities are required to  			 identify the need for and develop a managed risk plan following the facility's  			 established guidelines and procedures. Managed risk plans must include  			 an explanation of the cause of concern, possible negative consequences to the  			 resident and/or others, a description of resident preferences, possible  			 alternatives to minimize potential risks associated with the resident's  			 preferences, a description of the services the facility will provide to  			 accommodate the resident's choice or to minimize the potential risk, and the  			 final agreement reached by all parties. Facilities may not enter into or  			 continue a risk plan with residents who are unable to recognize the  			 consequences of their behavior or choices. The managed risk plan shall be  			 reviewed at least quarterly. Residents' rights are defined to include the right  			 to be given informed choice and the opportunity to select or refuse service and  			 to accept responsibility for the consequences. The state does not  			 permit involuntary discharge from assisted living facilities; providers must  			 request state approval before asking a resident to move. Oregon considers NRAs  			 to be an important mechanism for providers to address and resolve conflicts  			 with residents regarding behaviors that place the resident or others at risk of  			 potential harm, thereby enabling residents to remain in the facility.  			 </font></td>
</tr><tr><td><font><b><i>Wisconsin</i></b> developed its  			 apartment model of assisted living--a RCAC--to provide a congregate care  			 setting that would meet residents' needs while letting them live independently  			 and respecting their autonomy. It is a model that is minimally regulated; even  			 though RCACs may provide a nursing home level of care, they are not licensed.  			 Facilities that serve Medicaid clients must be certified; all others must  			 register with the state. Whether certified or registered, both are subject to  			 the same requirements. Wisconsin requires RCACs to establish with each  			 resident a signed NRA, as a "protection for both the individual tenant and the  			 RCAC." The state requires that NRAs include a description of any situation,  			 condition, or action taken or desired to be taken by the tenant contrary to the  			 practice or advice of the facility and which could put the tenant at risk of  			 harm or injury; the tenant's preference as to how the situation is to be  			 handled and the possible consequences of acting on that preference; what the  			 facility will and will not do to meet the tenant's needs and comply with the  			 tenant's preference relative to the identified course of action; alternatives  			 offered to reduce the risk or mitigate the consequences relating to the  			 situation or condition; the agreed upon course of action, including  			 responsibilities of both the tenant and the facility; and the tenant's  			 understanding and acceptance of responsibility for the outcome from the agreed  			 upon course of action. NRAs must also include any needs identified in  			 the comprehensive assessment that the facility will not provide, either  			 directly or under contract. The regulations state that "a risk agreement may  			 not waive any provision of this chapter or any other right of the tenant," and  			 that neither the tenant nor the facility shall refuse to accept reasonable risk  			 or insist that the other party accept unreasonable risk. Risk agreements must  			 be updated when the resident's condition or service needs change in a way that  			 may affect risk or at the request of the tenant or facility. Persons  			 with dementia or other cognitive impairments that preclude individuals from  			 understanding the consequences of and accepting responsibility for their  			 choices are not permitted to move into an RCAC unless they live with a  			 significant other who is not cognitively impaired. Because the state promotes  			 "aging in place," residents who develop cognitive impairment while residing in  			 an RCAC are not required to move out, though the facility has the right to  			 discharge residents whose needs exceed their staff's capacity to provide needed  			 services. To handle situations where residents may develop cognitive  			 impairments, all residents are required to execute a durable power of attorney  			 form that can be activated if necessary. </font></td>
</tr></table><p>Managers in Florida described a similar approach focused on explaining  		the concern, suggesting alternatives, and asking the resident to accept  		responsibility for his or her choice to continue an activity that has been  		identified as risky. Staff and administrators in Florida and Oregon said NRAs  		were not often used. </p>
<p>In contrast, because Wisconsin requires all RCAC residents to have NRAs,  		they are initiated as one of many standard forms the resident is asked to  		review and sign as part of the admission process. Typically, the nurse  		conducting the preadmission assessment identifies any potential risks, which  		are then addressed in an NRA. The Director of Nursing at one of these  		facilities said she does not use the word "risk" because it frightens family  		members; instead, she makes statements such as "there is a potential that the  		resident may fall." In one facility, staff noted that about 25 percent of  		residents have no risk issues at admission, in which case they write "none" on  		the executed NRA form. </p>
<p>We heard from both stakeholders and one assisted living manager that  		many RCACs have an attorney prepare a standard NRA form. One manager said she  		would have an attorney review NRAs before they are presented to a resident,  		particularly if they were addressing a situation the facility had not  		previously addressed. </p>
<h3>NRA Processes and Formats</h3>
<p>Florida rules do not specify an NRA process, format, or required topics.  		Oregon's and Wisconsin's rules have almost identical process requirements,  		including an identification of the issue, resident preferences, possible  		consequences, alternatives to minimize risks, final agreement, and signatures  		of assisted living staff and the resident. Additionally, Wisconsin requires  		that the NRA must include any needs identified in the comprehensive assessment  		that will not be provided for by the facility, either directly or under  		contract. </p>
<p>In general, most of the forms we reviewed included the core topics  		specified in Wisconsin's and Oregon's regulations. </p>
<p>In the facilities we visited, some of the NRAs included a standard  		introductory paragraph explaining the rationale for the risk agreement (e.g.,  		the facility hopes to promote choice, but decisions residents make may put  		their health and safety at risk, or, if the resident's decision conflicts with  		facility care practices a risk agreement is warranted). One NRA stated that  		though the facility attempts to manage risk incurred by residents, the nature  		of the environment and program does not allow for the complete elimination of  		risk, and the facility will make every effort to communicate with the resident  		regarding those risks and make suggestions to remove or minimize risk. </p>
<p>One Wisconsin facility uses an NRA form with a checklist of several  		potential risks and associated responsibilities, including: (1) residents who  		are able must agree to report changes in their medical or physical status to  		facility staff or accept responsibility for negative outcomes related to the  		condition; (2) resident has a history of falls, declines one-on-one  		supervision, knows that future falls might occur, and accepts responsibility  		for injury; (3) resident has history of wandering/elopement behaviors, is  		likely to continue this, refuses one-on-one supervision, and accepts  		responsibility for risk of injury, and (4) identification of all services  		identified during a comprehensive assessment, which the resident needs, but  		that will not be provided directly or under contract by the facility. To cover  		risks not enumerated, the form has an "other" option. A staff person in this  		facility said that if a member of her family were a resident, she would like  		the NRA to be "more customized." </p>
<p>Florida does not require a written risk agreement and the agreements we  		reviewed in the three Florida facilities did not always follow the NRA  		requirements defined in Oregon and Wisconsin, including offering less risky  		alternatives and the potential for a compromise agreement. For example, one  		Florida NRA dealing with a diabetic resident's desire to eat regular desserts  		stated that eating regular desserts could lead to unstable blood sugar levels  		and that the alternative was not to eat regular desserts. The "final agreement"  		stated simply that the resident would like to continue eating regular desserts,  		rather than suggesting other options, such as eating smaller portions of  		regular desserts or having staff monitor blood sugar after consumption. </p>
<p>One Florida facility requires all residents to sign a standard managed  		risk form as an addendum to the residency agreement. This form addresses the  		risks of wandering, falls, skin breakdown, and loss of personal property. The  		form ends with the statement: I have been informed of these risks and  		understand that other risks may exist based on each individual resident's  		concerns. </p>
<p><i><b>Liability Waivers</b></i></p>
<p>In only one facility did the NRA form include liability waiver language:  		</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"I do, hereby, agree to take responsibility and assert no liability  		  against [name of facility], its employees, management firm, administrative  		  officers, staff members and practitioners practicing therein, of (sic) any  		  accident, injuries or death as a result of my refusal to comply with their  		  express and/or written provisions listed above, which I, as evidenced by this  		  document, hereby refuse to comply with." </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A senior staff member at this facility believed that a blanket waiver  		should not be signed at admission, but a limited waiver was appropriate when  		"issues arise." This facility also differed from others by using NRAs only for  		cases of noncompliance, typically related to diet and medications. While no  		other facilities we visited had NRA forms with liability waivers, one facility,  		as noted above, included standard language in its NRAs regarding the risk of  		wandering, falls, skin breakdown, and loss of personal property. Including this  		general language in an NRA appears to be an attempt to approximate a general  		liability waiver for the areas noted. </p>
<p>In Florida, although the state's regulations do not address liability  		waivers and the state exercises no oversight over NRAs, several stakeholders  		said that the state would not "approve" NRAs with liability waivers. </p>
<h3>Family and Other Third Party Involvement</h3>
<p>In all three states, the resident and the staff member responsible for  		completing NRAs meet to discuss the issue(s) and additional staff members are  		involved, depending on the topic (e.g., a nurse if the issue being discussed is  		health-related). Nearly all residents and staff we spoke with said that  		residents with full cognitive capacity have the right to exclude family members  		from the NRA process, and to tell the facility not to inform family members  		about the NRA. </p>
<p>At the same time, most staff believed that it was preferable to involve  		or at least inform family members. One manager noted that over a 9 year period,  		practically all resident placements were initiated by the family and many  		family members continue to be involved in the resident's ongoing health care  		and service decisions. A few managers and several experts noted it was  		important to involve family because, in most cases, it is the family who will  		have concerns or sue the facility if a bad outcome occurs. One staff person  		said they involve family members even if the resident doesn't want them  		involved because it "helps with resident compliance." </p>
<p>Staff noted additional individuals whom they might involve in the risk  		discussion or inform about a completed NRA, such as case managers for Medicaid  		clients (in Oregon), or the resident's physician if the NRA concerns treatment  		noncompliance such as refusal to take medications. </p>
<h3>Use of NRAs with Cognitively Impaired Residents</h3>
<p>Many staff members said they would not use NRAs with residents who do  		not understand the consequences of their actions, yet none of the facilities  		had standardized procedures to determine residents' decision-making capacity  		prior to initiating an NRA. Instead, they rely on staff's professional judgment  		and, occasionally, formal assessments to make this determination. Staff in  		Florida and Oregon stated that they know residents well enough to recognize  		whether they understand the potential outcomes of their choices. In addition,  		several Florida staff noted that the state requires an annual physician  		assessment that includes the physician's opinion of the resident's capacity,  		and that they use this information in their determination of whether a resident  		is appropriate for an NRA.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>When we asked staff how they determined a resident's capacity to make  		decisions, some staff mentioned the resident's ability to understand issues and  		risks, others mentioned a resident's ability to remember, and a few mentioned  		judgment. Several staff said that an NRA was appropriate unless informal  		assessment indicated memory or judgment impairment (e.g., observing that the  		resident often forgot their room number or what time it was). Several noted  		that memory loss is easier to identify than judgment problems, though many  		staff noted that impaired decision-making ability in one area (e.g., money  		management) does not necessarily preclude the ability to make decisions in  		other areas. </p>
<p>One noted that if she had doubts about a person's capacity to consent to  		an NRA she would administer the Mini-Mental Status Examination or a Clock  		Drawing test. Another said she uses the mini-mental test but has no hard and  		fast rules about when to use it, instead relying on judgment: "if you feel they  		understand then okay. If anyone is confused--involve family." One manager said  		it was acceptable for a family to sign an NRA, but noted that issues related to  		activating powers of attorney were unresolved. One staff person said she would  		consult with a physician if they had questions about a person's competency to  		sign an NRA. </p>
<p>While most staff believed residents needed to be able to understand the  		consequences of their decisions, some felt it was all right to use NRAs with  		residents who had memory and judgment problems. One manager said that if the  		family of a resident with memory problems said they could not pay $290 a month  		for medication administration, then she would initiate an NRA dealing with the  		risks of medication self-administration. Another said he had used an NRA with a  		resident who'd been adjudicated incompetent but had "involved the family."  		Several said they would allow a family member, power of attorney or a guardian  		to sign an NRA on a resident's behalf. Another said that decision would need to  		be made by the facility's corporate attorney. </p>
<p>Most of the facilities review NRAs either on a quarterly basis or  		following a change in resident status. Many staff were uncertain of the  		validity of an NRA if the resident experienced cognitive decline after signing  		it. One said that if a person had freely chosen to assume risk when competent,  		then the NRA should remain in force. </p>
<h3>NRA Topics</h3>
<p>Of the 31 risk agreements we reviewed, the majority dealt with behaviors  		that the facility believed posed a risk for a poor health or safety outcome for  		the resident. These include noncompliance with diabetic diets, refusing a  		prescribed pureed diet, refusing monitoring of vital signs (pulse and blood  		pressure), refusing to use a walker or wheelchair, choosing to use bedrails,  		taking unaccompanied walks, self-managing medications, refusing housekeeping,  		and assisting another resident who uses a wheelchair. </p>
<p>Three NRAs identified a specific condition as a general risk factor. One  		was for a resident who was blind and another for a resident with spinal  		stenosis. Both were perceived as being at risk for falls due to these  		conditions. The third was for a morbidly obese resident who was not able to  		wear shoes; her NRA identified risks that included falls, skin breakdown, and  		infection due to injury to the feet. The NRA included several "possible  		alternatives" for the resident to consider: (1) research weight reduction  		programs; (2) wear foot protection; (3) Xenical; (4) surgical intervention; and  		(5) possible skilled nursing facility placement. The document also listed  		several "actions" that were taken, the dates, and by whom. </p>
<p>One resident's NRA addressed a risk for falling due to general weakness  		after surgery; in her NRA, she agreed to use a wheelchair if she had to go a  		long distance. One facility in Wisconsin conducted a fall risk assessment for  		every prospective resident and those at high risk were required to sign an NRA  		addressing falls at admission. </p>
<p>In Oregon, several managed risk plans involved smoking in prohibited  		areas--a behavior that presented a risk to both self and others. Most others  		involved behaviors that did not pose risks but were offensive to others, such  		as being drunk, playing loud music, yelling at staff and other residents, and  		watching pornography while staff cleaned the apartment. </p>
<p>While many of the topics listed above fit within the NRA conceptual  		framework (i.e., a resident's behavior or choice poses potential risks to  		health or safety and the facility and resident work out an agreement that will  		protect the resident's autonomy), several do not. The major risk identified in  		several of the managed risk plans in Oregon was the risk of eviction if the  		resident did not comply with facility rules. These risk agreements were more  		like behavior modification plans, since the agreement was basically "comply or  		goodbye." </p>
<p>Because Oregon does not allow involuntary discharge from assisted living  		facilities without state review, it appears that some Oregon providers are  		using managed risk forms to document problem behaviors and providers' attempts  		to correct them should an eviction become necessary. Interviews with experts in  		that state indicated that the managed risk agreement is used in this way,  		though not all agree that this is an appropriate use. In such cases, the "risk"  		is that the resident will be asked to move out rather than the more commonly  		understood risk to health or safety. Additionally, a primary purpose of these  		NRAs is to try and secure the residents' compliance with rules not to increase  		options for residents' autonomy. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin, in addition to specifying what actions the facility would  		take to reduce risk, some NRAs specified what the facility would not do to  		address the risk. For example, in the case of noncompliance with a diabetic  		diet, the NRA stated that the facility can not supervise dietary intake on a  		24-hour basis, prevent purchases at the facility gift store, and remove candy  		from the resident's apartment. In another NRA addressing the facility's concern  		about a resident who took long unsupervised walks, the NRA specified that the  		facility will encourage the resident to ask another resident to walk with her;  		that she will sign out when she leaves the building; that she will not walk  		beyond where she can see the building; and that 24-hour monitoring of  		whereabouts and an escort for outdoor walks are not available services. </p>
<p>Overall, in Oregon, the agreements dealt more with problem behaviors  		than risky behaviors. In Florida, they were primarily used for dietary  		noncompliance, and in Wisconsin they were used both for general conditions that  		were perceived as risks--for example, blindness--as well as specific risks,  		such as the use of bed rails against the facility's advice. </p>
<h3>Resident, Family, and Staff Views about NRAs</h3>
<p>In addition to reviewing NRAs, we also asked residents, family members,  		and staff how they felt about NRAs, as well as their views on their purpose and  		specific issues such as whether persons with cognitive impairment should have  		NRAs. </p>
<p><i><b>Awareness of NRAs</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>Staff</i></b>. A clear distinction emerged between management  		staff and direct care staff when asked about residents' NRAs. Management staff  		were almost always aware of residents' NRAs and their content. On the other  		hand their understanding of the general principles of NRAs as established in  		the assisted living literature or in corporate policies varied widely. Where  		the principles were understood, some facility staff disagreed with the risk  		taking allowed under corporate policies. </p>
<p>In Oregon, direct care staff were aware of NRAs; in Florida and  		Wisconsin most were not aware that a resident had an NRA and in some cases, did  		not know what an NRA was. Some direct care staff had been briefed by management  		about issues addressed in residents' NRAs as well as the agreement reached, but  		they were unfamiliar with the NRA concept or process. Those who were not aware  		of the NRA stated that it was their responsibility to continually encourage  		residents to do what was best for the resident and report concerns to  		management. </p>
<p>The lack of direct care staff's awareness of NRAs appeared to be a  		system failure in most facilities and deliberate in some. One manager explained  		that she did not want direct care staff making decisions about how to implement  		the NRA. Rather, she wanted the direct care staff to alert her to all risky  		behavior and leave it to her to resolve. Direct care workers in this facility  		did understand that their responsibilities included informing the manager  		and/or a nurse about problem or risky behaviors, such as refusing medication,  		dietary noncompliance, or smoking. Overall, Florida direct care staff had the  		least knowledge of NRAs. </p>
<p><b><i>Residents</i></b>. All of the Oregon residents knew they had a  		risk agreement, remembered signing it, and were able to explain its content and  		purpose. The residents in Florida and Wisconsin were aware of the issues in  		their NRAs, but many did not recall discussing them or having signed an  		agreement. Most Florida residents interviewed had a difficult time  		understanding the concept of risk assumption and the purpose of an NRA. Many  		noted that they should be able to do what they wanted but also believed the  		facility should not allow residents (other than themselves) to assume risks.  		Because Wisconsin requires that all RCAC residents have an NRA at the time of  		admission, for many residents, it was just one of many forms they signed when  		moving in. However, while most of the Wisconsin residents knew the general  		issues addressed in their NRAs, some could not articulate the specifics of the  		agreements. </p>
<p><i><b>Purpose of NRAs</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>Staff</i></b>. Most managers and a few direct care staff saw NRAs  		as having two primary and related purposes: (1) to allow residents independence  		while affording the facilities some protection against liability for negative  		outcomes related to the NRA topic, and (2) to foster communication with  		residents and their families about important health and safety issues by  		providing a formal mechanism for doing so. As noted above, many direct care  		staff did not know what an NRA was or its purpose, and one manager said,  		"People are not clear about the purpose." </p>
<p>In general, the Florida management and other staff seemed somewhat  		uncertain about the purpose of NRAs and how to use them; in contrast, their  		corporate staff were well versed in the concept. This may, in part, reflect the  		uncertain regulatory treatment of NRAs in Florida. In one setting, a  		representative from the corporate office clearly understood and advocated the  		use of risk agreements. In another, the manager felt that they were designed by  		the administrators/ owners simply to document discussions about risky behaviors  		and the facility's attempt to address them. One staff person said she did not  		support their use but used them because they were required by corporate policy.  		</p>
<p>A direct care employee said that having an NRA was much better than just  		having a discussion because it made more of an impression on the resident and  		family and documented the discussion. In Wisconsin, two managers noted that if  		their own parents were in RCACs they should be able to make their own decisions  		and choices and that NRAs would make it easier for them to do so. They also  		felt that they were useful to staff because they provided a mechanism for  		recognizing potential risks and challenges in providing care for a given  		resident and for focusing on prevention by educating residents and families  		about the risks of certain behaviors. They also discussed their importance as a  		tool to make residents and families deal with important issues. </p>
<p>For example, in one facility, a resident needing transfer assistance  		often did not call for assistance and had fallen several times. The NRA was  		used to make the family aware that staff was available to assist their parent,  		but the parent needed to request assistance. In another case, a son wanted the  		facility to prevent his diabetic mother from buying and eating candy, and the  		NRA specified that the facility could not exercise that level of control over  		his mother. </p>
<p>Managers were divided in their views about whether a formal NRA provided  		protection against lawsuits or decreased liability in the event of a lawsuit.  		One manager said that the NRA is not a contract that relieves the provider of  		responsibility, but it is a document that "lets everyone know about the  		situation." However, many assisted living staff spoke about providers' need and  		right to be protected from liability if residents choose not to follow staff's  		advice and are injured as a result. </p>
<p>Many managers believe that NRAs are needed to allow residents autonomy  		in a residential care setting that is intentionally different from more heavily  		regulated nursing facilities. Specifically, while many recognized that assisted  		living is a licensed setting that is expected to protect the well being of  		residents, it is also a consumer-driven model of service delivery that needs to  		balance this protection with residents' rights to make decisions even when they  		entail risk. Some staff expressed frustration, saying that regardless of what  		is documented in the NRA and their best efforts to take care of residents, they  		will be held responsible for any negative outcomes. </p>
<p>Some felt that NRAs would not hold up in court, but others felt that in  		the event of a lawsuit, a formal NRA documenting both the resident's choice to  		incur risk as well as the facility's efforts to educate the resident about the  		risks and to offer alternatives to the risk behavior could be helpful. None of  		the staff we spoke with had heard of or experienced a lawsuit involving an NRA.  		</p>
<p><b><i>Residents</i></b>. For residents with NRAs, their views regarding  		the purpose of NRAs were personalized to their own particular circumstances,  		although some made contradictory statements and others did not appear to  		understand their purpose. For example: </p>
<ul><li>"It says you need to be careful and ask for help when you need it. I  		  think it needs to be written because that's the rule."</li>
<li>"I don't mind people talking to me about risk. I'd prefer to do  		  things and decide things myself. If someone says something is risky, I'll  		  listen but I prefer to make decisions myself. If they told me to wait for  		  assistance because doing something was risky, I would wait even if they were  		  late to assist me."</li>
<li>"I don't know if I have an NRA--I'm sure my daughter did it for me. I  		  would always follow advice about what to do and not to do; therefore, there is  		  no need for me to have an NRA. <i>Are you comfortable with the idea of having  		  to sign an NRA to do what you want?</i> Yes. I'm responsible for my own  		  actions."</li>
<li>"Negotiation is the only way--you need to have a solution that  		  everyone is comfortable with. If a facility is clearly uncomfortable--then they  		  need to express this and help you understand it. It's necessary--it levels the  		  playing field--it forces a discussion." [Son of a resident.] </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Attitudes about NRAs</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>Staff</i></b>. Assisted living staff expressed both positive and  		negative attitudes about NRAs. Reflecting the use of managed risk agreements as  		behavior modification agreements by the Oregon facilities, some Oregon staff  		noted that the risk agreement itself might not lead to a change in residents'  		behavior. Others worried that residents required to enter into a NRA to  		exercise their choice felt "picked on" and that initiating them upsets the  		resident or makes them think they have done something "wrong." Still others  		felt they helped residents make choices important to them. </p>
<p>Staff in Oregon and Wisconsin said that NRAs made them feel more  		comfortable when addressing difficult situations because they provide a formal,  		written process for uncomfortable discussions. Some said that being able to  		"blame" the requirement for an NRA on state regulations or corporate  		requirements made it easier to use them to raise and address risky or problem  		behaviors. </p>
<p>In all three states, at least some staff stated that they or "others"  		are not certain about how to use NRAs, which makes them feel uncomfortable. A  		manager in Wisconsin noted that she only used them "because the state makes us"  		and did not think they really helped because the facility would not admit  		residents who posed major risks. A nurse in another state noted that her  		facility screens at admission and does not admit people with problems that  		might require an NRA, particularly people who are noncompliant. </p>
<p>Several managers and nurses said NRAs make them more comfortable with  		allowing residents to make choices that pose risks. One nurse said that NRAs  		"put everything out on the table" for the resident, staff, and family to  		discuss together; she noted that the nursing home where she used to work made  		family members sign "waivers of responsibility" if they refused to allow the  		staff to apply physical restraints. </p>
<p>Some administrators indicated that they would not use NRAs at all if it  		were up to them but that their corporate offices required them as a risk  		management tool. They said that they were not comfortable allowing residents to  		do things that could lead them to "get hurt." One nurse noted that if she felt  		a resident was really at risk of harm she would not keep them in the facility  		because "I feel responsible for anyone who lives here--if they don't have the  		judgment and the family doesn't exercise good judgment, then I can't keep them  		here." Similarly, another nurse said she was satisfied with the NRA process,  		but if a noncompliant diabetic was experiencing very high blood sugars on a  		daily basis, "we would tell the family she needs to go to a nursing home." </p>
<p>An administrator said she was reluctant to use NRAs because the concept  		of allowing residents to do things that could hurt them conflicted with her  		sense of professional responsibility and personal ethics, both of which  		required the protection of residents. In another facility, a manager strongly  		supported resident autonomy and the use of NRAs to assure it. Reflecting these  		differing views, one manager said that the degree of risk that the facility was  		willing to tolerate was based in large part on individual nurses' views about  		promoting autonomy and assuring protection. </p>
<p>Several staff said that additional guidance about NRAs would be useful  		because some people don't know how to use them; one noted "it would be nice to  		have information about options that you would not otherwise think about." </p>
<p><b><i>Residents</i></b>. In general, residents spoke clearly about their  		desire to make choices and indicated that neither families nor facilities  		should tell them what to do when their choice did not endanger others. The most  		positive statements included opinions that the approach is fair, that it  		reminds residents that they have both rights and responsibilities, and that it  		demonstrates that employees are looking out for their well being. However, when  		presented with hypothetical situations, residents who believed that they  		personally should have full capacity to accept risk were less sure that other  		residents should be allowed to make risky decisions. Several said that other  		residents should do what their nurses or doctors tell them to if it is for  		their own health and safety. </p>
<p>Residents in Oregon had more negative views, with some feeling  		threatened by the process. A few indicated that if they did not sign the  		agreement they would lose a privilege or be evicted. Others felt it was unfair  		and that it would be better to just talk about an issue rather than have to  		sign an agreement. One noted it was fair but felt the facility's rules were too  		strict. In the one instance where the NRA dealt with a health risk--when the  		resident refused to eat a pureed diet--the resident stated that initially she  		did not understand why she had to sign an NRA and was a little annoyed, but now  		feels that she did the right thing. </p>
<p>The following comments illustrate the range of residents' attitudes in  		all three states:</p>
<ul><li>"I signed the NRA for the sake of the staff. It's OK to sign it, but  		  you shouldn't have to leave if you refuse to sign it."</li>
<li>"They told me about the dangers involved and I want to take the  		  risk."</li>
<li>"I can't think of any other way than using an NRA. There's nothing  		  wrong with it. I'm not intimidated by it--but others might be, depending on  		  their personality and age."</li>
<li>"The purpose is to keep them [the facility] from being liable. I  		  shouldn't have had to sign the NRA to stay here--it should be my decision to  		  eat what I want."</li>
<li>"I didn't mind signing it. The administrator explained that it was  		  for me to accept responsibility in case of harm, but it doesn't make any  		  difference in making choices."</li>
<li>"The administrator explained the negative outcomes of a nondiabetic  		  diet, talked to me as an adult, left the decision to me."</li>
<li>"I'm old enough to know what I should and shouldn't eat. It's  		  reasonable for the facility to have some liability protection; I wouldn't sue  		  anyway."</li>
<li>"I don't remember signing it but I would because I want to live here.  		  It's my decision, not my family's. If I eat what I want, it's my fault, not the  		  facilities."</li>
<li>"Once in a while if you want something sweet you should be able to  		  make that choice. In general, though people shouldn't be able to take on too  		  much risk."</li>
<li>"I want my bedrails because they help me to help myself. I couldn't  		  see the reason why I shouldn't have them. My daughter agreed. It's OK to sign  		  an NRA for this." </li>
</ul><p>Of the two family members interviewed, one was very positive about using  		NRAs to allow his mother who had cognitive impairment the freedom to take walks  		outside the facility because he did not want her to feel confined. At the same  		time he recognized the facility's concern about their liability if she were  		harmed while walking. The other family member expressed concern about whether  		or not her mother actually understood the risks that were discussed. She  		questioned the NRA's effectiveness when her mother didn't remember the  		discussion or signing the document. She noted, "Just because she signs doesn't  		mean she understands." </p>
<h3>Summary of Key Site Visit Findings</h3>
<p>Our NRA study surveyed seven facilities in three states. It is important  		to remember that this is a very limited and nonrepresentative sample of  		providers, staff, and residents. Our findings, therefore, are not  		generalizable. Instead, they suggest areas for further research or  		confirmation. With this caveat in mind, our major findings are:</p>
<ul><li>With the exception of Wisconsin, which mandates NRAs for all RCAC  		  residents at the time of admission, NRAs appear to be used infrequently and  		  selectively, generally only when informal discussions have not resolved an  		  issue that has arisen more than once.</li>
<li>NRAs are generally viewed as a complement to service planning to  		  address specific issues.</li>
<li>Several residents did not remember signing the agreement or the  		  specific details of their agreements. However, all residents believed strongly  		  that they should be able to make lifestyle and personal decisions that may  		  place them at risk and many indicated that neither families nor facilities  		  should tell them what to do when their choice did not endanger others. Some  		  residents were comfortable with the use of NRAs but others said they should not  		  have to sign them as a condition of exercising a choice.</li>
<li>Staff view NRAs primarily as a complement to service planning and a  		  useful method for formally discussing issues, resolving disagreements, and  		  addressing residents' behaviors or choices that providers believe pose risks to  		  their health and safety. All staff agreed that behaviors that place staff or  		  other residents at risk are not appropriate for negotiation.</li>
<li>A significant benefit of NRAs noted by staff is to require discussion  		  about difficult issues that providers, residents, and families might otherwise  		  avoid. In fact, the process' utility appears to have led to its use in areas  		  involving difficult discussions that do not involve risk.</li>
<li>While some staff believe that NRAs could provide some liability  		  protection in the event of a lawsuit over a negative outcome, they do not view  		  this potential protection as the sole or primary purpose of the NRA. All  		  management and professional staff agreed that an explicit discussion with  		  residents and families about risk and of measures that can be taken to reduce  		  risk can reduce providers' liability exposure.</li>
<li>All staff agreed that behaviors that place staff or other residents  		  at risk are not appropriate for negotiation.</li>
<li>Staff had mixed feelings about NRAs, sometimes expressing frustration  		  with the desire for residents to be autonomous. This frustration appeared to  		  stem from two concerns: (1) fear that residents might get hurt while they have  		  a moral obligation to protect them, and (2) concern that they are held  		  responsible for all negative outcomes.</li>
<li>Often, direct care staff did not have much familiarity with the  		  concept of NRAs, know that an individual resident had an NRA, or, if they knew  		  a resident had an NRA, they did not know what impact it had on service delivery  		  or a resident's ability to assume risk. This lack of knowledge, in some cases,  		  negated the effectiveness of an NRA as a tool to empower resident  		  decision-making.</li>
<li>None of the NRAs we reviewed supported the view that providers are  		  using NRAs exclusively as a liability "dodge" to allow them to admit and keep  		  residents beyond the facility's capacity to care for them--or for poor quality  		  care. However, some standardized NRAs were overly broad and inappropriate for  		  persons with cognitive impairment (e.g., one facility had a standard NRA form  		  that included a statement that a resident accepts responsibility for risk of  		  injury due to wandering).</li>
<li>In most cases, providers are not using standardized assessment  		  methods to assess decision-making capacity. Most staff appeared unaware of the  		  legal standards for determining capacity to consent--which is analogous to  		  decision-making capacity--and appeared to lack knowledge about the cognitive  		  domains and other factors that affect this capacity. Most staff said they  		  determined decision-making capacity primarily on the basis of informal  		  observation of a resident's memory even though memory is not a cognitive  		  component of the capacity to consent.</li>
<li>Some facilities are allowing surrogates to sign NRAs without  		  knowledge of their legal standing to accept risk on behalf of the  		  resident.</li>
<li>Some facilities are using NRAs for issues or purposes that are not  		  within the boundaries of NRAs as originally conceived by early advocates. This  		  includes using NRAs to document one-sided, nonnegotiable discussions involving  		  a behavior that the facility requires the resident to stop, using NRAs to  		  identify a resident's general condition that may increase risks (e.g.,  		  blindness), and using NRAs as a general waiver of liability (e.g., loss of  		  personal property) or to control behaviors that may be offensive to staff or  		  other residents. </li>
</ul><h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">V. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Assisted living providers, policy makers, aging advocates, and LTC  		experts have defined NRAs as a mechanism to enhance resident choice by  		providing a rigorous process designed to balance autonomy and risk for  		residents and providers in assisted living. </p>
<p>While our sample is small and not representative, our findings suggest  		that NRAs can be a useful tool to help residents and providers achieve a  		balance between desires for autonomy and concerns about safety. At the same  		time, they suggest that the NRA concept is proving difficult to broadly and  		consistently operationalize.</p>
<ul><li>NRA processes and purposes are not well understood and appear to vary  		  widely across states, providers, and even staff in the same facility. While  		  this may not be surprising given that assisted living varies widely within and  		  across states, it does raise significant concerns about standards for the  		  process. As identified in this study, the appropriate use of NRAs requires at a  		  minimum, guidance in their use, as well as education and training.</li>
<li>NRAs are not being used uniformly to maximize resident autonomy by  		  balancing specific risks and consumer preferences as supporters advocate. Few  		  of the NRAs we reviewed adhered to a form, process, or guidelines appropriate  		  for the practice concept or to the recommendations in the Assisted Living  		  Federation of America's report on NRAs.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note45">45</a></font></sup> While some NRAs fit advocates' concepts,  		  others that we reviewed addressed appropriate issues but did not include a  		  discussion of alternatives or a negotiation, presenting topics in an either/or  		  framework. Some NRAs simply identified the risk, stated that the resident  		  should not do what they identified as risky, and then noted that the resident  		  planned to continue and accepted the risk.</li>
<li>Some NRAs were used for issues other than specific risks. These NRAs  		  were used to control behaviors that were outside of community norms or to note  		  a general risk factor like blindness or obesity, which the provider wanted to  		  highlight. Some were used as behavior modification agreements, stating that  		  unless a resident ceased a particular behavior, like smoking or disturbing the  		  peace, they would be discharged from the facility. However, in no case, with  		  the information available to us, did we determine that NRAs were being used to  		  pressure residents into accepting inadequate care, the primary concern of NRA  		  opponents. </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Liability Waivers</b></i></p>
<p>The inclusion of liability waivers in NRAs is the most contentious issue  		in the NRA debate. Some argue they are essential, some that they will be  		exploited, and others that they are unenforceable. However, it appears that  		NRAs can be structured to address provider and consumer concerns without using  		formal or even implicit liability waivers. Most experts agreed that the  		availability of a signed document recording formal discussions between the  		facility and resident regarding risky choices, staff attempts to reduce risk,  		and the residents' acknowledgment of their choice despite the risks, is  		comparable in protection to a formal waiver of liability in the event of a law  		suit. </p>
<p>The enforceability of liability waivers has not been tested in the  		courts but most experts do not believe that NRAs with such waivers provide any  		more liability protection than those without them. While one legal expert  		asserts that an NRA could have an enforceable liability waiver, none of the  		NRAs we reviewed appeared to follow the process this expert outlined to assure  		their enforceability.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note46">46</a></font></sup>  		Other legal experts suggested that NRAs may not need a liability waiver to  		accomplish the protection sought.<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#note47">47</a></font></sup></p>
<p>NRA proponents who believe liability waivers are essential should be  		equally concerned about the use of NRAs with residents who lack decision-making  		capacity, because in the event of a lawsuit, NRAs with or without waivers are  		likely to be voided by the courts if the facility cannot prove that it  		accurately determined a resident's decision-making capacity. </p>
<p><i><b>Use of NRAs with Cognitively Impaired Residents </b></i></p>
<p>Whether NRAs should be used or continued with residents who have  		cognitive impairment is unclear. If an individual includes the authority to  		enter into an NRA in a power of attorney, and if a court has granted a guardian  		this power, legal concerns about the use of surrogates are lessened. In most  		states, guidelines regarding NRAs and surrogates are either completely lacking  		or do not adequately address this issue. </p>
<p>Additional state guidance regarding appropriate and inappropriate use of  		surrogates would be helpful to providers and would afford protection to persons  		with cognitive impairment. A long history of what some call protective  		paternalism towards persons with mental retardation (MR) led to a movement to  		support self-determination--even if it entails risk. States may find useful  		information in the MR literature to inform the development of guidance  		regarding the use of NRAs or similar tools with older persons with impaired  		decision-making capacity. </p>
<p><i><b>Alternatives to NRAs</b></i></p>
<p>It may be possible to address certain risk topics found in our review of  		NRAs using a process that is more closely tied to service planning,  		particularly to address areas of risk that are typically dealt with in service  		plans, such as prescribed diets, medications, and use of bedrails. For example,  		to obtain the primary advantages of fostering communication and documenting  		discussions and choices, providers could use forms that address "specialized  		service planning issues" as well as forms that are treated as addendums to the  		service plan. </p>
<p>This approach would have the advantage of being part of initial and  		ongoing service planning while avoiding the legal complexities of an NRA.  		However, an enhanced serving planning approach would not afford the benefits of  		negotiation and risk assumption that many proponents believe are their main  		value--both to enhance resident autonomy and protect providers from liability  		for the consequences of residents' choices. Some stakeholders believe that many  		issues related to lifestyle choices, such as having pets and smoking, can be or  		should be dealt with in residency/tenant agreements. </p>
<p>In sum, stakeholders and experts disagree about the advantages and  		disadvantages of NRAs. The meaning of "risk" and views regarding the relative  		importance of protection and autonomy varies among the many disciplines  		involved in assisted living practice--providers, consumer advocates,  		regulators, nurses, social workers, attorneys, and insurers. Even among  		advocates, especially between traditional advocates for the elderly and  		advocates for persons with disabilities, views on the need for NRAs and  		implementation standards vary widely. </p>
<p>While many advocates and opponents characterize the debate as absolute  		for or against NRAs, the debate is better characterized as an attempt to  		determine acceptable limits to choice and what process best achieves a balance  		between autonomy and safety. It seems likely that with increasing attention to  		the rights of persons with disabilities to exercise choice and assume risk in  		both LTC settings and independent housing, strategies for enhancing older  		persons' autonomy will become increasingly important. </p>
<p>NRAs or similar processes show some promise in providing a practical  		approach to enhancing resident autonomy in a living environment where a  		regulatory emphasis on safety and concerns about liability are salient factors  		affecting provider behavior. However, if NRAs are the correct tool for striking  		a reasonable balance between safety and autonomy, states, consumer advocates,  		provider associations, and the legal community need to give more detailed  		attention to how their use should be operationalized so they can play a  		significant role and to prevent potential abuse. Stakeholders also need to  		examine what role NRAs can or should play in providing a process for  		"reasonable accommodation" when state or provider proscribed admission and  		discharge limits conflict with residents' preferences. </p>

<p><a name="note30" id="note30"><i>Newsweek</i></a> recently ran a cover article  			 titled <i>Lawsuit Hell: How Fear of Litigation is Paralyzing Our  			 Professions</i> (12/15/03). The article chronicles the extraordinary practices  			 that some medical and other professionals are adopting to lower the risk of  			 liability in the face of a "litigation explosion," perceived or real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note31" id="note31">"It</a> may be a mistake to assume that the  			 facility can absolve itself of responsibility for the resident by negotiating  			 and having the resident execute a waiver, release of liability, or other form  			 of "negotiated risk agreement." No matter what an assisted living provider  			 recites in the contract, it may be liable if avoidable harm to a resident in  			 its facility is foreseeable and the provider stands by and makes no reasonable  			 effort to intervene. Any written contract that purports to exonerate a facility  			 from such a fundamental civil duty is likely to be deemed by the courts to be  			 unconscionable and against public policy, particularly when a waiver or release  			 pertains to future unknown events. Moreover, an elderly person signing such an  			 agreement probably will be considered disadvantaged and unable to engage in an  			 enforceable, arm's-length transaction." (Gordon (1999) cited in Carlson, E.  			 (2003) <i>op. cit</i>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note32" id="note32">Burgess,</a> K. (2000) cited in Lynch, A.A.,  			 Teachworth, S.A. (2002) <i>op. cit</i>. Lynch and Teachworth argue that NRAs  			 can meet the basic premises of contract law, and if these are met in a specific  			 NRA it will increase the likelihood of its enforceability. They construct this  			 argument based on case law they believe to be relevant to determining how  			 courts will view liability waivers in negotiated risk agreements. Carlson, E.  			 (2003), based on the case law he believes is relevant, firmly states that  			 standards of care, unequal bargaining positions between providers and  			 consumers, and regulatory mandates, make risk agreements unenforceable under  			 existing law. </p>
<p>Carlson criticizes Lynch and Teachworth's review of the  			 enforceability of liability waivers in negotiated risk agreements, stating that  			 in an effort to build support, they rely exclusively on sports-related cases.  			 These cases, Carlson argues, are not applicable to the circumstances in a  			 long-term care setting. "Liability waivers are almost always invalid in a  			 consumer context," according to Carlson, except in sports-related cases,  			 "especially extreme sports like skydiving." </p>
<p>However, the case law Carlson cites appears to lack direct  			 applicability to the issues at hand as well, focusing on situations where a  			 liability waiver is found invalid because existing state law already protects a  			 provider: </p>
<p>"However, defendant need not rely on a covenant not to sue to  			 protect itself from liability for inherent risks and unforeseen consequences.  			 Under traditional tort law principles, medical care providers are not liable  			 for such inherent risks and unforeseen consequences (Cudnik v. William Beaumont  			 Hospital, 525 N.W.2d 891, 896 (Mich. Ct. App. 1994) cited in Carlson, E.  			 (2002)) or where obvious negligence is involved--failure to change light bulbs  			 and repair broken stairs--and a waiver is unenforceable as a result." </p>
<p>None of Carlson's examples speak to the specific situation that  			 proponents of NRAs describe--a situation where liability waivers are introduced  			 as a defense when a bad outcome has occurred, without provider negligence,  			 after a competent resident in a regulated setting chose to opt out of  			 established practice or regulatory standards in order to pursue a preferred but  			 riskier course. Experts agree that this "perfect" case does not currently exist  			 and that, until it does, firm conclusions regarding the enforceability of NRAs  			 are more about convictions and individual bias than parallel "fact  			 patterns."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note33" id="note33">One</a> attorney suggested the lack of litigation  			 involving NRAs might indicate that they work (i.e., they prevent lawsuits  			 through better communication with residents and families about difficult  			 issues, which is preferable to depending on an NRA as a defense in a negligence  			 case).</p>

<p><a name="note37" id="note37">Some</a> experts noted that NRAs might become an  			 important tool in implementing rights guaranteed through disability rights law.  			 These experts commented that the trend in case law is to use the ADA, the FHA,  			 and the FHAA, to strike down overly broad regulatory limits to occupancy in  			 community care settings, and require reasonable accommodation of residents'  			 preferences when limits are based on state or provider-determined disability  			 categories. Courts are beginning to focus on the specific capacity of the  			 resident, his or her stated preference and risk tolerance, and the provider's  			 or a third party's ability to meet the resident's needs. </p>
<p>Some of these experts believe that as case law continues to define  			 consumers' rights to assume risk, risk agreements are a potentially strong tool  			 with which to implement consumer choice in congregate settings accustomed to a  			 prescriptive regulatory and program culture. These experts also expressed the  			 need for a formal process, perhaps an NRA, to document consumer preferences and  			 provider responsibilities as consumer preference begins to take precedence over  			 strict regulatory structures designed to assure safety and adequate  			 care.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A: METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>To conduct this study, we used standard qualitative analysis techniques,  		including a review of the published and unpublished literature; a review of  		statutes, regulations, and case law; discussions with experts and key  		stakeholders in long-term care law, policy and practice; and in-depth  		interviews with the staff and residents of assisted living facilities in three  		states. We describe each of these methods in detail below.</p>
<h3>Literature Review</h3>
<p>We searched five primary databases to identify literature addressing  		NRAs or similar concepts.</p>
<ul><li>Academic Search Premier: An online searchable database, including the  		  following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Social Sciences Abstracts.</li>
<li>AgeLine: A searchable electronic database sponsored by AARP,  		  containing detailed summaries of publications about older adults and aging,  		  including books, journal and magazine articles, research reports, and  		  videos.</li>
<li>Google: An Internet search engine with access to over three billion  		  web pages.</li>
<li>ResearchPort: An on-line searchable database, including Academic  		  Search Premier, ArticleFirst, Catalog USMai, MasterFile Premier, and  		  Worldcat.</li>
<li>LexisNexis Academic: An online research database that accesses over  		  5,600 news, business, legal, medical, and reference publications.</li>
</ul><p>We used the following search terms: risk agreement, managed risk,  		negotiated risk, shared responsibility, assisted living, residential care,  		senior housing, and board and care. We also used a combination of individual  		terms and Boolean structures (e.g., risk agreement AND assisted living). We  		conducted the literature review in January and February 2004. Most of the  		published literature on NRAs is not in peer reviewed journals or law reviews.  		The majority is in newsletters from legal, provider, and advocacy associations,  		other trade publications, and papers prepared by legal advocacy groups. We used  		our contacts with the assisted living trade associations and consumer groups to  		identify this literature. Several of the experts with whom we consulted also  		sent us unpublished analyses. No studies have been published to date on the  		content and outcomes of NRAs. </p>
<h3>Review of Statutes and Regulations</h3>
<p>We conducted the regulatory review in January and February 2004. We used  		three primary sources to identify state statutes and regulations governing  		NRAs. </p>
<ul><li>Westlaw: An online legal research service that accesses over 17,000  		  databases. Permits searches of stated administrative codes, case law, and  		  statutes.</li>
<li>LexisNexis Academic: Codes &amp; Regulations by state: includes  		  statutory laws, court rules from all states and attorneys general opinions from  		  all states.</li>
<li>National Academy of State Health Policy: Website [<a href="http://www.nashp.org">http://www.nashp.org</a>] was used to access state  		  rules on assisted living. States with digital (i.e., WORD, PDF or HTML) files  		  accessible via a web site were reviewed using the search above terms.</li>
</ul><p>The primary search terms we used include: risk agreement, managed risk,  		negotiated risk, and shared responsibility. Additionally, we searched each  		states full regulation and/or statute database for the phrase risk  		AND assisted living (we substituted appropriate terms for assisted  		living, such as board and care and residential care facility, in states that  		used different terms. This broader search yielded many general mentions of  		risk, such as health or safety risks, but also lead us to the Arkansas codes  		that use the term compliance agreement. </p>
<p>Because our search strategy may have overlooked statutes or regulations  		that use terms other than those we used, we checked the list of states we  		identified with NRAs (or similar concepts) in regulations or statute against  		lists developed by other experts, including Robert Mollica, Eric Carlson, Allan  		Lynch and Sara Teachworth, and Keren Brown Wilson. When our list varied from  		that of the other experts, we revisited the state regulations and statutes and  		adjusted our list as necessary.</p>
<h3>Consultation and Interviews with Experts and  		Stakeholders</h3>
<p>We identified experts in long-term care policy, practice and law,  		assisted living, and NRAs in consultation with the project officer based on the  		authors knowledge and expertise and the literature review. We added other  		experts using a snowball method based on suggestions made by the  		first set of experts. We discussed NRAs with a total of 27 people using a  		structured discussion guide. In most cases the discussions took place via  		telephone. A few individuals preferred to write their responses to the  		questions. See <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendC">Appendix C</a> for a list of the experts and  		stakeholders with whom we consulted. </p>
<h3>Site Visits</h3>
<p>We conducted site visits to assisted living facilities in three states  		to obtain information about how NRAs are used in practice. </p>
<p><b><i>State Selection</i></b></p>
<p>Based on expert interviews and a review of state regulations and  		statutes governing assisted living facilities, we identified 15 states that  		reference some type of risk agreement process in their statutes and/or  		regulations. The states vary in the scope, content, and definition of  		negotiated risk. The budget allowed for three site visits and we used the  		following primary site selection criteria: </p>
<ul><li>a state that requires a risk agreement between provider and resident,  		  </li>
<li>a state that provides a detailed process, and </li>
<li>a state that defines NRAS generally as a process. </li>
</ul><p>An additional criterion included the maturity of the states  		assisted living experience as represented by the year that the governing rules  		were adopted. Based on the criteria, we selected three states. </p>
<ul><li><b>Florida</b> uses a general, process-based definition of managed  		  risk and the states rules have been in effect since 1991. The state has  		  also experienced a high rate of provider liability suits in long-term care,  		  which we thought might make providers more likely to use NRAs.</li>
<li><b>Oregon</b> first defined assisted living in 1990 and originated  		  the concept of NRAs in assisted living. The rules define the process for risk  		  agreements in detail, but do not require them.</li>
<li><b>Wisconsin</b> has required one specific type of residential care  		  setting--an unlicensed apartment model--to use NRAs. The state created this  		  setting--called Residential Care Apartment Complexes (RCACs)--in 1997.  		  Wisconsins rules are among the most detailed in scope and content. The  		  rules restrict the use of risk agreements to waiver other regulations for this  		  setting.</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Institutional Review Board Approval</i></b></p>
<p>The study team had existing relationships with assisted living  		providers, stakeholders, and/or regulators in all three of these states and we  		contacted them for assistance in identifying and recruiting facilities to  		participate in the study. We selected three facilities in Florida, three in  		Oregon, and two in Wisconsin. In Wisconsin and Oregon, we visited one for  		profit and one non-profit facility; in Florida we visited one non-profit and  		two for profits.</p>
<p>Once we identified facilities that were willing to participate, we  		prepared informed consent forms, discussion guides, and permission forms to  		review resident records in accordance with requirements of the Health Insurance  		Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We customized consent forms for  		professional and management staff, direct care staff, and residents. We  		submitted all forms to RTIs Institutional Review Board for review and  		approval before asking providers to recruit residents to participate in the  		study.</p>
<p><b><i>Discussions with Staff and Residents</i></b></p>
<p>We asked assisted living managers in Florida and Oregon to identify  		residents with active NRAs who were willing to speak with us. Because everyone  		in Wisconsin in RCACs has an NRA, we asked the manager to identify residents  		with a range of risk topics. At each facility we talked to at least two  		management-level employees who had direct experience with NRAs and at least one  		direct care employee; we interviewed a total of 22 residents and 24 staff. See  		<a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendD">Appendix D</a> for a summary description of study  		participants.</p>
<h2><a name="appendB" id="appendB">APPENDIX B: STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING NEGOTIATED  		RISK AGREEMENTS</a></h2>
<p>Our statutory and regulatory search identified 14 states with provisions  		regarding negotiated risk agreements (NRAs) or similar concepts, and the  		District of Columbia (<i>hereafter</i>, the states). We first present each of  		the 15 states relevant provisions,<sup><font><a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#noteB1">1</a></font></sup> followed by an overview of the statutory and  		regulatory provisions presented in two tables. <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#tableB1">Table B-1</a>  		summarizes the format required by each state, such as whether or not the  		agreement must be signed, how it relates to the service plan, and whether it  		must be reviewed. <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#tableB2">Table B-2</a> summarizes characteristics  		and requirements, such as whether or not an NRA is required, how it is defined,  		and whether topics such as resident capacity, liability, residency criteria,  		and residents rights are addressed. It also includes information  		categories that are included in the states NRA provisions, such as  		reference to assisted living values, residents capacity to understand the  		agreement, and whether liability waivers are addressed.</p>
<h3>Alaska <i>[AS §§ 47.33]</i></h3>
<p>Alaska states that one of the purposes of its regulations is to  		establish standards that will protect residents of assisted living homes, while  		at the same time promoting an environment that will encourage resident growth  		and independence, without discouraging the establishment and continued  		operation of the homes. Alaskas rules for Assisted Living Homes do not  		specifically define a negotiated or managed risk agreement, but there are two  		sections that refer to recognizing risks and responsibilities for decisions,  		and this meets the intention of NRAs defined in other states.</p>
<p>The rules addressing the content of the assisted living plan states that  		the plan will recognize the responsibility and right of the resident or  		the residents representative to evaluate and choose, after discussion  		with all relevant parties, including the home, the risks associated with each  		option when making decisions pertaining to the residents abilities,  		preferences, and service needs, and recognize the right of the home to evaluate  		and to either consent or refuse to accept the residents choice of  		risks.</p>
<p>The rules addressing health-related services allowed in assisted living  		homes, state that if a resident has received 24-hour skilled nursing care  		for the 45-day limit, the resident or the residents representative may  		elect to have the resident remain in the home without continuation of 24-hour  		skilled nursing care if: (1) the home agrees to retain the resident after  		either the home or the resident or the residents representative have  		consulted with the residents physician; and (2) the home and either the  		resident or the residents representative have discussed the consequences  		and risks involved in the election to remain in the home; and (3) the portion  		of the residents assisted living plan that relates to health-related  		services has been revised to provide for the residents health-related  		needs without the use of 24-hour skilled nursing care, and the revised plan has  		been reviewed by a registered nurse or by the residents attending  		physician.</p>
<h3>Arkansas <i>[A.C.A. §§ 20-10-17]</i></h3>
<p>Arkansas states that one of the purposes of its regulations is to  		encourage the development of facilities that promote the dignity,  		individuality, privacy, and decision-making ability of individuals who reside  		there, and that the services available in these facilities, either directly or  		through contract or agreement, are intended to help residents remain as  		independent as possible.</p>
<p>The regulations define a compliance agreement as a written formal plan  		developed in consideration of shared responsibility, choice and assisted living  		values and negotiated between the resident or his or her responsible party and  		the assisted living facility to avoid or reduce the risk of adverse outcomes  		that may occur in an assisted living environment. The state does not mandate  		the use of a compliance agreement, and notes that it can be used if  		needed. </p>
<p>The state has specific requirements for the compliance agreement  		process:</p>
<p>When the resident evaluation indicates that there is a high probability  		that a choice or action of the resident has resulted or will result in any of  		the outcomes of placing the resident or others at risk, leading to adverse  		outcomes, violating the norms of the facility or program or the majority of the  		residents, or any combination of the events, the assisted living facility  		shall:</p>
<ul><li>Identify the specific concern(s).</li>
<li>Provide the resident or his or her responsible party (and if the  		  resident agrees, the residents family) with clear, understandable  		  information about the possible consequences of his or her choice or  		  action.</li>
<li>Negotiate a compliance agreement with the resident or his or her  		  responsible party that will minimize the possible risk and adverse consequences  		  while still respecting the residents preferences. Nothing in this  		  provision requires a facility to successfully negotiate a compliance  		  agreement.</li>
<li>Document the process of negotiation and, if no agreement can be  		  reached, the lack of agreement and the decisions of the parties involved.</li>
</ul><p>Any compliance agreements negotiated, or attempted to be negotiated,  		with the resident or his or her responsible party shall address the following  		areas in writing:</p>
<ul><li>Consequence to resident--any situation or condition that is or should  		  be known to the facility that involves a course of action taken or desired to  		  be taken by the resident contrary to the practice or advice of the facility and  		  could put the resident at risk of harm or injury.</li>
<li>The probable consequences if the resident continues the choice or  		  action identified as a cause for concern.</li>
<li>The resident or his or her responsible partys preference  		  concerning how the situation is to be handled and the possible consequences of  		  action on that preference.</li>
<li>What the facility will and will not do to meet the residents  		  needs and comply with the residents preference to the identified course  		  of action.</li>
<li>Alternatives offered by the assisted living facility or resident or  		  his or her responsible party to reduce the risk or mitigate the consequences  		  relating to the situation or condition.</li>
<li>The agreed upon course of action, including responsibilities of both  		  the resident or his or her responsible party and the facility.</li>
<li>The resident or his or her responsible partys understanding and  		  acceptance of responsibility for the outcome from the agreed upon course of  		  action and written proof that the resident or his or her responsible party is  		  making an informed decision, free from coercion, and that the refusal of the  		  resident or his or her responsible party to enter into a compliance agreement  		  with the facility, or to revise the compliance agreement or to comply with the  		  terms of the compliance agreement may result in discharge from the  		  facility.</li>
<li>The date the agreement is executed and, if needed, the timeframes in  		  which the agreement will be reviewed.</li>
</ul><p>The regulations define responsible parties as individuals  		who agree to act on behalf of a resident or applicant for the purposes of  		making decisions regarding the needs and welfare of the resident or  		applicant.</p>
<p>The occupancy admission agreement can be terminated under any one of  		several conditions, including: the resident or his or her responsible  		party refuses to enter into a negotiated compliance agreement, refuses to  		revise the compliance agreement when there is a documented medical reason for  		the need of a negotiated compliance agreement or revision thereto, or refuses  		to comply with the terms of the compliance agreement.</p>
<p>The regulations state that residents may not remain in an assisted  		living facility if their condition requires 24-hour nursing care or other  		services that an assisted living facility is not authorized by law to provide.  		It specifically states that this prohibition shall apply even if the  		resident is willing to enter into an agreement to relieve the facility of  		responsibility or otherwise manage the risk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the regulations state that an assisted living  		facility may retain a resident whose condition requires episodic, 24-hour  		nursing care, or who becomes incompetent or incapable of recognizing danger,  		summoning assistance, expressing need or making care decisions provided that  		the facility ensures that a number of requirements are met, including  		that both the service agreement and compliance agreement, if required, is  		signed by the guardian and the health care agent or the agent with power of  		attorney, if any</p>
<p>Under a provision titled, Bill Of Rights, the regulations  		state that residents be given the opportunity to refuse medical treatment  		or services after the resident or his or her responsible party is advised by  		the person providing services of the possible consequences of refusing  		treatment or services, and acknowledges that he or she understands the  		consequences of refusing treatment or services. A compliance agreement is  		not listed as a requirement in such a situation.</p>
<h3>Delaware <i>[Del. Regs 16-2 § 63.0 et seq]</i></h3>
<p>Delaware defines Managed/NRAs as a signed document between the  		resident and the facility, and any other involved party, which describes  		mutually agreeable action balancing resident choice and independence with the  		health and safety of the resident or others.</p>
<p>Shared Responsibility is defined as a concept that residents and  		assisted living facilities share responsibility for planning and  		decision-making affecting the resident.</p>
<p>The state requires that the resident who signs a service agreement  		must be able to comprehend and perform their obligations under the  		agreement. The regulations state that the service agreement shall  		be based on the concepts of shared responsibility and resident choice. To  		participate fully in shared responsibility, residents shall be provided with  		clear and understandable information about the possible consequences of their  		decision-making. If a residents preference or decision places the  		resident or others at risk or is likely to lead to adverse consequences, a  		managed/negotiated risk agreement section may be included in the service  		agreement.</p>
<p>The regulations specify that a managed managed/NRA must meet the  		following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>the risks are tolerable to all parties participating in the  		  development of the managed/NRA;</li>
<li>mutually agreeable action is negotiated to provide the greatest  		  amount of resident autonomy with the least amount of risk; and</li>
<li>the resident living in the facility is capable of making choices and  		  decisions and understanding consequences.</li>
</ul><p>If a managed/NRA is made a part of the service agreement, it shall:</p>
<ul><li>clearly describe the problem, issue or service that is the subject of  		  the managed/NRA;</li>
<li>describe the choices available to the resident as well as the risks  		  and benefits associated with each choice, the assisted living facilitys  		  recommendations or desired outcome, and the residents desired  		  preference;</li>
<li>indicate the agreed-upon option;</li>
<li>describe the agreed upon responsibilities of the assisted living  		  facility, the resident, and any third parties;</li>
<li>become a part of the service agreement, be signed separately by the  		  resident, the assisted living facility, and any third party with obligations  		  under the managed/NRA that the third party is able to fully comprehend and  		  perform; and</li>
<li>include a time frame for review.</li>
</ul><p>The assisted living facility shall have sufficient staff to meet its  		responsibilities under the managed/NRA.</p>
<ul><li>The assisted living facility shall not use managed/NRAs to provide  		  care to residents with needs beyond the capability of the facility. A  		  managed/NRA shall not be used to supersede any requirements of these  		  regulations. </li>
<li>The assisted living facility shall make no attempt to use the  		  managed/negotiated risk portion of the service agreement to abridge a  		  residents rights or to avoid liability for harm caused to a resident by  		  the negligence of the assisted living facility and any such abridgement or  		  disclaimer shall be void.</li>
</ul><h3>District of Columbia <i>[DC Code Ann. § 44-101  		&amp; 102 &amp; 106]</i></h3>
<p>The District of Columbia states that its regulations should be  		interpreted in accordance with the following philosophy of care:</p>
<ul><li>The design of services and environment should acknowledge that a  		  significant number of residents may have some form of cognitive impairment.  		  Services and environment should offer a balance between choice and safety in  		  the least restrictive setting.</li>
<li>Both the program and environment should support resident dignity,  		  privacy, independence, individuality, freedom of choice, decision making,  		  spirituality, and involvement of family and friends.</li>
</ul><p>Shared responsibility is defined as: </p>
<ul><li>A process to deal with disagreements, wherein the resident, or  		  the residents surrogate, and the ALR arrive at an acceptable balance  		  between residents desire for independence and the facilitys  		  legitimate concerns for safety. The purpose of shared responsibility is to  		  provide complete information to the resident and the surrogate so that the  		  parties can arrive at an informed agreement of which services are to be  		  provided and in what manner.</li>
<li>A formal written agreement that outlines the responsibilities  		  and actions of all parties. The agreement is a process for resolving  		  discrepancies between the individual residents right to independence and  		  the providers concerns for the safety and well being of the individual  		  and others.</li>
</ul><p>Additional regulations state that residents have the right:</p>
<ul><li>to engage in a shared responsibility agreement with the ALR  		  (assisted living residence), which is acceptable to the resident and the ALR  		  and does not violate any applicable law; </li>
<li>to refuse to participate in any service once the potential  		  consequences of such participation have been explained and a shared  		  responsibility agreement has been reached, if necessary, between the resident,  		  the surrogate, and the ALR.</li>
</ul><p>The regulations provide additional guidance on the use of shared  		responsibility agreements, specifying that whenever disagreements arise  		as to lifestyle, personal behavior, safety, and service plans the ALR staff,  		resident or surrogate, and other relevant service providers shall attempt to  		develop a shared responsibility agreement. A shared responsibility  		agreement represents a tool for ALRs to recognize an individual residents  		right to autonomy by respecting his or her right to make individual decisions  		regarding lifestyle, personal behavior, and individual service plans. </p>
<p>In some cases, a residents decision may involve increased risk of  		personal harm and therefore potentially increase the risk of liability by the  		ALR absent an agreement between the resident and ALR concerning such decisions  		or actions. In such instances the ALR shall:</p>
<ul><li>explain to the resident, or surrogate, why the decision or action may  		  pose risks and suggest alternatives to the resident; and</li>
<li>discuss with the resident, or surrogate, how the ALR might mitigate  		  potential risks.</li>
</ul><p>If, after consultation with the ALRa resident decides to pursue a  		course of action, such as refusal of services, that may involve increased risk  		of personal harm and conflict with the ALRs usual responsibilities, the  		ALR shall:</p>
<ul><li>Describe to the resident the action or range of actions subject to  		  negotiation.</li>
<li>Negotiate a shared responsibility agreement, with the resident as a  		  full partner, acceptable to the resident and the ALR, that meets all reasonable  		  requirements implicated. The shared responsibility agreement shall be signed by  		  the resident or surrogate and the ALR.</li>
</ul><p>The regulations state that when shared responsibility agreements are  		necessary, they shall be included in the individualized service plan.</p>
<h3>Florida <i>[Fla Stat. Ann. §§  		400.402]</i></h3>
<p>Assisted living facilities in Florida that are licensed to provide  		extended congregate care services shall: </p>
<ul><li>Adopt and follow policies and procedures that maximize resident  		  independence, dignity, choice, and decision making to permit residents to age  		  in place to the extent possible, so that moves due to changes in functional  		  status are minimized or avoided. </li>
<li>Allow residents or, if applicable, a residents representative,  		  designee, surrogate, guardian, or attorney in fact to make a variety of  		  personal choices, participate in developing service plans, and share  		  responsibility in decision making, and implement the concept of  		  managed risk.</li>
</ul><p>Florida defines managed risk as the process by which the facility  		staff discuss the service plan and the needs of the resident with the resident  		and, if applicable, the residents representative or designee or the  		residents surrogate, guardian, or attorney in fact, in such a way that  		the consequences of a decision, including any inherent risk, are explained to  		all parties and reviewed periodically in conjunction with the service plan,  		taking into account changes in the residents status and the ability of  		the facility to respond accordingly.</p>
<p>The state defines shared responsibility as a method for exploring  		the options available to a resident within a facility and the risks involved  		with each option when making decisions pertaining to the residents  		abilities, preferences, and service needs, thereby enabling the resident and,  		if applicable, the residents representative or designee, or the  		residents surrogate, guardian, or attorney in fact, and the facility to  		develop a service plan which best meets the residents needs and seeks to  		improve the residents quality of life.</p>
<h3>Hawaii <i>[Haw. Admin. R. 11-90]</i></h3>
<p>Hawaii states that three principles are to be applied in assisted living  		facilities:</p>
<ul><li>aging in place,</li>
<li>negotiated plan of care, and</li>
<li>managed risk.</li>
</ul><p>The state defines choice as viable options created for residents  		to enable them to exercise greater control over their lives. Managed risk  		is defines as a formal process of negotiating and developing a plan to  		address resident needs, decisions, or preferences to reduce the probability of  		a poor outcome for the resident or of putting others at risk for adverse  		consequences.</p>
<p>The state does not mention risk as part of its definition of a  		negotiated plan of care or service plan or agreement. However, it states that  		the service plan must be a formal process that includes recognition of  		the residents capabilities and choices.</p>
<h3>Illinois <i>[210 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 9/5 &amp; 9/10  		&amp; AC 77.295]</i></h3>
<p>Illinois states that assisted living establishments and shared housing  		establishments are based on a social model that promotes dignity,  		individuality, privacy, independence, autonomy, and decision-making ability,  		and the right to negotiate risk.</p>
<p>The regulations state that assisted living, which promotes  		resident choice, autonomy, and decision making, should be based on a contract  		model designed to result in a negotiated agreement between the resident or the  		residents representative and the provider, clearly identifying the  		services to be provided. This model assumes that residents are able to direct  		services provided for them and will designate a representative to direct these  		services if they themselves are unable to do so. This model supports the  		principle that there is an acceptable balance between consumer protection and  		resident willingness to accept risk and that most consumers are competent to  		make their own judgments about the services they are obtaining.</p>
<p>Regulation of assisted living establishments and shared housing  		establishments must be sufficiently flexible to allow residents to age in place  		within the parameters of this Act. The administration of this Act and services  		provided must therefore ensure that the residents have the rights and  		responsibilities to direct the scope of services they receive and to make  		individual choices based on their needs and preferences. These establishments  		shall be operated in a manner that provides the least restrictive and most  		homelike environment and that promotes independence, autonomy, individuality,  		privacy, dignity, and the right to negotiated risk in residential  		surroundings.</p>
<p>The state defines negotiated risk as the process by which a  		resident, or his or her representative, may formally negotiate with providers  		what risks each are willing and unwilling to assume in service provision and  		the residents living environment. The provider assures that the resident  		and the residents representative, if any, are informed of the risks of  		these decisions and of the potential consequences of assuming these  		risks. It further defines a NRA as a binding  		agreementdescribing conditions or situations that could put the resident  		at risk of harm or injury, and describing the residents agreement  		with the establishment for how those conditions or situations are to be  		handled.</p>
<p>Illinois distinguished NRA from risk management, which is defined as a  		process by which an establishment assesses and addresses potential  		liability.</p>
<p>The regulations also specify the required content of NRAs, noting that  		they shall be signed by the resident or the residents representative and  		the licensee and shall describe the following:</p>
<ul><li>the problem, issue or service that is the subject of the  		  agreement;</li>
<li>the choices available to the resident, as well as the major risks and  		  consequences associated with each choice;</li>
<li>the resulting agreement;</li>
<li>the responsibilities of the establishment and the resident and any  		  other involved individual; and </li>
<li>a time frame for review.</li>
</ul><p>The regulations further state that a NRA:</p>
<ul><li>may be negotiated or renegotiated at any time during the  		  residents stay in the establishment and may initiate a reevaluation of  		  the service delivery plan;</li>
<li>shall be limited to a residents individual care and personal  		  environment;</li>
<li>shall not create a risk to the health, safety, or welfare of other  		  residents and shall not infringe upon the rights of other residents; and </li>
<li>shall not waive other regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Several additional provisions reference NRAs.</p>
<ul><li>Those relating to physicians assessments state that when an  		  assessment is completed for any reason required by regulation (e.g., when a  		  significant change in condition occurs, all current negotiated risk  		  agreements shall be renegotiated as necessary).</li>
<li>Those relating to requirements that are triggered when a significant  		  change in the residents condition, which is defined as a change that is  		  substantial enough to indicate to a reasonable person that current  		  supports and services are insufficient, taking into account the residents  		  wishes as addressed in any negotiated risk agreements in effect.</li>
<li>Those relating to the service plan state that the establishment  		  shall respect and accept the residents choices regarding the service  		  plan, and service plans shall address any risk being  		  negotiated.</li>
<li>Those relating to rights state that residents have the right to  		  direct his or her own care and negotiate the terms of his or her own  		  care, and to refuse services unless such services are court ordered  		  or the health, safety, or welfare of other individuals is endangered by the  		  refusal, and to be advised of the consequences of that  		  refusal.Additionally, the regulations specify that nothing  		  in this Part limits a residents ability to direct his or her own care and  		  negotiate the terms of his or her own care. Residents have the right to refuse  		  certain services or approaches that would otherwise be recommended based on the  		  physicians assessment if the resident has received clear information  		  regarding the risks and benefits of such a choice and the choice does not put  		  other residents or staff at risk. Disclosure of the risks of refusing services  		  or approaches must be documented in the service plan.</li>
</ul><h3>Iowa <i>[Iowa Admin. Code r. 321-27]</i></h3>
<p>Iowa defines assisted living to include encouragement of family  		involvement, tenant self-direction, and tenant participation in decisions that  		emphasize choice, dignity, privacy, individuality, shared risk, and  		independence.</p>
<p>The regulations require facilities to disclose their managed risk policy  		prior to occupancy. The state requires assisted living program to have a  		managed risk statement which includes the tenants or responsible  		persons signed acknowledgment of the shared responsibility for  		identifying and meeting needs and the process for managing risk and upholding  		tenant autonomy when tenant decision making may result in poor outcomes for the  		tenant or others.</p>
<h3>New Jersey <i>[NJ Admin. Code. Title §§ 8:36  		and NJ Stat. § 30:13-8.1 (2003)]</i></h3>
<p>New Jerseys regulations state that assisted living promotes  		resident self direction and participation in decisions that emphasize  		independence, individuality, privacy, dignity, and homelike surroundings.  		The state defines managed risk agreements and related concepts as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Bounded choice means limits placed on a residents choice  		  as a result of an assessmentwhich indicates that such residents  		  choices or preferences place the resident or others at a risk of harm or lead  		  to consequences which violate the norms of the facility or program or the  		  rights of others.</li>
<li>Managed risk means the process of balancing resident choice and  		  independence with the health and safety of the resident and other persons in  		  the facility or program. If a residents preference or decision places the  		  resident or others at risk or is likely to lead to adverse consequences, such  		  risks or consequences are discussed with the resident, and, if the resident  		  agrees, a resident representative, and a formal plan to avoid or reduce  		  negative or adverse outcomes is negotiated.</li>
<li>Managed risk agreement means the written formal plan developed in  		  consideration of shared responsibility, bounded choice and assisted living  		  values, and negotiated between the resident and the facility or program to  		  avoid or reduce the risk of adverse outcomes which may occur in an assisted  		  living environment.</li>
</ul><p>Additional provisions regarding managed risk agreements state that: </p>
<ul><li>The choice and independence of action of a resident may need to  		  be limited when a residents individual choice, preference and/or actions  		  are identified as placing the resident or others at risk, lead to adverse  		  outcome and/or violate the norms of the facility or program or the majority of  		  the residents.</li>
<li>When the resident assessment processindicates that there is a  		  high probability that a choice or action of the resident has resulted or will  		  result in any of the preceding, the assisted living residence, comprehensive  		  personal care home or assisted living program shall: (1) identify the specific  		  cause(s) for concern; (2) provide the resident (and if the resident agrees, the  		  residents family or representative) with clear, understandable  		  information about the possible consequences of his or her choice or action; (3)  		  seek to negotiate a managed risk agreement with the resident (or legal  		  guardian) that will minimize the possible risk and adverse consequences while  		  still respecting the residents preferences; and (4) document the process  		  of negotiation and, if no agreement can be reached, the lack of agreement and  		  the decisions of the parties involved.</li>
</ul><p>The state requires that managed risk agreements include: </p>
<ul><li>the specific cause(s) for concern;</li>
<li>the probable consequences if the resident continues the choice and/or  		  action identified as a cause for concern;</li>
<li>the residents preferences;</li>
<li>possible alternatives to the residents current choice and/or  		  action;</li>
<li>the final agreement reached by all parties involved; and</li>
<li>the date the agreement is executed and, if needed, the time frames in  		  which the agreement will be reviewed.</li>
</ul><p>New Jersey also references NRAs in its training requirements for  		assisted living administrators, who are required to complete: (1) at  		least 40 hours in assisted living administrator training, which shall  		cover a range of topics, including shared responsibility and managed  		risk, and (2) a practicum, consisting of a minimum of 16 hours, at  		a New Jersey licensed assisted living facility which shall include satisfactory  		completion of a resident service needs assessment, service plan and risk  		management agreement.</p>
<p>New Jersey regulations clearly state that any provision or clause  		waiving or limiting the right to sue for negligence or malpractice in any  		admission agreement or contract between a patient and a nursing home or  		assisted living facility, whether executed prior to, on or after the effective  		date of this act, is hereby declared to be void as against public policy and  		wholly unenforceable, and shall not constitute a defense in any action, suit or  		proceeding.</p>
<h3>Ohio <i>[Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 3721]</i></h3>
<p>Ohio regulations state that a residential care facility may enter  		into a risk agreement with a resident or the residents sponsor. Under a  		risk agreement, the resident or sponsor and the facility agree to share  		responsibility for making and implementing decisions affecting the scope and  		quantity of services provided by the facility to the resident. The facility  		also agrees to identify the risks inherent in a decision made by a resident or  		sponsor not to receive a service provided by the facility. A risk agreement is  		valid only if it is made in writing.</p>
<p>The state requires residential care facilities that use risk agreements  		to provide prospective residents (or their sponsors) a written explanation of  		the policy and the provisions that may be contained in a risk agreement. The  		facility must obtain a signed acknowledgement that the individual has received  		the information.</p>
<p>Additional regulations link risk agreements with the provision of  		personal care services, stating that residential care facilities shall  		provide personal care services to its residents who require those  		services, unless the resident and the facility have entered into a risk  		agreementor the resident has refused services. Furthermore,  		if a resident requires certain personal care services that the  		residential care facility does not offer, the facility must first meet  		with the resident and her responsible party (if appropriate). Depending on the  		results of a resident evaluation, there are three possible outcomes: the  		facility or the resident shall arrange for the services to be provided, the  		facility shall transfer the resident to an appropriate setting or discharge the  		resident, or the facility and the resident may enter into a risk agreement if  		the facility has a policy of entering into such agreements.</p>
<h3>Oklahoma <i>[Okla. Admin. Code § 310:663]</i></h3>
<p>The code governing assisted living centers specifies that if  		residents choices or decisions place them or others at risk or are  		likely to lead to an adverse consequence the center is required to:  		(1) advise the resident and the residents representative of such risk or  		consequences, (2) specify the cause for concern, (3) discuss the concern with  		the resident and representative, if any, and (4) attempt to negotiate a written  		agreement that minimizes risk and adverse consequences and offers alternatives  		while respecting resident preferences. Both agreements and lack of agreements  		must be documented.</p>
<h3>Oregon <i>[Or. Admin. R. 411-056]</i></h3>
<p>Oregon defines assisted living to include a program approach that  		promotes resident self-direction and participation in decisions that emphasize  		choice, dignity, privacy, individuality, and independence.</p>
<p>The state defines managed risk as a process by which a  		residents high-risk behavior or choices are reviewed with the resident.  		Alternatives to and consequences of the behavior or choices are explained to  		the resident and the residents decision to modify behavior or accept the  		consequences is documented. The service plan is defined as a separate  		document, a written plan for services that reflects the residents  		capabilities, choices and if applicable, measurable goals and managed risk  		issues; and includes agreed upon actions if a managed risk plan is  		developed.</p>
<p>In the section on residents rights, the regulation states that  		residents are to be given informed choice and opportunity to select or  		refuse service and to accept responsibility for the consequences; Oregon  		rules regarding residents ability to enter into such an agreement state  		that facilities are required to identify the need for and develop a managed  		risk plan following the facilitys established guidelines and procedures.  		They require that managed risk plans include:</p>
<ul><li>an explanation of the cause(s) of concern; </li>
<li>the possible negative consequences to the resident and/or  		  others;</li>
<li>a description of resident preference(s);</li>
<li>possible alternatives/interventions to minimize the potential risks  		  associated with the residents current preference/action;</li>
<li>a description of the services the facility will provide to  		  accommodate the residents choice or minimize the potential risk; and</li>
<li>the final agreement, if any, reached by all involved  		  parties.</li>
</ul><p>The state also requires the facility to involve the resident, the  		residents designated representative and others as indicated, to develop,  		implement and review the managed risk plan. The residents preferences  		shall take precedence over those of a family member(s). A managed risk plan  		shall not be entered into or continued with or on behalf of a resident who is  		unable to recognize the consequences of his/her behavior or choices. The  		managed risk plan shall be reviewed at least quarterly.</p>
<p>The regulations state that a criterion for involuntary move-outs is  		resident behavior or actions that repeatedly and substantially interfere with  		the rights or well being of other residents, after the facility has documented  		prudent and reasonable interventions that it has attempted to address the  		problem.</p>
<h3>Vermont <i>[ALR, § 7102. Statutes, Title 33, Part  		5, Chapter 71]</i></h3>
<p>Vermont defines assisted living to include a program that promotes  		resident self-direction and active participation in decision-making while  		emphasizing individuality, privacy and dignity.</p>
<p>Negotiated risk is defined as a formal, mutually-agreed upon,  		written understanding that results after balancing a residents choices  		and capabilities with the possibility that those choices will place the  		resident at risk of harm. Negotiated risk does not constitute a waiver of  		liability. Licensees are required to establish policies and procedures  		regarding the negotiated risk agreement process, including the identification  		of the responsible staff person.</p>
<p>Additional provisions state that negotiated risk discussions must be  		resident specific, and that:</p>
<ul><li>Whenever the licensee determines that a residents  		  decision, behavior or action places the resident or others at risk of harm, the  		  licensee shall initiate a service negotiation process to address the identified  		  risk and to reach a mutually agreed-upon plan of action.</li>
<li>The licensee shall initiate the negotiated risk process by notifying  		  the resident and, if applicable, the legal representative, verbally and in  		  writing. The licensee shall also give notice to the resident and legal  		  representative that the state Long Term Care Ombudsman is available to assist  		  in the process. </li>
<li>If the licensee and the resident reach agreement, the mutually agreed  		  upon plan shall be in writing.</li>
<li>The written plan shall be dated and signed by both parties to the  		  negotiation.</li>
</ul><p>NRAs are clearly linked to the care plan. The care plan shall  		describe the assessed needs and choices of the resident and shall support the  		residents dignity, privacy, choice, individuality, and independence. The  		licensee shall review the plan at least annually, and whenever the  		residents condition or circumstances warrant a review, including whenever  		a residents decision, behavior or action places the resident or others at  		risk of harm, or the resident is incapable of engaging in a negotiated risk  		agreement.</p>
<p>Provisions on involuntary discharge reference NRAs, stating that  		the licensee shall not initiate a discharge because a residents  		choice might pose a risk if the resident is competent and the choice is  		informed and poses a danger or risk only to the resident. Otherwise, an  		involuntary discharge of a resident may occur only when the resident presents a  		serious threat to self that cannot be resolved through care planning and the  		resident is incapable of engaging in a negotiated risk agreement; or when  		the resident presents a serious threat to residents or staff that cannot  		be managed through interventions, care planning or negotiated risk agreements  		in the assisted living residence. If the licensee and the resident are not able  		to reach agreement, the licensee shall notify the state long term care  		ombudsman if the failure to reach agreement results in a notice of  		discharge.</p>
<h3>Washington <i>[Wash. Admin. Code § 388]</i></h3>
<p>The Washington State code for boarding homes has a number of assisted  		living service standards stating that the contractor shall ensure that  		both the physical environment and the delivery of assisted living services are  		designed to enhance autonomy in ways which reflect personal and social values  		of dignity, privacy, independence, individuality, choice and decision-making of  		residents. Additionally, contractors are required to: (1) provide  		resident services in a manner that supports managed risk which includes the  		residents right to take responsibility for the risks associated with  		decision-making; and (2) develop a formal written, negotiated plan to decrease  		the probability of a poor outcome when a residents decision or preference  		places the resident or others at risk, leads to adverse consequences, or  		conflicts with other residents rights or preferences.</p>
<p>Washington State also requires that service planning be negotiated.  		The boarding home must provide the care and services as agreed upon in  		the negotiated service agreement to each resident unless a deviation from the  		negotiated service agreement is mutually agreed upon between the boarding home  		and the resident or the residents representative at the time the care or  		services are scheduled. Residents are permitted to refuse any particular  		service unless adjudged incompetent or otherwise found to be legally  		incapacitated to direct his or her own service plan and changes in the service  		plan, and so long as such refusal is documented in the record of  		the resident.</p>
<p>Washington State clearly states that facilities may not waive a  		residents rights: the boarding home must not require or ask the  		resident or the residents representative to sign any contract or  		agreement, including a negotiated service or risk agreement, that purports to  		waive any rights of the resident or that purports to place responsibility or  		liability for losses of personal property or injury on the resident. In  		another section, the rules state that no long term care facility or  		nursing facility shall require or request residents to sign waivers of  		potential liability for losses of personal property or injury, or to sign  		waivers of residents rights set forth in this chapter or in the  		applicable licensing or certification laws.</p>
<p>Provisions relating to the coordination of health care services also  		reference NRAs: when authorizations to release health care information  		are not obtained, or when an external health care provider is unresponsive to  		the boarding homes efforts to coordinate services, the boarding home  		must: (1) document the boarding homes actions to coordinate services; (2)  		provide notice to the resident of the risks of not allowing the boarding home  		to coordinate care with the external provider; and (3) address known associated  		risks in the residents negotiated service agreement.</p>
<p>When coordinating care or services, the boarding home must (1)  		integrate relevant information from the external provider into the  		residents assessment, and when appropriate, negotiated service agreement;  		and (2) respond appropriately when there are observable or reported changes in  		the residents physical, mental, or emotional functioning.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin <i>[Wis. Stat. Ann. § 89-Chapter  		50]</i></h3>
<p>Wisconsins statute on residential care apartment complexes  		specifies that they should operate in a manner that protects  		tenants rights, respects tenant privacy, enhances tenant self-reliance  		and supports tenant autonomy in decision-making including the right to accept  		risk.</p>
<p>A risk agreement is defined as a binding stipulation identifying  		conditions or situations which could put the tenant at risk of harm or injury  		and the tenants preference for how those conditions or situations are to  		be handled. Wisconsin differs from other states by requiring a signed,  		jointly NRA with each tenant by the date of occupancy as a protection for  		both the individual tenant and the residential care apartment complex  		that that identifies situations that could put the resident at risk and  		for which the resident understands and accepts responsibility.</p>
<p>Because tenants need to be competent to understand and express their  		needs and preferences, enter into a service agreement and understand and accept  		risk, the state specifies restrictions on who can be admitted to a residential  		care apartment complex. The following persons may not be admitted unless the  		person being admitted shares an apartment with a competent spouse or other  		person who has legal responsibility for the individual:</p>
<ul><li>a person who has a court determination of incompetence and is subject  		  to guardianship,</li>
<li>a person who has an activated power of attorney for health care,  		  and</li>
<li>a person who has been found by a physician or psychologist to be  		  incapable of recognizing danger, summoning assistance, expressing need or  		  making care decisions.</li>
</ul><p>Incapable of making care decisions means unable to understand  		ones own needs for supportive, personal or nursing services; to choose  		what, if any, services one wants to receive to meet those needs; and to  		understand the outcome likely to result from that choice. The term refers to  		the ability to make a decision and not to the content or result of the  		decision.</p>
<p>Regulations state that a residential care apartment complex may retain a  		tenant who becomes incompetent or incapable of recognizing danger, summoning  		assistance, expressing need or making care decisions, provided that the  		facility ensures all of the following:</p>
<ul><li>That adequate oversight, protection and services are provided for the  		  individual.</li>
<li>That the tenant has a guardian appointed under, or has an activated  		  power of attorney for health care, or a durable power of attorney, or both. The  		  activated power of attorney for health care or durable power of attorney shall,  		  either singly or together, substantially cover the persons areas of  		  incapacity.</li>
<li>That both the service agreement and risk agreement are signed by the  		  guardian and by the health care agent or the agent with power of attorney, if  		  any.</li>
</ul><p>The state specifies that the risk agreements must identify and state all  		of the following: </p>
<ul><li>Risk to tenants. </li>
<li>Any situation or condition which is or should be known to the  		  facility which involves a course of action taken or desired to be taken by the  		  tenant contrary to the practice or advice of the facility and which could put  		  the tenant at risk of harm or injury.</li>
<li>The tenants preference concerning how the situation is to be  		  handled and the possible consequences of acting on that preference.</li>
<li>What the facility will and will not do to meet the tenants  		  needs and comply with the tenants preference relative to the identified  		  course of action.</li>
<li>Alternatives offered to reduce the risk or mitigate the consequences  		  relating to the situation or condition.</li>
<li>The agreed upon course of action, including responsibilities of both  		  the tenant and the facility.</li>
<li>The tenants understanding and acceptance of responsibility for  		  the outcome from the agreed upon course of action.</li>
<li><i>Unmet needs</i>. Any needs identified in the comprehensive  		  assessment which will not be provided for by the facility, either directly or  		  under contract.</li>
<li><i>Notice regarding enforcement in registered facilities</i>. For  		  registered facilities only, notice that the department does not routinely  		  inspect registered facilities or verify their compliance with this chapter and  		  does not enforce contractual obligations under the service or risk  		  agreements.</li>
</ul><p>Wisconsin states clearly that a risk agreement may not waive any  		provision of this chapter or any other right of the tenant, but also states an  		obligation to negotiate in good faith: neither the tenant nor the  		facility shall refuse to accept reasonable risk or insist that the other party  		accept unreasonable risk. The rules state that the risk agreement must be  		signed and dated by both an authorized representative of the residential care  		apartment complex and by the tenant or the tenants guardian and agents  		designated under an activated power of attorney for health care or a durable  		power of attorney. </p>
<p>Risk agreements must be updated when the tenants condition or  		service needs change in a way that may affect risk, as indicated by a review  		and update of the comprehensive assessment, by a change in the service  		agreement or at the request of the tenant.</p>
<p>Several additional provisions reference NRAs.</p>
<ul><li>Services shall be appropriate to the needs, abilities and  		  preferences of tenants as identified in the comprehensive assessment, service  		  agreement and risk agreement.</li>
<li>Services shall be provided in a manner which respects tenant privacy,  		  enhances tenant self-reliance and supports tenant autonomy in decision-making,  		  including the right to accept risk.</li>
<li>A tenant may contract for additional services not included in the  		  service agreement from providers of the tenants choice, so long as the  		  tenant informs the facility, complies with applicable facility policies and  		  procedures and agrees to have the arrangements reflected in the risk  		  agreement.</li>
<li>A comprehensive assessment shall be performed prior to admission for  		  each person seeking admission as a basis for developing the service agreement  		  and the risk agreement. The comprehensive assessment shall identify and  		  evaluate various factors relating to the persons need and preference for  		  services, including situations or conditions which could put the tenant at risk  		  of harm or injury.</li>
<li>A tenants capabilities, needs and preferences identified  		  in the comprehensive assessment shall be reviewed at least annually to  		  determine whether there have been changes that would necessitate a change in  		  the service or risk agreement. The review may be initiated by the facility, the  		  county department, or at the request of or on the behalf of the  		  tenant.</li>
<li>Residents may choose which services are included in the service  		  agreement, including the right to refuse services provided that the refusal  		  would not endanger the health or safety of the other tenants. They have  		  the right to receive services consistent with the service agreement and risk  		  agreement.</li>
<li>Except as provided for in the service agreement or risk agreement,  		  the facility may not interfere with the tenants ability to manage  		  his or her own medications or, when the facility is managing the medications,  		  to receive all prescribed medications in the dosage and at the intervals  		  prescribed by the tenants physician and to refuse a medication unless  		  there is a court order.</li>

<ol><li><font><b>NRA Process/Format Defined</b>. This column  				  indicates whether the states rules describe the process or format for an  				  NRA. Specific means that the state mandates the format or process  				  for an NRA (e.g., New Jersey defines six areas that must be addressed in  				  writing). General means that the state gives broad guidance for the  				  process or format but does not provide specific guidance (e.g., Ohio indicates  				  that risks associated with resident decisions must be addressed and recorded in  				  writing, but do not specify a process or format). --- means the  				  state does not address the process or form of an NRA.</font></li>
<li><font><b>Capacity to Understand NRA is Addressed</b>:  				  This column indicates whether the rules reference the capacity (or ability) of  				  the resident to understand the NRA. Specific means that the rules  				  state parameters (e.g., Oregon rules indicate that a risk agreement should not  				  be entered into or continued on behalf of an individual who is unable to  				  recognize the consequences of his/her behavior or choices; the District of  				  Columbia explains that the design of services should recognize that a  				  significant number of residents might be cognitively impaired and that services  				  should offer a balance between safety and choice). General means  				  that a state references capacity but does not provide specific guidance (e.g.,  				  Alaska and New Jersey state that NRAs should be explained or written in  				  understandable language). --- means the state does not address  				  resident capacity regarding NRAs.</font></li>
<li><font><b>Provider Liability Addressed</b>: This  				  column indicates whether a states rules explain that an NRA may  				  <b>not</b> represent a waiver of liability. Specific means that a  				  state prohibits a waiver of liability (e.g., Delaware mandates that the  				  facility shall make no attempt to use the managed/negotiated portion of  				  the service agreement to abridge a residents right or to avoid liability  				  for harm caused to a resident by the negligence of the assisted living  				  facility). General means that a states rules indicate  				  that NRAs can not waive provider responsibilities under other  				  requirements of the rules (e.g., Illinois states that NRAs shall not  				  waive the requirements of this Part). --- means the state  				  does not address liability waivers.</font></li>
<li><font><b>Residency Criteria Addressed</b>: This  				  column indicates whether the states rules contain guidance on NRAs use  				  when the issue involves residency criteria, i.e., rules about who may be  				  admitted to an assisted living facility. Specific means that the  				  rules contain guidance on how NRAs interact with residency criteria (e.g.,  				  Arkansas rules prohibit the admission or retention of individuals who require  				  24-hour nursing care, even if the resident is willing to enter into an  				  agreement to relieve the facility of responsibility or otherwise manage  				  risk). General means that the rules reference risk and  				  residency (e.g., Risk assessment is part of the process for determining  				  admission and retention). --- means the state does not address how  				  NRAs interact with residency criteria.</font></li>
<li><font><b>Role of NRA in Discharge Addressed</b>: This  				  column indicates whether a states rules contain guidance on NRAs use when  				  the issue involves discharge criteria (i.e., rules that define how and if  				  residents may be given notice to move out). Specific means that the  				  rules contain guidance on how NRAs interact with discharge requirements (e.g.,  				  Arkansas rules cited in Note 4 are one example; Vermont takes a different  				  approach, indicating that the facility may not discharge a resident because the  				  residents choice might pose a risk, if the resident is competent, the  				  choice is informed, and the risk is to the resident only). General  				  means that rules reference NRAs and discharge (e.g., Alaska rules consider risk  				  assessment to be part of the service plan, and a resident may be discharged if  				  the home can no longer meet the residents needs as specified in the plan;  				  Oregon allows involuntary move-out only after the assisted living provider has  				  tried prudent and reasonable interventions, which must be documented).  				  --- means the state does not address how NRAs interact with  				  discharge.</font></li>
<li><font><b>Residents Rights Reference NRAs</b>:  				  This column indicates whether state rules regarding residents rights  				  refer to risks or NRA principles. Specific means that the rules  				  reference NRAs (e.g., DC specifies that residents have the right to engage in a  				  shared responsibility agreement and the right to refuse services once the  				  potential consequences have been discussed and the resident has agreed to  				  them). General means that the rules residents rights section  				  references risk taking (e.g., Alaska specifies that the resident has the right  				  to participate in the assisted living plan, and the plan must include a  				  discussion of potential risks related to choices). --- means the  				  state rules do not mention risk in the residents rights  				  section.</font></li>

<p>Only a few national organizations other than providers have official  		policy positions regarding negotiated risk agreements (NRAs). The 27 experts  		contacted for this study (see <a href="study-negotiated-risk-agreements-assisted-living-final-report.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>), identified  		only three organizations with written policy positions: the AARP, the Assisted  		Living Federation of America (ALFA), and the National Senior Citizens Law  		Center (NSCLC). </p>
<p>The AARP (2003) incorporates negotiated risk into their definition of  		assisted living, which includes A process for legitimate negotiated risk  		agreements between facilities and residents, allowing residents to enhance  		their autonomy and independence and providers to maintain a safe and  		appropriate environment. </p>
<p>The ALFA supports the use of NRAs as a tool for operationalizing  		autonomy and choice in a realistic way, especially given that we have a  		litigious society. They published a guidebook, written by attorney  		Ken Burgess (2000) and have model documents available for purchase. In the  		forward to the guidebook, then ALFA president Karen Wayne explained that,  		negotiated risk agreements are emerging as an important tool in promoting  		resident choice and autonomy and thus in furthering the mission of the assisted  		living industry. </p>
<p>The National Senior Citizens Law Center (NSCLC, 2004) has a new  		policy strongly opposing NRAs. This group clearly identifies this practice as  		inappropriate, focusing almost entirely on risk agreements as a tool for  		waiving facility liability. The statement is presented here in its  		entirety:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The National Senior Citizens Law Center is opposed to any use  		  of negotiated risk agreements. Negotiated risk agreements release long-term  		  care facilities from their legal responsibilities to provide adequate care,  		  without providing any benefit to facility residents. Negotiated risk agreements  		  are illegal and unenforceable under existing law, which prohibits a business  		  from using a consumer contract to release itself from the legal responsibility  		  to provide adequate care and safe accommodations. Admission to a long-term care  		  facility is traumatic and confusing for residents and their families.  		  Particularly given the vulnerability of residents during the time of admission,  		  negotiated risk agreements are one-sided and unfair. Residents should be able  		  to make choices regarding their lives without signing away their  		  rights.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While only three organizations have formal published policies, the  		positions of 27 organizations that voted on the Assisted Living Workgroup (ALW)  		proposed shared responsibility agreement definition provides  		additional information about organizations that are for or  		against this practice. We list these groups below.</p>
<p>The ALW proposed a definition for shared responsibility  		agreements that defined such agreements as a tool for  		communication and resident empowerment when there is a deviance  		from an accepted standard and there is a lack of consensus on a  		course of action between the resident and the provider and the risk  		of an adverse outcome is high (ALW, 2003: 152). The goals for shared  		responsibility agreements included resident empowerment, realistic assessment  		of potential harm and outcomes, building consensus, and providing appropriate  		documentation of choices made, options presented, and provider  		responsibilities. The recommendation explained that as an extension of the  		service plan, the assisted living facility staff and the resident may choose to  		enter into a shared responsibility agreement, that the agreement should cover  		the exception not the rule, that shared responsibility shall not be a  		waiver of liability, and that the shared responsibility agreement should  		include a written statement to identify resident choice, provider concerns,  		alternatives, final agreement, follow-up, and signatures.</p>
<p>While some of the following organizations lack a formal policy position  		on the topic, each made their formal policy position regarding risk agreements  		clear in their support or opposition of the ALW shared responsibility  		agreement recommendation, which failed by three votes to achieve the  		two-thirds majority vote required to be formally adopted. Of the 27  		organizations that voted on the recommendation (out of 50+ participating  		organizations), the following 15 organizations supported the ALWs shared  		responsibility agreement recommendation:</p>
<ol><li>American Association of Retired Persons</li>
<li>American Association of Homes and Services for Aging</li>
<li>American Seniors Housing Association</li>
<li>Assisted Living Federation of America</li>
<li>Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers</li>
<li>Catholic Health Association of the United States</li>
<li>Consumer Consortium on Assisted Living</li>
<li>JHACO</li>
<li>National Association for Home Care</li>
<li>National Center for Assisted Living</li>
<li>National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization</li>
<li>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</li>
<li>NCB Development Corporation</li>
<li>Paralyzed Veterans of America</li>
<li>Pioneer Network</li>
</ol><p>The first 12 of these organizations provided a supplemental position to  		the Shared Responsibility Agreement, including an emphasis on the process as  		a tool for communication, noting that NRAs empower residents  		to exercise choices (ALW, 2003: 153) by providing a mechanism  		through which assisted living providers can operationalize and preserve  		the values of independence, autonomy, and choice when the wishes  		and preferences of the resident must be balanced against a normally  		unacceptable level of risk (ALW, 2003: 154). These supporters also  		included a statement that nothing in such agreements [should absolve]  		providers from responsibility for negligent actions (p.153). These  		organizations stated that ultimately, the shared responsibility agreement  		process is simply a systemized method of accommodating individual resident  		choices, or finding acceptable alternatives to those choices, and the propriety  		of its use depends upon the unique facts and circumstances pertaining to each  		resident (ALW, 2003: 153).</p>
<p>The last three organizations on the above list of those supporting the  		ALW shared responsibility agreement recommendation provided a supplemental  		position emphasizing that risk agreements may be a useful means of weighing  		resident preferences against their health and safety needs. Further they  		indicated that the negotiated risk process responds to the legislative  		and policy directive to foster and promote these resident values and helps  		deliver the promise of assisted living (ALW, 2003: 154).</p>
<p>The 12 organizations opposing NRAs at the ALW include:</p>
<ol><li>American Geriatrics Society</li>
<li>Association of Health Facility Survey Agencies</li>
<li>Center for Medicare Advocacy</li>
<li>National Association for Regulatory Administration</li>
<li>National Association of Local LTC Ombudsmen</li>
<li>National Association of Social Workers</li>
<li>National Association of State Ombudsman Programs</li>
<li>National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform</li>
<li>National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare</li>
<li>National Conference of Gerontological Nurse Practitioners</li>
<li>National Network of Career Nursing Assistants</li>
<li>National Senior Citizens Law Center</li>
</ol><p>These 12 groups provided a supplemental position that the recommendation  		and NRAs are confusing and unnecessary and that rather than expand  		resident choice and control, NRAs actually limit resident choices and are  		designed to protect the interests of the facility. Further, these organizations  		argued that, it is unclear what type of real-world fact pattern would  		require the use of a shared responsibility agreement, particularly  		given the availability and general acceptance of the care planning  		process (ALW, 2003: 153). Finally, these groups raised a concern that  		such agreements existed only to serve the financial interests of assisted  		living providers, shared responsibility agreements are designed almost  		exclusively to protect the facility from regulatory requirements and legal  		action (p.153).</p>
<h3>ALW Negotiated Risk Agreement Recommendation Assisted  		Living Workgroup Report to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging</h3>
<p><b>Recommendation: D.13 Shared Responsibility Agreement</b></p>
<p><b><i>Recommendation</i></b> (2/3s Majority agreement not reached)</p>
<p>Shared Responsibility Agreements are a tool for communications. They may  		be exercised when the resident* is not complying with the goals and outcomes  		listed in the Service Plan or the Policies and Procedures of the ALR. As an  		extension of the Service Plan, the ALR and the resident* may enter into a  		Shared Responsibility Agreement. The Shared Responsibility Agreements should  		cover the exception not the rule.</p>
<p>Shared responsibility shall not be a waiver of liability. A shared  		responsibility agreement is simply a written agreement between both  		parties--the Assisted Living Residence and the resident*--which memorializes  		the parties discussions and agreements regarding the residents  		preferences and how they will be accommodated in the community.</p>
<p>Shared Responsibility Agreements may be used when any or all of the  		following are true:</p>
<ul><li>There is a deviance from an accepted standard.</li>
<li>There is a lack of consensus on a course of action.</li>
<li>The risk of an adverse outcome is high.</li>
</ul><p>The goals of the Shared Responsibility Agreement are:</p>
<ul><li>Empower the resident to exercise choice regarding service delivery  		  (within established boundaries).</li>
<li>Identify resident preferences.</li>
<li>Perform a realistic assessment of potential harm due to resident  		  preferences.</li>
<li>Identify potential outcomes.</li>
<li>Seek consensus around decision.</li>
<li>Document process of negotiation and decision.</li>
<li>Provide acknowledgement of the discussion.</li>
</ul><p>A Shared Responsibility Agreement should:</p>
<ul><li>Identify the cause for concern.</li>
<li>Identify the probable consequences of the residents  		  choice.</li>
<li>Make clear what the resident wants.</li>
<li>Describe possible alternatives.</li>
<li>Set forth the final agreement.</li>
<li>Decide what staff will be notified of the agreement and how often  		  follow-up is necessary.</li>
<li>Agreement is signed by the ALR and the resident*.</li>
</ul><p><i>Rationale</i></p>
<p>The agreement itself is an extension of the service plan and the end  		product of a process in which the Assisted Living Residence, or the ALR and the  		resident together, identify a resident preference (e.g., to engage in or avoid  		certain activities or behaviors) which the ALR normally would not recommend or  		allow, or would remove, because they involve unacceptable risk to the health  		and safety of the resident or others in the ALR.</p>
<p><i>Implementation</i></p>
<p>Ultimately, the shared responsibility agreement process is simply a  		systemized method of accommodating individual resident choices, or finding  		acceptable alternatives to those choices, and the propriety of its use depends  		upon the unique facts and circumstances pertaining to each resident.</p>
<p>Recognition of the need for a shared responsibility agreement normally  		arises in one of three ways. In some cases, a resident will verbally express to  		ALR staff a desire to engage in certain activities or behaviors that normally  		would be prohibited. In other cases, ALR staff may raise the issue where a  		resident repeatedly engages in behaviors which normally would not be allowed  		for that resident. Occasionally, third parties such as family members, or  		ombudsman or other resident advocates may suggest a shared responsibility  		agreement to resolve complaints or concerns raised by a resident or family.</p>

<p><b><i>Supplemental Postions for D.13</i></b></p>
<p><i>Supplemental Postion #1</i></p>
<p>Many states are requiring shared responsibility or negotiated risk  		agreements as a part of the management of services in assisted living  		residences. Recommendation D.13 does an excellent job of describing the  		legitimate uses of such agreements, they are a tool for  		communication between residents and providers where residents are  		empowered to exercise choices in activities and expect services according to  		their preferences.</p>
<p>The recommendation also makes it very clear what are not legitimate uses  		of such agreements: Shared responsibility shall not be a waiver of  		liability. While providers may reasonably use such agreements as part of  		their risk management policy, nothing in such agreements absolves providers  		from responsibility for negligent actions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful part of the recommendation is its detailed  		outline of a process for negotiating such agreements. Many states require  		negotiated risk or shared responsibility agreements without providing guidance  		on how they should and should not be developed. The process recognizes that the  		provider has a responsibility to identify the consumers preferences as  		well as potential risks that may be associated with certain behaviors. The  		process also recognizes that not all courses of action are possible or  		reasonable, but that resident preferences should be honored even when the  		provider does not believe them to be in the residents best interest.</p>
<p>The undersigned organizations believe that this recommendation strikes  		the right balance between the residents preferences and the  		providers responsibility to provide services within a safe environment.  		It provides much needed guidance to states as they move into this relatively  		uncharted area of the law.</p>
<p><i>AARP, American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging,  		American Seniors Housing Association, Catholic Health Association of the United  		States, Consumer Consortium on Assisted Living, NCB Development Corporation,  		Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers, National Center for  		Assisted Living, National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, National  		Multiple Sclerosis Society, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Pioneer  		Network</i></p>
<p><i>Supplemental Postion #2</i></p>
<p>We oppose this failed recommendation. This recommendation is confusing  		and unnecessary, and seems to reduce a residents right to make  		choices.</p>
<p>It is unclear what type of real-world fact pattern would require the use  		of a shared responsibility agreement, particularly given the  		availability and general acceptance of the care planning process. Although  		shared responsibility agreements purportedly are designed to  		advance resident choice, they actually diminish resident choice, as shown by  		the fact that they are to be employed when the resident is not complying  		with the goals and outcomes listed in the Service Plan or the Policies and  		Procedures of the ALR, or there is a deviance from an accepted  		standard or a lack of consensus on a course of action.</p>
<p>The rationale emphasizes that the shared responsibility  		process is to be employed when the assisted living residence disagrees with  		decisions made by the resident, even if the only person affected is the  		resident himself or herself. This raises the inference, confirmed by the debate  		within the Workgroup, that shared responsibility agreements are designed almost  		exclusively to protect the facility from regulatory requirements and legal  		action. There is no need for this confusing and self-contradictory  		recommendation. Resident/facility disputes are currently being addressed  		through care planning in assisted living residences around the country.</p>
<p><i>American Geriatrics Society, Association of Health Facility Survey  		Agencies, Center for Medicare Advocacy, National Association for Regulatory  		Administration, National Association of Local Long Term Care Ombudsmen,  		National Association of Social Workers, National Association of State Ombudsman  		Programs, National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, National  		Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Conference of  		Gerontological Nurse Practitioners, National Network of Career Nursing  		Assistants, National Senior Citizens Law Center.</i></p>
<p><i>Supplemental Postion #3</i></p>
<p>We support the recommendation. Negotiated risk agreements are becoming  		recognized as one of the primary tools through which assisted living providers  		can operationalize and preserve the values of independence, autonomy, and  		choice upon which the assisted living model rests so directly. Statutory and/or  		regulatory mandates in virtually every state direct both regulators and  		providers to further and nourish resident independence and autonomy in assisted  		living communities. The negotiated risk process focuses the attentions of  		resident, community staff, resident families, resident advocates, and  		regulators via a systematized process on one central issue--what are the wishes  		and preferences of the resident as balanced against the residents health  		and safety needs. By so doing, the negotiated risk process responds to the  		legislative and regulatory directive to foster and promote these resident  		values and helps deliver the promise of assisted living.</p>
<p>The negotiated risk process is an individualized planning process  		designed to maximize a residents ability to make his or her own decisions  		by facilitating discussions and analysis of a residents stated choices  		where those choices create a normally unacceptable level of risk for the  		resident. Negotiated risk is not a waiver of liability on the part of the  		provider of its obligations under governing regulations.</p>
