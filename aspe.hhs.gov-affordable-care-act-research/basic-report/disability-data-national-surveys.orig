<h3>A. Purpose of the Report</h3>
<p>Federal agencies, policy makers, and researchers use information from  		national surveys for a variety of purposes, including monitoring the health and  		well-being of the population, designing new public programs and policies, and  		understanding the circumstances of vulnerable populations in order to assess  		the effectiveness of programs. One such vulnerable population is people with  		disabilities. A large and growing share of the United States population is  		affected by disability, and disability prevalence increases considerably as  		people age. Statistics from the 2009 <a href="#ACS">American Community  		Survey</a> (ACS) indicate that about 36 million (12 percent) of individuals age  		5 and over residing in the community have disabilities. Disability prevalence  		ranges from 5.2 percent among children ages 5-17 to 37.4 percent among adults  		age 65 and over (Census Bureau 2011). With medical improvements that extend  		life expectancy and the aging of the baby boom generation, the prevalence of  		disability is increasing and will continue to rise for the foreseeable  		future.</p>
<p>Because disability can greatly affect a persons productivity,  		economic well-being, and reliance on publicly funded programs and supports, a  		large amount of public expenditures is devoted to this population. Recent  		estimates indicate that in fiscal year 2008 the Federal Government spent  		approximately $357 billion on a wide range of programs that provide services to  		working-age adults with disabilities (Livermore et al. 2011). In light of this,  		it is especially important for policy makers to have access to a wide variety  		of high-quality data on people with disabilities in order to better understand  		the needs of this population, assess how existing programs and policies are  		performing, and plan for the future.</p>
<p>The Federal Government collects extensive survey and administrative data  		pertaining to disability that is used by federal agencies for a variety of  		purposes. However, existing national disability-related survey and  		administrative data are limited in their ability to meet the needs of federal  		programs and policy makers. Such limitations include inadequate and  		inconsistent measures of disability, small sample sizes or no data on  		particular subpopulations of interest, lack of information on specific topics,  		very limited longitudinal information, poor-quality survey data on program  		participation and service use, and lack of access to and linkages with  		administrative data (Livermore and She 2007). One potential response to the  		shortcomings of existing disability data is the fielding of a national  		disability survey or similar large-scale disability data collection effort. The  		<a href="#NHIS-D">National Health Interview Survey on Disability</a> (NHIS-D),  		fielded from 1994 to 1997, represents one such effort; it is the only  		large-scale national disability survey data collection effort ever conducted  		for the United States general population.</p>
<p>This report was prepared as part of a project sponsored by the U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), to assess the need for developing and fielding  		another national disability survey data collection effort. It presents the  		findings from one of the projects major activities designed to review the  		disability-related information that is available in existing national  		surveys.</p>
<h3>B. Methods and Sources of Information</h3>
<p>To develop an understanding of the scope and limitations of existing  		disability data, we conducted a review of 40 national surveys that cover a  		range of topics likely to be of importance to the policies, programs, and  		issues that affect the lives of people with disabilities. An important goal of  		this review was to provide written summaries documenting the key features of  		each survey that could act as a quick-reference guide for ASPE and other  		federal agency staff in their discussions and planning around disability data  		collection activities.</p>
<p>In selecting the surveys to be reviewed, we were guided by the following  		criteria:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The survey was federally-sponsored and national in scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The survey was fielded in 2000 or later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If not fielded since 2000, the survey contains significant  			 disability-related content or other information of particular relevance to  			 individuals with disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Due to resource constraints, not all possible surveys meeting the above  		criteria were reviewed. In the discussion of the surveys presented in  		<a href="#overview">Chapter II</a>, we note instances of surveys that meet the  		above criteria that were not included in our initial review. A tabular,  		quick-reference summary of the features of the 40 surveys is provided in  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>; more detailed text summaries of each survey  		are provided in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">II. OVERVIEW OF EXISTING DISABILITY-RELATED SURVEY  		DATA</a></h2>
<p>Many existing national surveys collect disability-related information,  		and some do so in great detail. There is substantial variation across surveys  		in terms of target populations, the disability measures used, topics covered,  		frequency, and design. Here, we provide an overview of the 40 national,  		federally-sponsored surveys we reviewed for this study, focusing on the  		disability-related content. A list of the surveys reviewed is shown in  		<a href="#tableII.1">Table II.1</a>. A tabular summary of the features of the  		40 surveys is presented in <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a> and more detailed  		information on each survey is provided in <a href="#appendB">Appendix  		B</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p>We identified several additional surveys that we did not review but  		which met the criteria for inclusion in our review. These excluded surveys  		include the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, Healthcare  		Cost and Utilization Project, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System,  		National Home and Hospice Care Survey, National Hospital Discharge Survey,  		National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, National Survey of Americas  		Families, National Survey on Family Growth, Postsecondary Education Quick  		Information System, Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study,  		Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, Survey of Veteran  		Enrollees Health and Reliance upon VA, and the Youth Risk Behavior  		Surveillance System.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, we provide an overview of the 40 surveys  		reviewed for this study. The discussion is divided into four sections: ongoing  		national general population surveys; surveys of health, disability, aging, and  		long-term care subpopulations; surveys of youth, education, and transition  		subpopulations; and other surveys. The final two sections describe several new  		survey efforts and provide some general observations about the nature and  		content of the 40 surveys, respectively. </p>
<h3>A. Ongoing National General Population Surveys</h3>
<p>The United States government sponsors a number of national surveys that  		are representative of all or most of the United States population. These  		surveys are conducted on a regular basis and represent the core of the  		governments national data collection efforts to monitor the  		characteristics, health, and well-being of the United States population We  		reviewed 17 general population surveys, including <a href="#ACS">ACS</a>,  		<a href="#AHS">American Housing Survey</a> (AHS), <a href="#ATUS">American Time  		Use Survey</a> (ATUS), <a href="#BRFSS">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance  		System</a> (BRFSS), <a href="#Census">Census</a>, <a href="#CE">Consumer  		Expenditure Survey</a> (CE), <a href="#CPS">Current Population Survey</a>  		(CPS), <a href="#MEPS">Medical Expenditure Panel Survey</a> (MEPS),  		<a href="#NCVS">National Crime Victimization Survey</a> (NCVS),  		<a href="#NHANES">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a>  		(NHANES), <a href="#NHES">National Household Education Survey</a> (NHES),  		<a href="#NHIS">National Health Interview Survey</a> (NHIS), <a href="#NSDUH">National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a> (NSDUH),  		<a href="#NSFH">National Survey of Families and Households</a> (NSFH),  		<a href="#PSID">Panel Study of Income Dynamics</a> (PSID), <a href="#SCF">Survey of Consumer Finances</a> (SCF), and <a href="#SIPP">Survey  		of Income and Program Participation</a> (SIPP). </p>
<p><i><b>1. Coverage of United States Households</b></i></p>
<p>Generally, the ongoing national surveys cover the household population  		or noninstitutional population, however, the <a href="#ACS">ACS</a> (since  		2006), <a href="#AHS">AHS</a>, <a href="#Census">Census</a>, and the 1996  		<a href="#MEPS">MEPS</a> also cover certain nonhousehold or group quarters  		populations. Most ongoing national surveys include individuals of all ages in  		their samples, but in many cases a single household member provides information  		on all other family members, and in several instances children under a  		particular age are excluded. Surveys in this category are fielded regularly,  		some annually and others less frequently (for example, every 4-8 years). Most  		have data available from 2007 or later. Seven of the 17 surveys in this  		category produce longitudinal data, and all but one (the <a href="#PSID">PSID</a>) can generate time-series data. About half of these  		support estimates at regional or state levels. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Disability-Related Content</b></i></p>
<p>In some cases, surveys that are not explicitly concerned with health  		include disability indicators. The <a href="#ACS">ACS</a>, <a href="#AHS">AHS</a>, and <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> use a common set of six  		questions to identify hearing impairments, vision impairments, physical  		disabilities, mental disabilities, self-care disabilities, and independent  		living limitations. These questions were added to the <a href="#AHS">AHS</a>  		and <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> very recently. As a result, the surveys can be used  		to compare the population with disabilities with the rest of the population, or  		those with one category of disability against those with another. However, they  		do not allow for descriptions of disabilities or limitations, or for certain  		distinctions, such as whether a limitation in decision making is due to  		cognitive impairment, a developmental disability, or mental health.</p>
<p>Some surveys contain very little disability information. The  		<a href="#CE">CE</a> and <a href="#SCF">SCF</a> collect disability information  		only in the context of income and expenditures. In both cases, respondents are  		asked about disability income (for example, Social Security Disability  		Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), workers  		compensation, and Veterans compensation). In the <a href="#CE">CE</a>,  		respondents are also asked about medical expenditures; in both surveys,  		respondents can indicate disability as a reason for not working (if they  		indicate they are not working), but in neither survey are all respondents  		directly queried about their disability status. While these surveys can be used  		to identify the population with a disability that prevents work or with  		expenditures on given services or devices associated with certain limitations  		or conditions, their utility for disability research is limited due to their  		lack of disability indicators. The <a href="#ATUS">ATUS</a> has a similar  		issue; however, its sample is derived from the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> and so it  		is possible to match responses to the new <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> disability  		questions to the <a href="#ATUS">ATUS</a> sample. As of 2010, the  		<a href="#Census">Census</a> no longer collects information on disability; the  		<a href="#ACS">ACS</a> is intended to provide the information to replace  		disability and other questions previously included on the <a href="#Census">Census</a> long form.</p>
<p>The <a href="#BRFSS">BRFSS</a>, <a href="#MEPS">MEPS</a>,  		<a href="#NHANES">NHANES</a>, <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>, <a href="#PSID">PSID</a>, and <a href="#SIPP">SIPP</a> contain a substantial  		amount of information on health and disability, but even among these surveys  		the level of detail varies considerably. Some, like the <a href="#BRFSS">BRFSS</a>, collect relatively simple information on issues  		relevant to disability, such as functional limitations, use of special  		equipment, and need for assistance or care. At the other end of the spectrum,  		the <a href="#SIPP">SIPP</a> and the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> contain numerous  		measures of health status and disability. </p>
<p>Other surveys in this group collect information on a particular category  		of disability or disability information only from some respondents. The  		<a href="#NHES">NHES</a> collects information about disabilities that might  		affect respondents education. Questions address whether they have a  		disability that affects their ability to learn, or have ever needed or used  		specialized services. The <a href="#NSDUH">NSDUH</a> solicits information on  		issues of mental health, particularly substance abuse, but does not address any  		other types of disabilities. The <a href="#NSFH">NSFH</a> focuses on  		relationship dynamics among family members, so questions on disability address  		needs for care and assistance, care provided by family members, symptoms of  		depression, and drug and alcohol abuse. The <a href="#NCVS">NCVS</a> asks  		detailed questions about disability, but only if the respondent has been the  		target of a crime during the reference period. </p>
<p>Information on program participation, education, and employment appears  		in nearly all of the ongoing national surveys. Relatively few, however, provide  		detailed information on learning disability, social participation,  		transportation, and whether the respondents are considered by themselves or  		others to have a disability. </p>
<h3>B. Surveys on Health, Disability, Aging, and Long-Term  		Care</h3>
<p>A number of national surveys focus on health, disability, aging, and  		long-term care topics, but are conducted less frequently than the ongoing  		surveys described above and/or focus only on specific subpopulations. We  		reviewed 11 such surveys, including <a href="#HRS">Health and Retirement  		Study</a> (HRS), <a href="#LSOA">Longitudinal Study of Aging</a> (LSOA),  		<a href="#MCBS">Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey</a> (MCBS), <a href="#HOS">Medicare Health Outcomes Survey</a> (HOS), <a href="#NBS">National  		Beneficiary Survey</a> (NBS), <a href="#NCS">National Comorbidity Survey</a>  		(NCS), <a href="#NHIS-D">NHIS-D</a>, <a href="#NLTCS">National Long Term Care  		Survey</a> (NLTCS), <a href="#NNHS">National Nursing Home Survey</a> (NNHS),  		<a href="#NSCF">National Survey of SSI Children and Families</a> (NSCF), and  		<a href="#NS-CSHCN">National Survey of Children with Special Health Care  		Needs</a> (NS-CSHCN). With the exception of the <a href="#NCS">NCS</a>, all of  		these studies use samples restricted to particular subpopulations: older age  		groups, those receiving specific types of benefits or care, and those  		screened-in based on their reported health status and needs. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Coverage of United States Households</b></i></p>
<p>The surveys in this group are generally conducted less frequently than  		the ongoing national surveys described above. However, with the exception of  		the <a href="#NHIS-D">NHIS-D</a>, which was only conducted in 1994-1996, and  		the <a href="#LSOA">LSOA</a>, which was last conducted in 2000, data are  		available from 2004 or later. Seven of the 11 surveys produce time-series data,  		and six produce longitudinal data. Six of the 11 surveys support regional or  		state-level estimates. </p>
<p>The <a href="#HRS">HRS</a>, <a href="#LSOA">LSOA</a>, and  		<a href="#NLTCS">NLTCS</a> are longitudinal studies that examine changes as  		individuals age. The <a href="#HRS">HRS</a> targets people over age 50 and  		follows them based on their birth cohort. Two <a href="#LSOA">LSOA</a> studies  		followed individuals age 55 or older from the 1984 and 1994 <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> samples until 1990 and 2000, respectively. The  		<a href="#NLTCS">NLTCS</a> used a sample of individuals ages 65 and older drawn  		from Medicare eligibility files in 1982 and followed them until 2004. </p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#NLTCS">NLTCS</a>, several other surveys  		derive their samples from program participation populations. The  		<a href="#MCBS">MCBS</a> draws its sample from Medicare beneficiaries, the  		<a href="#HOS">HOS</a> from Medicare Advantage enrollees, the <a href="#NBS">NBS</a> from SSI and SSDI beneficiaries, and the <a href="#NSCF">NSCF</a> from children receiving SSI benefits. Though not  		specifically a program participant sample, the <a href="#NNHS">NNHS</a> derives  		its sample from nursing home residents, many of whom are Medicaid and Medicare  		beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The <a href="#NHIS-D">NHIS-D</a> and <a href="#NS-CSHCN">NS-CSHCN</a>  		screened respondents based on their own or their childs health and  		disability status. The first Phase of the <a href="#NHIS-D">NHIS-D</a> was a  		supplement to the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>, administered to all respondents in  		1994 and 1995. If individuals were identified as having or potentially having a  		disability, they were screened into Phase II, which collected more detailed  		information related to disability. The <a href="#NS-CSHCN">NS-CSHCN</a>  		similarly asked questions of a nationally representative sample of children in  		households. Another general population survey that screened for particular  		health conditions is the <a href="#NCS">NCS</a>. The <a href="#NCS">NCS</a>  		screened respondents for a variety of mental health disorders based on a  		lengthy questionnaire.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Disability-Related Content</b></i></p>
<p>Because they are intended to provide information related to disability  		and health, these surveys include more extensive information on disability than  		most national household surveys. All include information on physical and  		functional limitations, limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs),  		cognitive impairment or developmental disorders, specific conditions, health,  		and health insurance. Less common topics include substance use, abuse, and  		dependence (three surveys); bed days (three surveys); learning disabilities  		(two surveys); and whether the respondents are considered by themselves or  		others to have a disability (one survey).</p>
<p>A variety of disability-related topic areas are covered in surveys  		focused on aging. In the <a href="#HRS">HRS</a>, details are collected on  		disabilities and limitations experienced before age 16, those present at the  		time of interview, and the impact of disability and aging on work activity. The  		<a href="#LSOA">LSOA</a> focused on physical and cognitive impairments and how  		respondents cope with challenges as they age. The <a href="#NLTCS">NLTCS</a>  		focused on the factors that cause individuals to move from community settings  		into long-term care facilities, including health, functional status, medical  		expenditures, and sources of care from family members and others in the  		community.</p>
<p>The <a href="#MCBS">MCBS</a>, <a href="#HOS">HOS</a>, <a href="#NBS">NBS</a>, <a href="#NSCF">NSCF</a>, and <a href="#NNHS">NNHS</a>  		include detailed questions about disability, targeted to the populations  		surveyed, and most have links to administrative records from the relevant  		program. For example, the <a href="#NBS">NBS</a> includes questions about  		barriers to work and use of U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) work  		incentives and is linked to SSA records, and the <a href="#NSCF">NSCF</a>  		focuses on the services needed and used by children who qualify for SSI.  		Information from the <a href="#NNHS">NNHS</a> provides a picture of the needs  		and characteristics of nursing home residents.</p>
<p>For those screened to participate, the <a href="#NHIS-D">NHIS-D</a>,  		<a href="#NS-CSHCN">NS-CSHCN</a>, and <a href="#NCS">NCS</a> collected detailed  		information on participants. Phase II of the <a href="#NHIS-D">NHIS-D</a> asked  		participants to report on particular limitations, their severity, and their  		effects. The <a href="#NS-CSHCN">NS-CSHCN</a> collected additional information  		on those who have more or different medical needs than most children their age  		for those screened-in to the sample. The <a href="#NCS">NCS</a> asks a detailed  		battery of questions related to mental illness as well as questions on physical  		disabilities.</p>
<h3>C. Surveys on Youth and Education</h3>
<p>We reviewed nine surveys on youth and education topics and  		subpopulations, including <a href="#B&amp;B">Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal  		Study</a> (B&amp;B), <a href="#BPS">Beginning Postsecondary Students  		Longitudinal Study</a> (BPS), <a href="#ECLS">Early Childhood Longitudinal  		Survey</a> (ECLS), <a href="#HSLS">High School Longitudinal Study</a> (HSLS),  		<a href="#NELS">National Education Longitudinal Study</a> (NELS),  		<a href="#AddHealth">National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health</a> (Add  		Health), <a href="#NLSY97">National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997</a>  		(NLSY97), <a href="#NLTS2">National Longitudinal Transition Study 2</a>  		(NLTS2), and <a href="#NSCH">National Survey of Childrens Health</a>  		(NSCH). </p>
<p><i><b>1. Coverage of United States Households</b></i></p>
<p>All of these surveys restrict their samples to particular age groups,  		and many focus on even more specific target populations. For example, the  		<a href="#B&amp;B">B&amp;B</a> and <a href="#BPS">BPS</a> sampled those graduating  		from and beginning postsecondary education, and the <a href="#HSLS">HSLS</a>  		sampled only students enrolled in the 9thgrade. Nearly all have been fielded  		relatively recently; with the exception of <a href="#NELS">NELS</a>, which was  		last fielded in 2000, data are available from 2007 or later. Only three of the  		nine surveys in this category can produce estimates at the state or regional  		level.</p>
<p>Most of the surveys in this category are sponsored by the Institute of  		Education Sciences (IES) in the U.S. Department of Education and are  		longitudinal in nature, to track how children and young adults develop over  		time and to relate experiences to outcomes. The major differences across the  		IES surveys are the age groups and populations of interest. <a href="#B&amp;B">B&amp;B</a> focuses on college graduates, <a href="#BPS">BPS</a> on  		college freshmen, <a href="#HSLS">HSLS</a> on those enrolled in 9thgrade, the  		<a href="#NELS">NELS</a> on those enrolled in 8th grade, and <a href="#ECLS">ECLS</a> on young children, sampled at nine months or at  		kindergarten enrollment. Somewhat different from the other IES studies, the  		<a href="#NLTS2">NLTS2</a> followed secondary students who were receiving  		special education services as they moved into adult roles. Though not sponsored  		by IES, <a href="#NLSY97">NLSY97</a> used a similar sample--youth ages  		12-16--and followed similar outcomes. </p>
<p><a href="#AddHealth">Add Health</a> and the <a href="#NSCH">NSCH</a> are  		focused on issues of health and health care. <a href="#AddHealth">Add  		Health</a> sampled adolescents enrolled in grades 7-12 and collected  		information on how social and behavioral factors influence health over time.  		The <a href="#NSCH">NSCH</a> sampled children under age 18. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Disability-Related Content</b></i></p>
<p>Information on physical and functional limitations, mental and emotional  		disorders or symptoms, and employment appear in all of the surveys on youth and  		education. Seven of the nine surveys cover learning disability, which is  		relatively uncommon in surveys of other populations. None of these surveys  		covers household expenditures and only two cover issues related to substance  		use, abuse, and dependence, or transportation.</p>
<p>Disability content in <a href="#B&amp;B">B&amp;B</a>, <a href="#BPS">BPS</a>, <a href="#HSLS">HSLS</a>, <a href="#NELS">NELS</a>, and  		<a href="#ECLS">ECLS</a> focuses on the services children and youth need and  		receive in school and on the effect of childhood disability on adult outcomes.  		The disability content in <a href="#NLTS2">NLTS2</a> is much more extensive  		than in the other education-focused surveys and includes information on  		limitations as well as on services and accommodations provided by school, work,  		and other sources. </p>
<p><a href="#AddHealth">Add Health</a> and <a href="#NSCH">NSCH</a> include  		content related to physical limitations, symptoms of depression and anxiety,  		and diagnoses. The <a href="#NSCH">NSCH</a> provides a general description of  		childrens health. It includes extensive disability content, including  		limitations, diagnoses, medications prescribed, and services used, as well as  		more general questions on health and health care.</p>
<h3>D. Other Surveys</h3>
<p>In addition to the surveys described above, we reviewed three surveys of  		specific subpopulations: <a href="#NSV">National Survey of Veterans</a> (NSV),  		<a href="#SILJ">Survey of Inmates in Local Jails</a> (SILJ), and  		<a href="#SISCF/SIFCF">Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional  		Facilities</a> (SISCF/SIFCF). These surveys address specific agency needs and  		are useful primarily for research about their specific target populations,  		which are generally not addressed in other surveys. They are conducted  		relatively infrequently and do not support state or regional estimates. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Coverage of United States Households</b></i></p>
<p>The <a href="#NSV">NSV</a> is focused on collecting information for  		developing and evaluating U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs programs. It uses  		a sample of veterans and, starting in 2009, active members of the military as  		well as their families. The <a href="#SILJ">SILJ</a> and <a href="#SISCF/SIFCF">SISCF/SIFCF</a> are nearly identical surveys that collect  		information on inmates in local jails and prisons, respectively, in order to  		evaluate the needs of the incarcerated population and remedy deficiencies in  		correctional institutions. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Disability-Related Content</b></i></p>
<p>Information collected by the <a href="#NSV">NSV</a> includes ADL  		limitations and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) limitations, as  		well as Veterans Administration (VA) disability ratings, sources of health  		insurance, and medical services used. The <a href="#SILJ">SILJ</a> and  		<a href="#SISCF/SIFCF">SISCF/SIFCF</a> include detailed sections on drug and  		alcohol abuse and dependence and on other mental health issues. Some  		information on physical health and physical limitations is also collected.</p>
<p>All three surveys include information on sensory and communication  		limitations, physical and/or functional limitations, mental and emotional  		disorders or symptoms, specific conditions, disability benefit receipt or  		program participation, health, use of services related to health and  		disability, and participation in public programs. None addresses cognitive  		impairment or developmental disorders, social participation or interpersonal  		interaction, use of or need for personal assistance, bed days, household  		expenses, or transportation.</p>
<h3>E. New Survey Efforts</h3>
<p>While many of the surveys listed above continue to collect data, some  		are undergoing significant changes. Three surveys are adding disability  		supplements and two are changing the way the survey collects data. In addition,  		a new survey targeting Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 is in progress. We  		describe these new efforts below.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Modifications to Existing Surveys</b></i></p>
<p>In addition to short supplements on disability, which have appeared in  		various forms since 2008, the 2011 <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> includes a longer  		supplement on functioning and disability. The supplement contains questions on  		the severity of difficulty with particular activities, use of assistive devices  		(for example, a hearing aide or a cane), activity limitations, anxiety and  		depression, and pain. The same questions are being fielded as part of national  		health surveys in several other countries so that comparisons can be made  		across cultures. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is in the process of developing a new  		disability supplement to the 2012 <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>. The focus of the  		supplement is to provide new, detailed information on the employment-related  		issues of people with disabilities. Potential topics include the nature of the  		disability, work history, living arrangements, social environment, family  		background, income, employment counseling and training, assistive technology  		and employer accommodations, telecommuting and transportation, and use of  		government programs. The survey instrument is currently under development and  		its final contents will reflect input from researchers and disability  		advocates.</p>
<p>The <a href="#SIPP">SIPP</a>, conducted by the Census Bureau, is  		currently undergoing major changes. The product of these changes, referred to  		as the Re-Engineered <a href="#SIPP">SIPP</a>, will have a new survey design  		with annual interviews replacing interviews three times a year, and a new  		survey instrument. SSA is sponsoring a disability supplement to the  		Re-Engineered <a href="#SIPP">SIPP</a>. Detailed information about the contents  		of the disability supplement is not yet available, as SSA is scheduled to  		deliver the contents and questions for the survey to the Census Bureau in  		summer 2011.</p>
<p><i><b>2. New Data Collection Efforts</b></i></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education is sponsoring, a new round of data  		collection called the National Longitudinal Transition Survey 2012 (NLTS 2012).  		The NLTS 2012 will build off the questions included in the <a href="#NLTS2">NLTS2</a>, but has a more ambitious sample design. The NLTS 2012  		sample will contain not only youth identified as needing special education  		services, but also two other groups: those with a condition that qualifies them  		for accommodations under Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of  		1973 and other students with no identified disability. This will allow the  		study to gauge how the characteristics, experiences, and outcomes of special  		education students differ from those of the other two groups of youth. The data  		collected in the NLTS 2012 will permit comparisons to data in the  		<a href="#NLTS2">NLTS2</a> and NLTS, to examine changes in the characteristics,  		school experiences, and postsecondary outcomes of special education students.  		</p>
<p>With funding from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) within the  		National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health  		and Westat are conducting the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS).  		The NHATS is a longitudinal survey of Medicare beneficiaries over age 65. The  		goal of the survey is to monitor changes in daily life and activities  		throughout the aging process. Participants will be interviewed once a year on  		topics including living arrangements, economic status and well-being, work  		status and participation in valued activities, quality of life, daily  		activities and help provided with such activities, mobility and use of  		assistive devices, cognitive functioning, health, and health care. During the  		interview, participants will also be asked to conduct activities including  		standing, getting up from a chair, walking, breathing, and memory exercises. In  		addition, the interviewer will record the respondents height, weight, and  		waist circumference. </p>
<h3>F. Commentary on Existing Disability-Related Survey  		Data</h3>
<p>Some general observations based on our review of the 40 surveys include  		the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The specific measures of disability and wording of questions  			 designed to elicit information about a particular type of disability (for  			 example, visual impairment), differ markedly across surveys. Nearly all of the  			 national surveys reviewed have questions that can be used to identify people  			 with disabilities, but a few do not. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A concerted effort is being made to use a uniform set of disability  			 indicators across surveys. The six-question series included in the  			 <a href="#ACS">ACS</a>, <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>, <a href="#AHS">AHS</a>, and  			 <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> supplement is part of this effort. A new supplement in  			 the 2011 <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>, which will include a battery of questions  			 related to disability, represents an effort to make more uniform, descriptive  			 information on disability available across countries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Few surveys contain measures to specifically identify individuals  			 with cognitive or intellectual disabilities. Measures to identify specific  			 health conditions underlying disability also are uncommon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are numerous surveys of specific subpopulations (for example,  			 students, inmates, nursing home residents, and beneficiaries of specific  			 programs) on a variety of disability-related topics. This likely reflects the  			 specific data and information needs of particular agencies and the fact that  			 the general population surveys do not contain large enough samples of  			 individuals in these specific target populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many national surveys have longitudinal components, though most  			 cover a specific subgroup rather than a general population. The <a href="#PSID">PSID</a> and <a href="#HRS">HRS</a> represent the most extensive  			 efforts in that they regularly interview individuals from the time of sampling  			 until death or loss to follow-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New disability supplements to the <a href="#SIPP">SIPP</a> and  			 <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> will increase the information available on employment,  			 economic well-being, and program participation. Two new longitudinal surveys  			 will provide information about the school-to-work transitions of youth and  			 health status changes of Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumption, expenditures, job accommodations, transportation and  			 means for getting around outside of the home, environmental barriers, and  			 community supports are the general topic areas least commonly addressed for  			 people with disabilities in the surveys we reviewed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A final important observation is that a considerable amount of survey  		data is already being collected on disability issues and populations. Finding  		ways to improve, augment, and coordinate these existing mechanisms is an  		important means for addressing the limitations of survey data on  		disability-related issues and populations.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="appendB" id="appendB">APPENDIX B. DETAILED SURVEY SUMMARIES</a></h2>
<h3><a name="ACS" id="ACS">AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY (ACS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the ACS is to collect detailed information on the  		demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics of the United States  		population in order to inform federal and local decision making. It has  		replaced the <a href="#Census">Census</a> long form, which previously collected  		similar data.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS is sponsored by the Census Bureau, U.S. Department of  		Commerce.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS uses a sample drawn from all valid residential housing unit  		addresses in all counties and county equivalents in the 50 states, as well as  		the District of Columbia, and group quarters that appeared in the previous  		<a href="#Census">Census</a>. Examples of group quarters include correctional  		facilities, homeless shelters, group homes, and college dormitories. Domestic  		violence shelters, soup kitchens, regularly scheduled mobile food vans,  		targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations, commercial maritime vessels, natural  		disaster shelters, and dangerous encampments are never sampled. While  		households and small group quarters are eligible to be sampled once every five  		years, large group quarters are eligible for sampling each year.</p>
<p>Detailed data are gathered from up to five residents of a given  		household, including the person in whose name the dwelling is rented or owned,  		or another adult if that person is not available. Ten to 15 individuals are  		surveyed in group quarters, depending on the size of the population residing  		there. Households in reporting areas with small populations are  		oversampled.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS is sent via mail to 3 million households each year, and  		approximately 2 million respond. Data are pooled across three and five-year  		periods to create estimates based on a larger sample. </p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>ACS estimates are available at regional and state levels as well as for  		smaller areas, including school districts, congressional districts, Alaska  		Native Regional Areas, counties, and <a href="#Census">Census</a> tracts.  		Statistics for areas with fewer than 65,000 residents are available only as  		three and five-year estimates, while statistics for areas with fewer than  		20,000 residents are available only as five-year estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS does not follow households or individuals over time.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS is mailed to 250,000 households each month, and data are  		aggregated for each year. In remote locations in Alaska, the survey takes the  		form of in-person interviews, which are scheduled for months in which the  		locations are most accessible.</p>
<p>The ACS has been fully fielded each year since 2005, following a  		large-scale demonstration from 2000-2004 and a smaller test from 1996-1999.  		Some data are available from years before 2005, but they are not necessarily  		complete or nationally representative. The latest data currently available are  		from 2009. Questions about disability changed slightly for the 2008  		survey.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> As a result, a consistent time-series  		for disability prevalence or characteristics of individuals with disabilities  		is only available from 2005 through 2007 and from 2008 onwards. </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS includes information on whether the respondent is deaf or hard  		of hearing, is blind or low-vision, has difficulty walking or climbing stairs,  		has difficulty dressing or bathing, or has difficulty doing errands due to a  		physical, mental, or emotional condition. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS includes information on whether the respondent has difficulty  		concentrating, remembering, or making decisions and if they have difficulty  		doing errands due to a physical, mental, or emotional condition.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS includes information on whether respondents have difficulty  		concentrating, remembering, or making decisions and if they have difficulty  		doing errands due to a physical, mental, or emotional condition.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS includes information on whether respondents have a U.S.  		Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) service-connected disability rating and if  		so, what that rating is (new in 2010); health insurance coverage; Supplemental  		Security Income (SSI) payments; Social Security or Railroad Retirement  		payments; other retirement, survivor, or disability pension payments; and  		whether they are working or looking for work.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS includes information on demographic characteristics such as age,  		sex, Hispanic or Latino origin, race, and relationships between household  		members; information on social characteristics including ancestry, citizenship  		status, disability status, educational attainment, fertility, field of degree,  		grandparents as caregivers, language, marital status and marital history, place  		of birth, school enrollment, migration, veteran status, and year of entry into  		the United States; economic characteristics including class of worker,  		employment status, health insurance coverage, income and earnings, industry,  		journey to work, occupation, poverty, and work status; and information on  		housing characteristics including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  		participation, house- heating fuel, kitchen facilities, owner statistics,  		plumbing facilities, renter statistics, rooms and bedrooms, telephone service  		available, tenure, units in structure, value of home, vehicles available, year  		householder moved into unit, and the year the structure was built.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS is not linked to administrative data. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS provides cross-sectional data for very small areas. It can be  		used to determine the need for programs and funding, and the number of  		potential customers who could be served by a new mode of transportation or  		other service in a given location; to compare income and benefits received for  		those with different limitations, or of those who report limitations and those  		who do not; to estimate changes over time in the percent of the population  		reporting a limitation who are working, receiving benefits, living above or  		below a standard of living (for example, income at 133 percent of the poverty  		line), or are covered by a given source of health insurance. Because most  		questions have been administered consistently over time, the ACS can be used to  		assess changes in population characteristics.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The ACS is also administered in Puerto Rico, where it is called the  		Puerto Rico Community Survey. The six ACS disability questions are also used in  		the <a href="#AHS">AHS</a> and the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="AHS" id="AHS">AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY (AHS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS collects information about the quantity and characteristics of  		housing in America. </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce administers the AHS for  		the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS uses a sample of housing units selected randomly based on 1980  		<a href="#Census">Census</a> data and periodically updated to reflect new  		housing units. The sample includes houses, apartments, manufactured/mobile  		homes, and special living facilities selected from the most recent  		<a href="#Census">Census</a>. The respondent provides information on  		demographic characteristics and characteristics of his or her housing unit and  		the surrounding neighborhood. If the housing unit is vacant, landlords, rental  		agents, or neighbors provide information about the housing unit and  		neighborhood. In 2015, the AHS will draw a new sample based on the 2010  		<a href="#Census">Census</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS uses a national sample of about 50,000 housing units, in  		addition to a cyclical supplemental survey of metropolitan areas. The national  		sample was drawn for the 1985 survey based on the 1980 <a href="#Census">Census</a>, and the Census Bureau continues to update this  		sample with newly constructed housing units by sampling building permits. The  		2007 AHS selected about 60,000 units for interview; however, 5,000 units were  		excluded from the sample due to budgetary constraints. An additional 2,150  		either no longer existed or did not meet the AHS definition for inclusion,  		resulting in an eligible sample size of approximately 53,000 housing units.  		</p>
<p>In addition to the national sample, the AHS surveys a supplemental  		sample of housing units in metropolitan areas. In 2007, approximately 19,000  		housing units were selected for interview in the seven metropolitan areas  		covered by the survey. The metropolitan survey cycles through a set of 21  		areas, surveying each one approximately every six years. The 2007 AHS  		supplemental metropolitan surveys were conducted in Baltimore, Boston, Houston,  		Miami, Minneapolis, Tampa, and Washington, DC. </p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS produces both national and metropolitan area estimates. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Since 1985, the AHS has surveyed a fixed sample of about 50,000 housing  		units. The national sample is surveyed in odd-numbered years. Metropolitan  		areas are revisited about once every six years. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS was first fielded in 1973 as the Annual Housing Survey. Since  		1981, the national survey has been conducted in odd-numbered years. The survey  		was re-designed in 1985 and renamed the AHS. Since then, AHS has used a fixed  		sample of about 50,000 homes. </p>
<p>Since 2007, the metropolitan survey has been conducted in odd-numbered  		years along with the national survey. Prior to this, the metropolitan survey  		was fielded in even-numbered years. </p>
<p>The 1995 and 1978 versions of the AHS include supplemental questions  		about housing and disability. The 1995 AHS collected information about  		limitations, in addition to housing accessibility and the use of assistive  		devices. The 1978 AHS contained items on limitations, medical conditions, and  		availability of household accessibility features. </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS collects information about whether the members of the household  		are deaf or have serious difficulty hearing; are blind or have serious  		difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses; have difficulty doing errands  		alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a physical,  		mental, or emotional condition; have serious difficulty concentrating,  		remembering, or making decisions due to a physical, mental, or emotional  		condition; have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs; or have serious  		difficulty dressing or bathing. These questions were introduced for the first  		time in the 2009 AHS and are permanent additions to the survey. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS collects information about whether the members of the household  		have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because  		of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, or whether they have difficulty  		doing errands alone such as visiting a doctors office or shopping because  		of a physical, mental, or emotional condition. These questions were introduced  		for the first time in the 2009 AHS and are permanent additions to the  		survey.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS collects information about whether the members of the household  		have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because  		of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, or whether they have difficulty  		doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a  		physical, mental, or emotional condition. These questions were introduced for  		the first time in the 2009 AHS and are permanent additions to the survey. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The AHS collects information about disability payments, such as Social  		Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), workers compensation, or  		veterans disability.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> The survey includes  		a separate question about receipt of SSI. </p>
<p>Housing accessibility is covered in the survey. The AHS collects  		information about whether it is possible to enter the household from the  		outside without climbing up or down steps or stairs. The survey also provides  		information about whether assistive or personal care services are provided to  		households in multifamily structures.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics covered in the survey include characteristics of household  		occupants, information on recent moves, neighborhood and housing quality,  		housing unit structural features, size of unit and land, plumbing, appliances,  		heating and cooling equipment, fuels, housing costs (mortgage, rent, taxes),  		remodeling and renovations, and use of housing assistance programs. </p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) produces the  		Income Limits File, linking the AHS public use file (PUF) with HUD  		administrative data. The Income Limits File is publically available.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>With the addition of disability questions in 2009, the AHS data can be  		used to evaluate the current living conditions and housing needs of people with  		self-reported limitations and those receiving disability benefits. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The 1995 and 1978 versions of the AHS include supplemental questions  		about housing and disability. As of 2009, the AHS has permanently added  		questions about six types of physical, cognitive, and mental limitations. </p>
<p>Internal Use Files (IUFs) are also available through the Census Bureau.  		The IUFs include detailed level of geography, as well as disaggregated data not  		included in the PUFs for confidentiality reasons. </p>

<p>The ATUS was first fielded in 2003 and is conducted annually. The survey  		is administered at regular intervals throughout the year. Respondents answer a  		set of questions and also complete a time use diary. The respondent completes  		the time use diary once, reporting all activities of the previous day.<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> The final section of the survey includes rotating  		modules. The U.S. Department of Agriculture sponsored the Eating and Health  		module from 2006 to 2008, with questions focusing on diet and nutrition.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ATUS asks about temporary absences for work, and respondents may  		select that these missed days are due to illness, injury, or medical problems.  		The survey also queries whether a member of the household took a trip for  		medical reasons.</p>
<p>The Eating and Health Module, fielded from 2006 to 2008, provides  		information about height and weight.</p>

<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ATUS provides information about whether the respondent was unable to  		work due to a disability. The respondent is asked if he or she worked at any  		point in the past seven days, and may select disabled as a response option.  		Respondents who report not working due to disability are asked about looking  		for work and if the reported condition prevents working for the next 6 months.  		</p>
<p>ATUS respondents rate their general physical health on a five point  		scale from excellent to poor. </p>
<p>Because the ATUS sample is derived from the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>,  		later years can be linked to the six disability questions recently added to the  		<a href="#CPS">CPS</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics covered in the ATUS include employment during the previous week,  		trips away from home, labor force status, income, and school enrollment. The  		time use diary includes the following activities: sleeping, grooming (self),  		watching TV, working at main job, working at other job, preparing meals or  		snacks, eating and drinking, cleaning the kitchen, laundry, grocery shopping,  		attending religious service, and paying household bills. Respondents provide  		information about how long each activity took, who was with them, and where the  		activity took place. Follow-up questions to the time use diary focus on  		secondary childcare, volunteer work, and work and income-generating  		activities.</p>
<p>The Eating and Health Module covers food preparation and identifies  		which member of the household is the primary grocery shopper and food preparer.  		The survey also provides information on whether children consume food that was  		prepared outside the home, school, or childcare programs. A section of the  		module expands on the time diary and gives details about time spent eating  		(either as the primary activity or concurrently with another activity) and time  		spent drinking beverages (excluding water). </p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The ATUS is not linked to administrative data. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The ATUS can be used to evaluate how people who are not working due to  		disability spend their time compared to people without disabilities who are  		jobless. Using the Eating and Health Module, researches can explore the  		correlation between BMI or nutritional habits and disability. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The ATUS is designed to include rotating modules, funded by other  		government agencies, as the final section of the survey. The U.S. Department of  		Agriculture sponsored the Eating and Health Module from 2006-2008. </p>
<p>The ATUS is linked to the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>. Income questions are  		only asked on the ATUS for respondents who changed jobs or became employed  		since the final <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> interview. Income for all others is  		imputed from the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>. The link to the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>  		also permits use of the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a> disability questions to identify  		people with disabilities in later years of the ATUS.</p>

<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B follows college graduates after they complete their  		bachelors degree and collects information about post-baccalaureate  		education, work experience, and family life. </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B is sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S.  		Department of Education. </p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B uses a nationally representative sample drawn from the National  		Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). The NPSAS sample consists of students  		who are enrolled in postsecondary education at public, private, or for-profit  		institutions offering vocational, two-year or four-year degrees. All students  		who participated in the NPSAS and received, or expected to receive, an  		undergraduate degree during the NPSAS reporting period were eligible to  		participate in the B&amp;B. B&amp;B is administered to college graduates who  		completed their bachelors degree in the year following the NPSAS. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The B&amp;B sample size varies by cohort. The most recent B&amp;B cohort  		will be followed from 2008 to 2012. The series of interviews administered to  		this cohort is referred to as B&amp;B:08/12 and currently includes  		approximately 19,000 students. The B&amp;B:00/01 included about 10,000  		students, and the B&amp;B:93/03 surveyed approximately 11,000 students. </p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The B&amp;B provides national level estimates only. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B is a longitudinal study, with follow-up varying by cohort. The  		first cohort was followed from 1993 to 2003, while the second cohort was  		followed only for one year from 2000 to 2001. Data collection is currently in  		progress for the third cohort. These students were initially interviewed in  		2008 and 2009, with an additional follow-up survey planned for 2012. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B has been conducted for three cohorts. The first cohort was  		initially surveyed as a part of the NPSAS:93, with follow-up interviews in  		1994, 1997, and 2003. The second cohort was interviewed for the NPSAS:00 and  		completed a follow-up interview in 2001. The third cohort was initially  		interviewed as a part of the NPSAS:08 and completed a first follow-up interview  		in 2009. A second follow-up survey is scheduled for 2012. Data, questionnaires,  		and codebooks are not yet available for the B&amp;B:08/12. </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Questions about disability in the B&amp;B:93/03 vary by survey year.  		Disability questions in the B&amp;B:93/94 were asked of those who reported a  		disability on the NPSAS:93, as well as those who did not, but who reported that  		their status had changed. The B&amp;B:93/97 asked all respondents if they have  		any disabilities or limitations which interfere with their ability to work. The  		B&amp;B:93/03 asked all respondents if they have a long lasting physical or  		mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities.  		If the respondent indicated a disability, limitation, or condition on the  		B&amp;B:93/94, B&amp;B:93/97, or B&amp;B:93/03, the respondent was asked if he  		or she has a speech disability or limitation; vision impairment that cannot be  		corrected with glasses or is legally blind; hearing impairment; orthopedic or  		mobility limitation; or any other limitations, disabilities, or handicaps. </p>
<p>The B&amp;B:00/01 only included a disability question at baseline  		(NPSAS:00). All respondents were asked if they have any long lasting conditions  		such as blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment; any  		conditions that substantially limit one or more basic physical activities, such  		as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying; or any other  		physical mental or emotional conditions that have lasted 6 months or more. If  		the respondent indicated an impairment, the survey collected information about  		any difficulties learning, remembering or concentrating; dressing, bathing or  		getting around the inside of the home or dormitory; getting to school to attend  		class; getting around campus; or working at a job. The survey also asked the  		respondent to indicate their main limitation and up to three other conditions.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Questions about disability in the B&amp;B:93/03 vary by survey year.  		Disability questions in the B&amp;B:93/94 were asked of those who reported a  		disability on the NPSAS:93, as well as those who did not, but who reported that  		their status had changed. The B&amp;B:93/97 asked all respondents if they have  		any disabilities or limitations which interfere with their ability to work. The  		B&amp;B:93/03 asked all respondents if they have a long lasting physical or  		mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities.  		If the respondent indicated a disability, limitation, or condition on the  		B&amp;B:93/94, B&amp;B:93/97, or B&amp;B:93/03, the respondent was asked if he  		or she has a mental illness or serious emotional disturbance; or any other  		limitations, disabilities, or handicaps. </p>
<p>The B&amp;B:00/01 only includes a disability question at baseline  		(NPSAS:00). All respondents were asked if they have had any physical, mental,  		or emotional conditions that have lasted six months or more. If the respondent  		indicated an impairment, the survey collected information about any  		difficulties learning, remembering or concentrating; dressing, bathing or  		getting around the inside of the home or dormitory; getting to school to attend  		class; getting around campus; or working at a job. The survey also asked  		respondents to indicate their main limitation and up to three other  		conditions.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Questions about disability in the B&amp;B:93/03 vary by survey year.  		Disability questions in the B&amp;B:93/94 were asked of those who reported a  		disability on the NPSAS:93, as well as those who did not, but who report that  		their status had changed. The B&amp;B:93/97 asked all respondents if they have  		any disabilities or limitations which interfere with their ability to work. The  		B&amp;B:93/03 asked all respondents if they have a long lasting physical or  		mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities.  		If the respondent indicated a disability, limitation, or condition on the  		B&amp;B:93/94, B&amp;B:93/97, or B&amp;B:93/03, the respondent was asked if he  		or she has a specific learning disability; or any other limitations,  		disabilities, or handicaps. </p>
<p>The B&amp;B:00/01 only includes a disability question at baseline  		(NPSAS:00). All respondents were asked if they have any physical mental or  		emotional conditions that have lasted 6 months or more. If the respondent  		indicated an impairment, the survey collected information about any  		difficulties learning, remembering or concentrating; dressing, bathing or  		getting around the inside of the home or dormitory; getting to school to attend  		class; getting around campus; or working at a job. The survey also asked  		respondents to indicate their main limitation and up to three other  		conditions.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>All respondents were asked about their current employment. The  		respondent could answer that they are not working due to a disability. If  		respondents indicated a disability related to work, the survey queried  		respondents about when they last worked for pay, if they are currently looking  		for work, and if they have received unemployment. The survey also provides  		information about whether respondents consider themselves to have a  		disability.<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The B&amp;B collects information about receipt of public assistance. The  		respondent is asked in separate questions about receipt of public assistance  		from Social Security, Temporary Aid to Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition  		Assistance Program, child support, disability payments, or other untaxed income  		such as welfare benefits or workers compensation. The B&amp;B:00/01 includes an  		additional question about receipt of either SSI or SSDI.</p>
<p>If the respondent indicated a disability on the NPSAS:00, the survey  		asked if they received or requested any disability-related services or  		accommodations to assist in school, including alternative exam formats or  		additional time; tutors to assist with ongoing homework; readers, classroom  		note takers, or scribers; registration assistance or priority class  		registration; sign language or oral interpreters; adaptive equipment and  		technology; course substitution or waiver; or vocational rehabilitation  		services.</p>
<p>Data, questionnaire, and codebook are not yet available for the B&amp;B  		08/12.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics on the B&amp;B include undergraduate enrollment history, student  		loans and debt, income, demographics, family background, graduate school and  		professional school enrollment, employment, career development, marital status,  		family, civic involvement, and disability status. A final section specifically  		for teachers includes questions on professional licensure, job satisfaction,  		certification, and job-related training.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B can be linked to financial aid application data from the Central  		Processing System and federal student loan amounts from National Student Loan  		Data System. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>B&amp;B can be used to investigate educational outcomes for students  		with physical, emotional, or learning disabilities. Researchers can compare  		employment rates, occupations, and starting salaries for people with and  		without disabilities. The survey data can also be used to explore predictors  		for pursuing graduate or professional degrees. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="BRFSS" id="BRFSS">BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE  		SYSTEM (BRFSS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS collects information about health risk behaviors, preventive  		health practices, specific diagnoses, and health care access. It is  		administered at the state level in order to allow states to ask the questions  		they believe to be most useful and to produce state-level estimates that are  		necessary for guiding the creation and implementation of public health policy.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS is primarily sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and  		Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC  		prepares core questions, which are asked in every state, and optional question  		modules on specific topics, from which the states select which, if any, to use.  		States may also add their own questions, which are supported by state  		funds.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS samples adults living in households with a telephone. Each  		state decides how to select its sample, though all samples must support  		estimates of this population. A disproportionate stratified sample or simple  		random sample of phone numbers is selected, and one adult (age 18 or older) is  		interviewed from each household. Most questions address only the sampled adult,  		though some optional modules request information on a randomly selected child  		in the household. Most states oversample phone numbers that are believed to  		belong to households based on the proportion of similar numbers that are known  		to be households, and many oversample some substate regions, including areas in  		which a new program has been launched, areas of particular concern, or areas  		with small populations. Currently, data are collected monthly in all 50 states,  		the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS sample size has increased over time, with large growth  		experienced in the early years of the survey when the number of states  		participating was growing. The sample size was 12,258 in 1984, 124,085 in 1996,  		and 432,607 in 2009.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS is expressly designed to produce state-level estimates. Some  		states design their samples to also provide estimates for smaller regions.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS does not follow households or individuals over time. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS has been fielded each year since 1984. Originally surveying 15  		states, it has covered all 50 states and the District of Columbia since 1996.  		The BRFSS is fielded throughout the year, and data are aggregated to produce  		yearly estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS collects information about whether respondents have any health  		problem that requires them to use special equipment such as a wheelchair or  		special phone. Optional modules collect information on diabetes; oral health;  		cardiovascular disease; asthma; falls; cancer; arthritis; and whether the  		respondent is blind or low-vision.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS includes information about the number of days on which the  		respondents mental health was not good. An optional module on anxiety and  		depression collects information on the number of days respondents had little  		interest or pleasure in doing things; felt down, depressed, or hopeless; had  		trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or slept too much; felt tired or had  		little energy; had a poor appetite or ate too much; felt bad about themselves,  		that they were a failure, or had let their family down; had trouble  		concentrating on things; moved and spoken noticeably slowly, or been restless  		and fidgety; and whether respondents had been told they have an anxiety or  		depressive disorder.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS includes information about cognitive impairment in an optional  		module. Questions address whether respondents or another member of the  		household has experienced confusion or memory loss that is getting worse or  		happening more often; those individuals ages; whether they have given up  		household activities or chores as a result; whether they require the most  		assistance with safety (for example, remembering to turn off the stove),  		transportation, household activities, or personal care; whether their confusion  		or memory loss has interfered with their ability to work, volunteer, or engage  		in social activities; how often a family member or friend has provided  		assistance; whether the confusion or memory loss has been discussed with a  		doctor; if it is being treated; and if a doctor has said that they have  		Alzheimers or another form of dementia. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS includes information on general health; healthy days; days on  		which health prevented respondents from normal activities; health insurance and  		use and source of health care; and veterans health (optional module).</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS questionnaire is comprised of core questions and optional  		modules. All states are required to administer the core questions. The optional  		modules are standardized questions that are supported by the CDC that cover  		additional health topics or are more detailed questions on a health topic that  		is included in the core. Each year, states must choose which optional modules,  		if any, they will use based on their data needs. States can also add their own  		content. The specific topics covered by the survey change somewhat from year to  		year, but address issues of health and behavioral risk factors.</p>
<p>In 2010, core questions addressed health status; healthy days and  		health-related quality of life; health care access; sleep; exercise; diabetes;  		oral health; cardiovascular disease; asthma; disability; tobacco use;  		demographic characteristics; alcohol consumption; immunization; falls; seatbelt  		use; drinking and driving; womens health; prostate cancer screening;  		colorectal cancer screening; HIV/AIDS; and emotional support and life  		satisfaction.</p>
<p>Optional modules in the 2010 survey addressed pre-diabetes; diabetes;  		healthy days and the symptoms suffered on other days; visual impairment and  		access to eye care; excess sun exposure; inadequate sleep; family planning;  		adult asthma history; arthritis; whether the respondent is a health care  		worker; shingles vaccines; tetanus and diphtheria vaccines; human papilloma  		virus; cancer survivorship; caregivers; reactions to race; anxiety and  		depression; cognitive impairment; social context; general preparedness;  		veterans health; adverse childhood experiences; basic demographic  		information on a randomly selected child in the household; childhood asthma;  		and childhood immunization.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The BRFSS is not linked to administrative data. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>BRFSS data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of public health  		policies and programs, or to identify the need for new or expanded programs and  		services. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Core questions are composed of fixed, rotating, and emerging questions.  		Fixed core questions are asked every year. Rotating core questions are asked in  		alternating years, and supported as optional questions in years they are not  		asked. Emerging questions generally address issues that have recently become of  		interest. They are included for one year, and then evaluated to determine  		whether to add them to the fixed or rotating core in future years. </p>

<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the United States Census is to generate statistics on the  		United States population that are used to determine political representation  		and government funding. </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The Census is sponsored by the Census Bureau, U.S. Department of  		Commerce.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The Census collects data on the entire United States population,  		including those who are not legally allowed to reside in the country and some  		United States citizens residing abroad. Full data are collected on up to six  		members of a household, including the person in whose name the dwelling is  		owned or rented, or another adult if they are not available. Basic information  		(gender and date of birth) is collected on up to six additional members of the  		household.</p>
<p>From 1940 to 2000, a randomly selected subset of the population (about  		17 percent in 2000) received a long form Census questionnaire,  		which requested additional information. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The sample size for the Census has increased with the United States  		population, which was estimated to be 308,745,538 in 2010.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>Census data are available at regional, state, and local levels.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The Census does not produce longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The Census has been administered every 10 years since 1790. From 1940 to  		2000, a proportion of respondents received the long form Census, which  		requested additional information. The long form was not used in 2010 because it  		was replaced by the <a href="#ACS">ACS</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Census no longer includes information on disability. In 2000, the  		long form Census included information on whether any individual was deaf,  		blind, or had a vision or hearing impairment; had a condition that limited  		basic physical activities such as climbing stairs or carrying; or, due to a  		physical, mental or emotional condition lasting more than six months, had  		difficulty bathing, dressing, or getting around the home; had difficulty going  		outside the home to shop or visit a doctors office; or had difficulty  		working. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Census no longer includes information on disability. In 2000, the  		long form Census included information on whether, due to a physical, mental, or  		emotional condition lasting more than six months, any individual had difficulty  		learning, remembering or concentrating; difficulty bathing, dressing, or  		getting around the home; difficulty going outside the home to shop or visit a  		doctors office; or difficulty working. </p>

<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Census no longer includes information on disability. In 2000, the  		long form Census included information on whether any individual received Social  		Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, SSI, other retirement payments, or  		survivor disability payments, as well as short-term illnesses that prevented  		work. </p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>In 2010, the Census covered gender, age, race, ethnicity, and  		relationship to the person who owns or rents the home. In previous years, the  		Census also collected information from a sample of the population on additional  		demographic characteristics (for example, marital history), social  		characteristics (for example, disability, education, veteran status, and  		occupation), and economic characteristics (for example, income and hours  		worked).</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The Census is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The Census can be used to describe the prevalence of disability dating  		back to 1830, or to track changes in disability patterns in small geographic  		areas, using the <a href="#ACS">ACS</a> for data after 2000.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Beginning in 2005, the <a href="#ACS">ACS</a> has fielded questions  		similar to those in the long form version of the 2000 Census. A long form was  		not used in the 2010 Census, because it has been replaced by the <a href="#ACS">ACS</a>. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="CE" id="CE">CONSUMER EXPENDITURE SURVEY (CE)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The CE collects information about household income and expenditures  		through two components: the quarterly Interview Survey and the weekly Diary  		Survey.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce administers the CE for  		the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. </p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The CE uses a sample of addresses from the most recent <a href="#Census">Census</a> and periodically updates this list to reflect new  		construction permits and newly identified housing units. The CE surveys  		consumer units,<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> which includes all related and  		nonrelated members of households, and may be answered by any member age 16 or  		older. The CE is designed to represent the total civilian noninstitutional  		population.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>Approximately 12,000 housing units are selected for the Diary Survey  		sample. Each household completes the survey over a two-week period, with field  		interviewing spread evenly throughout the year. </p>
<p>The Interview Survey uses a national sample of approximately 14,000  		housing units each quarter. Households are interviewed once a quarter for five  		quarters, or 15 months. The sample is continuously updated as new households  		are selected for interview to replace those that have completed the interview  		cycle. Twenty percent of the sample is interviewed for the first time each  		quarter. </p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The CE produces regional estimates for Northeast, Midwest, South, and  		West. Metropolitan level estimates are also available for the largest  		Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within each region.<sup><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> The CE does not produce state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The CE Interview Survey is administered to respondents once per quarter  		for five quarters. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The CE was first fielded in the late 1800s as a decennial survey.  		Since 1980, the survey has been conducted annually. The CE surveys each  		household selected for the Interview Survey once every three months over five  		quarters. The CE surveys each household selected for the Diary Survey for two  		consecutive one-week periods.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Interview Survey collects information about expenditures on medical  		services, including eye care, dental care, inpatient care, services by  		physicians and other medical professionals, and lab tests or x-rays. The survey  		also collects information about expenditures on medicine and medical supplies,  		including hearing aids, prescription drugs, medical or surgical equipment for  		general use, and supportive or convalescent equipment (canes, crutches,  		walkers, wheelchairs). It also provides information on expenditures on care for  		individuals inside the home, in a convalescent or nursing home, or at an adult  		daycare center. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Interview Survey collects information about expenditures on  		inpatient care, which includes psychiatric hospitals and substance abuse  		hospitals. The survey also collects information on expenditures on services by  		mental health professionals, including substance abuse professionals and  		psychologists. It also provides information on expenditures on care for  		individuals inside the home, in a convalescent or nursing home, or at an adult  		daycare center. </p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Interview Survey provides information on expenditures on care for  		individuals either inside the home, in a convalescent or nursing home, or at an  		adult daycare center.<sup><a href="#note7">7</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Interview Survey collects information about Medicaid, Medicare, and  		private health insurance enrollment. </p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics covered in the Interview Survey include general housing  		characteristics; major household appliances; rented and owned living quarters  		and real estate; utilities and fuels; construction, repairs, alterations, and  		maintenance of property; household item repairs and service contracts; home  		furnishings and related household items; clothing and sewing materials; rented  		and leased vehicles; owned vehicles; vehicle operating expenses; insurance  		other than health; hospitalization and health insurance; medical and health  		expenditures; educational expenses; subscriptions, memberships, books and  		entertainment expenses; trips and vacations; food and beverage expenses; credit  		liability; and work experience and income. </p>
<p>The Diary Survey records all expenses incurred within one week.  		Respondents include expenses in the following categories: food and drinks away  		from home; food and drinks for home consumption; clothing, shoes, jewelry, and  		accessories; all other products, services, and expenses.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The CE is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The CE can be used to evaluate spending on health care expenses. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The CE is currently undergoing a re-design. This re-design effort is  		referred to as the Gemini Project. The primary purpose of the Gemini Project is  		to improve the quality of CE data by reducing measurement error, particularly  		the error caused by underreporting.

</ul><h3><a name="CPS" id="CPS">CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS provides monthly data at national, state, and local levels on  		the size of the labor force,employment,unemployment, persons not in the labor  		force, hours of work,earnings, and other demographic and labor force  		characteristics. Supplements produce data on a variety of other topics,  		including income, voting, and volunteering.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS is sponsored by the Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce  		and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. Other agencies or  		organizations can add supplemental content, which is funded by the agency or  		organization.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS uses a two or three-stage probability sample of the  		noninstitutionalized civilian population aged 15 and older, including those  		living in group quarters. One person generally provides data for all eligible  		members of the household or group quarters unit (for example, bed or room). If  		a respondent is unable to respond for all members of the household or group  		quarters unit, attempts are made to contact those people directly. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>Since 2001, the CPS has used a sample of about 60,000 occupied  		households each month. The sample size has changed periodically, ranging from  		50,000 to 60,000 since 1967.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS is designed to produce estimates at state and local levels. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS does not produce longitudinal data. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS has been conducted monthly since 1940. Because the survey  		underwent significant changes in 1994, data before and after that date are not  		comparable. </p>
<p>Households are sampled for four consecutive months, then during the same  		four months one year later. While earlier surveys identify work limitations,  		six questions on disability were added to the CPS in June 2008.<sup><a href="#note8">8</a></sup> These are asked of households during their first  		month in the sample and the same month one year later. </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS includes information on whether any household member is deaf or  		has serious difficulty hearing; is blind or has serious difficulty seeing even  		when wearing glasses; serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs; or  		difficulty dressing or bathing; and whether because of a physical, mental, or  		emotional condition any individual has serious difficulty concentrating,  		remembering or making decisions; or difficulty doing errands alone such as  		visiting a doctors office or shopping.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS includes information on whether because of a physical, mental or  		emotional condition any individual has serious difficulty concentrating,  		remembering or making decisions or difficulty doing errands alone such as  		visiting a doctors office or shopping.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS includes information on whether because of a physical, mental or  		emotional condition any individual has serious difficulty concentrating,  		remembering or making decisions or difficulty doing errands alone such as  		visiting a doctors office or shopping.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS includes information on those who are not participating in the  		labor force due to a disability or temporary health condition. This is the only  		measure of disability status that was regularly collected before 2008.  		Information on the presence of veterans service-connected disabilities  		has been collected approximately every two years. </p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The core section of the CPS collects data on demographic  		characteristics, annual work activity and income, veteran status, school  		enrollment, contingent employment, worker displacement, and job tenure.  		Supplements have addressed home vacancies; health insurance and pension  		enrollment; awareness of lead paint hazards; contingent workers; food security;  		race and ethnicity; marital history; fertility; educational attainment;  		veterans; school enrollment; tobacco use; displaced workers; worker mobility  		and job tenure; child support; voting and registration; work schedule; computer  		and Internet use; participation in the arts; volunteering; and cellular phone  		use. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement provides information on family  		characteristics, household composition, marital status, education attainment,  		health insurance coverage, foreign born population, previous years income  		from all sources, work experience, receipt of noncash benefit, poverty, program  		participation, and geographic mobility.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The CPS is not routinely linked to administrative data. It has been  		linked to U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) data for specific and  		restricted use by SSA staff.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>With the additional of the six disability questions, the CPS can now  		provide information on the labor force participation and employment of people  		with disabilities over time which may be disaggregated by age, sex, race,  		marital status, industry, and occupation. It can be used to track employment  		statistics of people with disabilities over time, to compare the unemployment  		rates of people with and without disabilities, or to identify occupations with  		particularly high or low numbers of people with disabilities. The work  		limitation measure of disability can be used to track work disability over a  		longer period.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Disability data are not available at state or local levels, due to small  		sample sizes.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="ECLS" id="ECLS">EARLY CHILDHOOD LONGITUDINAL SURVEY  		(ECLS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS is composed of three longitudinal studies that examine child  		development, school readiness, and early school experiences. The original  		ECLS-K focused on children's early school experiences beginning with  		kindergarten and following children through middle school. The ECLS-B focused  		on early childhood experiences, and followed children from nine months of age  		through kindergarten entry. The 2010-2011 ECLS-K is much like the original  		ECLS-K, but follows children only through 5thgrade.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics of  		the Institute of Education Sciences, in the U.S. Department of Education in  		partnership with various other components within the U.S. Department of  		Education and agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and  		the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-K used a multistage probability sample design to select a  		representative sample of children attending kindergarten in 1998-1999. A sample  		of students who were enrolled in 1st grade in 1999-2000, but had not attended  		kindergarten the previous year were added beginning in spring 2000. At each  		interview, only a subsample of those who had moved schools was followed. </p>
<p>The sample for ECLS-B was selected from listings of registered births in  		the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) vital statistics system. Asian  		and Pacific Islander children, American Indian and Alaska Native children,  		Chinese children, twins, and low and very low birth weight children were  		oversampled. Sampled children who died or were adopted were excluded from the  		sample, as were those whose birth mothers were younger than 15 years at the  		time of the childs birth.</p>
<p>Survey data are collected from parents, childcare providers, and  		teachers. Children provide some survey data in the 5th and 8th grade interviews  		of the ECLS-K.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-B used a sample of 14,000 children. The original ECLS-K started  		with a sample of 21,387 in 1998 and had a sample size of 12,129 in spring  		2007.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS surveys do not support regional or state-level estimates. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS surveys follow children for various periods of time, depending  		on the sample (see next section). </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS is composed of three surveys. The ECLS-B collected information  		on children born in 2001 when the children were nine months old (2001-2002),  		two years old (2003-2004), four years old (2005-2006), and in fall 2006.  		Interviews were conducted in fall 2007 for those who were not yet in  		kindergarten in 2006, or were repeating it in 2007. </p>
<p>The ECLS-K collected information on students who were in kindergarten in  		1998-1999. Surveys were administered in the fall and spring of kindergarten  		(1998-1999), the fall and spring of 1st grade (1999-2000), the spring of 3rd  		grade (2002), the spring of 5thgrade (2004), and the spring of 8th grade  		(2007).</p>
<p>The ECLS-K:2011 will follow students in kindergarten in 2010-2011  		through 5th grade. Data was collected in the fall and spring of kindergarten  		(2010-2011), and will be collected in the fall and spring of 1st grade  		(2011-2012), the spring of 2nd grade (2013), the spring of 3rd grade (2014),  		the spring of 4thgrade (2015), and the spring of 5th grade (2016). </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-K asks how children compare to others of the same age in their  		coordination using limbs, and their ability to pronounce words and communicate  		with and understand others. The ECLS-K asks if children have a hearing problem,  		and if so how severe it is; if they use a hearing aid or have cochlear  		implants; and to what extent that improves their ability to hear and understand  		conversations. The survey asks whether children have problems seeing letters on  		paper or objects in the distance; and if so if it is correctable with glasses,  		and what they can see.</p>
<p>The ECLS-B asks if children have been evaluated by a professional in  		response to their use of limbs; ability to communicate; hearing; or vision, and  		in each case if this resulted in a diagnosis. If a child has been diagnosed  		with a hearing problem the ECLS-B collects information on whether the child is  		deaf in one or both ears. If children have an eyesight problem the survey asks  		if their eyesight is correctable with glasses, and if they wear glasses. The  		survey also asks if children use a hearing aid, have an impairment or health  		problem that requires the use of special equipment; and if they have a problem  		with stuttering and if so when it began and ended. </p>
<p>Both the ECLS-B and ECLS-K ask if children received speech or language  		therapy; occupational therapy; physical therapy; vision services; hearing or  		audio logical services; social work services; psychological services; home  		visits; parent support or training; special classes; private tutoring;  		instruction in brail (if a child has a sight problem); or in lip reading or  		American Sign Language, (if a child has a hearing problem); and in all how many  		hours of services and where services are received.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-K asks students in the 8th grade if they feel good about  		themselves; have enough control over the direction their life is taking; feel  		good luck is more important than hard work; feel they are a person of worth,  		the equal of other people; feel useless at times; are satisfied with themselves  		on the whole; or feel they do not have much to be proud of, and who they go to  		when they need to be cheered up. </p>
<p>The ECLS-K asks parents if they have ever had concerns about how their  		children behave and relate with others; their emotional behavior; or their  		weight or an eating disorder; and in each case if they have been evaluated by a  		professional for the problem, if they were diagnosed, and if so what the  		diagnosis was and when the diagnosis occurred. </p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-K asks how children compare with others of the same age in  		being independent and taking care of themselves; paying attention; thinking,  		learning and solving problems; and if they lag in any of these whether they  		have been evaluated, if they were diagnosed, and what the primary diagnosis was  		(learning disability, ADD, developmental delay, dyslexia, mental retardation)  		and when the condition was diagnosed. Respondents are asked how a childs  		overall activity level compares to that of other children of the same age, if  		they have concerns about it, if the child has been evaluated, if they were  		diagnosed, what the diagnosis was (learning disability, ADD, developmental  		delay, dyslexia, mental retardation), and when the child was diagnosed.</p>
<p>The ECLS-B asks if children have been evaluated by a professional in  		response to their ability to pay attention or learn; or overall activity level,  		and in each case if this resulted in a diagnosis. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-K asks parents about the general quality of their  		childrens health. It also asks if their children have been to the  		emergency room; admitted overnight to the hospital; received therapy services  		and if so from whom and for what reason; and if their children are covered by  		insurance and the source. </p>
<p>The ECLS-K asks special education teachers about students primary  		disabling conditions; for what conditions they received special education  		services; when they began receiving services; what services were provided to  		students at school (audiology, counseling service, occupational therapy,  		physical therapy, psychological services, school health services, social work  		services, special transportation, and speech or language therapy) and if  		students received adaptive physical education, classroom aides, instruction in  		Braille, an interpreter if deaf or hard of hearing, instruction in American  		Sign Language, instruction in Manual English, or instruction in Cued Speech.  		The survey also asks the teacher whether students used assistive technology,  		and if so, what type. </p>
<p>The ECLS-B collects information on the general quality of the  		childs health. It asks if the child has been to a doctor for well-child  		visits; been to a dentist; is taking prescription medicine and if so why; has  		been admitted overnight to the hospital; has been to the emergency room; and if  		the child is covered by health insurance and what kind. If children are  		repeating kindergarten the survey asks for the reason they are repeating. The  		survey also asks if the child receives special education services related to an  		individualized education program or individualized family service plan, and if  		so where and for how much time each week. Respondents are asked if they have  		been told that the child has a problem with mobility; another development  		delay; epilepsy or seizures; a heart defect; mental retardation; autism or  		pervasive developmental disorder; oppositional defiant disorder; attention  		deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); diabetes; anemia; a blood disease;  		allergies; a skin condition; or another chronic medical problem. </p>
<p>Both the ECLS-K and the ECLS-B ask if the child was born three or more  		weeks early, born with low birth weight, or was part of a multiple birth. </p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS-K and ECLS-B collect information on family structure; school  		experiences; child development, literacy, and school readiness; home  		environment; parenting behavior and attitudes; childcare arrangements; child  		health; family health; marriages and partner relationships; spouse and partner  		information, welfare and other public assistance; household income and assets;  		neighborhood quality and safety; and household food sufficiency. </p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>ECLS data are linked to information from the childs school.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The ECLS surveys can be used to track the special education services  		used by children with disabilities; to estimate differences in academic  		achievement of children with certain disabilities versus that of children with  		other disabilities or without disabilities; and to compare the health concerns,  		diagnoses, and services used between the original ECLS-K cohort and the  		2010-2011 ECLS-K cohort.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>In addition to surveys, the ECLS administers age-appropriate tests to  		children in order to measure their cognitive development. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="HRS" id="HRS">HEALTH AND RETIREMENT STUDY (HRS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS is a large-scale longitudinal project that studies the labor  		force participation and health transitions that individuals undergo toward the  		end of their work lives and in the years that follow. Since its launch in 1992,  		the study has collected information about income, work, assets, pension plans,  		health insurance, disability, physical health and functioning, cognitive  		functioning, and health care expenditures. Through its interviews with a  		nationally representative sample of adults over age 50, the HRS provides a wide  		range of data intended to help researchers address the challenges and  		opportunities of aging.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, U.S. Department  		of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Social Security Administration, and  		administered by the University of Michigan. </p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS is comprised of six samples: the original HRS cohort (born  		1931-1941), the Aging and Health Dynamics cohort (AHEAD, born before 1923), the  		Children of the Depression cohort (COD, born 1923-1930), the War Baby cohort  		(WB, born 1942-1947), the Early Boomers cohort (EB, born 1948-1953), and the  		Mid-Boomers cohort (MB, born 1954-1959). </p>
<p>The original HRS, WB, EB, and MB groups are multistage probability  		samples of the target birth cohort residing in households. Those living in  		institutional settings or other group quarters were not sampled, but sample  		members who moved into those settings were followed. African Americans,  		Hispanics, and Floridians were oversampled to allow for subgroup analyses. The  		COD group was drawn from Medicare enrollment data. The AHEAD sample was drawn  		from both the household and Medicare data. </p>
<p>In all cases, one eligible sample member was selected as the primary  		respondent from each sampled household. Their spouse, as well as any spouse  		they may have in the future, is interviewed. As samples were added to the  		original HRS sample, individuals who were age-ineligible spouses of a member of  		an earlier sample, and thus already part of the study, continued to complete  		interviews, but were now considered eligible members of their own birth cohort,  		rather than ineligible members of another. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS uses a sample of slightly more than 22,000 individuals across  		all cohorts. In 2004, 9,759 interviews were conducted for the original HRS  		sample, 4,438 for the AHEAD sample, 1,970 for the COD sample, 2,324 for the WB  		sample, and 3,340 for the EB sample.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS supports estimates at the state level.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS follows respondents and their spouses over time until they die  		or are lost to follow-up. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS was first fielded in 1992 using the original HRS cohort, and has  		been administered every two years. The AHEAD cohort began as part of a  		different study in 1993, was fielded again in 1995, and joined the HRS in 1998.  		The COD and WB cohorts were added in 1998, the EB cohort in 2004, and the MB  		cohort in 2010. These additional cohorts have been interviewed every two years,  		at the same time as the original HRS cohort. </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS collects information on whether, before age 16, respondents had  		difficulty seeing even with glasses or prescription lenses; a speech  		impairment; were disabled for six months or more (unable to do the usual  		activities of classmates or other children of the same age), and if so the  		cause of that disability; or if they had problems in learning the usual lessons  		in school. If so, respondents are asked when the problem was diagnosed and how  		long it lasted. Respondents also are asked whether they use a hearing aid.</p>
<p>The HRS collects information on whether respondents experience  		difficulty with the following activities due to a health condition that is  		expected to last three months or longer: walking one or a few blocks; running  		or jogging a mile; sitting for two hours; getting up from a chair after  		sitting; climbing one or several flights of stairs without resting; kneeling,  		stooping, or crouching; extending arms above shoulder level; pushing or pulling  		large objects; carrying weights over 10 pounds; and picking up a dime from a  		table. Respondents also are asked whether, because of a health or memory  		problem, they experience difficulty dressing; walking across a room, and if so  		if they use assistive equipment; bathing; eating; getting in and out of bed,  		and if so if they use assistive equipment; using the toilet; preparing hot  		meals; shopping for groceries; making phone calls; taking medications; managing  		money; and in each case if so if they ever receive help. If respondents receive  		help in any of these activities they are asked who helps, if they are paid, how  		much they are paid, and by whom. Respondents also are asked for their height  		and weight.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS collects information on whether, before age 16, respondents had  		depression; drug or alcohol problems; other emotional or psychological  		problems; were disabled for six months or more (unable to do the usual  		activities of classmates or other children of the same age), and if so the  		cause of that disability; or if they had problems in learning the usual lessons  		in school. If so, respondents are asked when the problem was diagnosed and how  		long it lasted. </p>
<p>The HRS collects information on whether there has been a period in the  		past 12 months during which respondents felt sad, blue, or depressed, or lost  		interest in most things for two weeks or more, and if so how long each day the  		feeling lasted, whether they felt low in energy; lost their appetite; had their  		appetite increase; had trouble falling asleep; had more difficulty  		concentrating than usual; felt down on their self, no good, or worthless; or  		thought a lot about death. </p>
<p>The HRS asks whether respondents take prescription medicine for anxiety  		or depression.</p>
<p>Respondents are asked whether much of the time in the past week they  		felt depressed; felt that everything they did was an effort; were happy; felt  		lonely; enjoyed life; felt sad; could not get going; had a lot of energy; and  		whether their sleep was restless. </p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS collects information on whether, before age 16, the respondent  		was disabled for six months or more (unable to do the usual activities of  		classmates or other children of the same age), and if so the cause of that  		disability; or if they had problems in learning the usual lessons in school. If  		so, the respondent is asked when the problem was diagnosed and how long it  		lasted. </p>
<p>Respondents also are asked whether, because of a health or memory  		problem, they experience difficulty dressing; walking across a room, and if so  		if they use assistive equipment; bathing; eating; getting in and out of bed,  		and if so if they use assistive equipment; using the toilet; preparing hot  		meals; shopping for groceries; making phone calls; taking medications; managing  		money; and in each case if so if they ever receive help. If respondents receive  		help in any of these activities they are asked who helps, if they are paid, how  		much they are paid, and by whom. The HRS also asks whether due to a health or  		memory problem respondents have difficulty using a map to figure out how to get  		around in a strange place.</p>
<p>The HRS administers tests of word recall, arithmetic, basic facts, and  		word definitions to gauge a respondents cognitive health. A proxy is  		asked about the general quality and changes in specific elements of the sample  		members memory, including remembering birthdays, where things are usually  		kept, conversations that happed several days before, and the date, as well as  		handling financial matters, learning new things, and reasoning through  		questions or problems. The proxy also is asked whether the sample member ever  		gets lost in a familiar environment; ever wanders off and does not return on  		his or her own; can be left alone; or sees or hears things that are not  		there.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS collects information on the respondents health before age  		6; general health; information on specific conditions (high blood pressure,  		diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke, emotional,  		nervous, or psychiatric problems, memory problems, arthritis, shingles, falls  		and injuries, cataracts and glaucoma), including when the condition was  		diagnosed, symptoms experienced, how it is treated, and whether it restricts  		the respondents activities in any way; physical activity; days on which  		the respondent stayed in bed half the day or more due to illness or injury;  		health insurance coverage; health insurance premiums and co-payments; and what  		services are covered by health insurance.</p>
<p>The HRS asks whether respondents who have served in the military have a  		disability related to their service. </p>
<p>Respondents are asked whether they have an impairment or health problem  		that limits the kind or amount of paid work they can do, and if so what causes  		it; if it is a temporary condition; and if they have had the condition before.  		They also are asked if any impairment or health problem limits the kind or  		amount of work they can do around the house, if not they are asked if they are  		limited in any way in activities because of an impairment or health problem,  		and if so, when the problem first bothered them. Respondents are asked if they  		are able to work full-time or part-time; regularly or occasionally; if they are  		able to do the same kind of work as before the limitation began; when the  		problem began to limit work if that has occurred; when it prevented them from  		working entirely if that has occurred; if the condition is expected to improve  		or get worse; if it is the result of an accident or injury, and if so where it  		occurred; if it is related to their work; if respondents were employed when it  		began to limit their ability to work; and whether the impairment began to  		affect their ability to work before or after they started to work regularly. If  		respondents were employed or had been employed since, they are asked if each  		employer provided accommodations (got someone to help, shortened the work day,  		more breaks and rests, arranged for special transportation, changed the job,  		helped them learn new job skills, received special equipment, or assisted in  		receiving rehabilitative services from an outside provider). Respondents also  		are asked how their work has changed, and if they have used any savings since  		their health began to limit their ability to work. </p>
<p>The survey also asks about receipt of an application for SSDI, SSI,  		veterans benefits, and workers compensation.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS collects information on demographic characteristics; health  		status; health care utilization; health care costs; functional limitations,  		activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living  		(IADLs), and helpers; cognition; expectations; family structure; transfers;  		housing; assets and debts; income; capital gains; employment, retirement, and  		pensions; retirement plans; disability; health and life insurance; widowhood;  		divorce; Internet use; and physical measures and biomarkers. </p>
<p>Questionnaires on other topics are administered to members of the HRS  		sample in odd years. These have included human capital and educational expenses  		in 2001; individual activities and household expenses in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007  		and 2009; diabetes in 2003; prescription drug use in 2005 and 2007 to track  		changes around the implementation of Medicare Part D; and questions that asked  		respondents to classify the limitations faced by people presented in several  		vignettes. </p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS is linked periodically with mortality information from the  		National Death Index (NDI), and also has been linked to Social Security benefit  		records and Medicare records. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The HRS can be used to compare the financial well-being of those who  		experience disability onset with those who do not; to track changes in  		activities as respondents age and generally experience more limitations; and to  		estimate the prevalence of limitations among the population over age 50. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="HSLS" id="HSLS">HIGH SCHOOL LONGITUDINAL STUDY  		(HSLS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the HSLS is to understand students trajectories  		from the beginning of high school into postsecondary education, the workforce,  		and beyond; what students decide to pursue when, why, and how, especially in  		regards to science, technology, engineering, and math courses, majors, and  		careers; and students algebraic skills, reasoning, and problem solving.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS is sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S.  		Department of Education.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS uses a sample of about 25-30 9th graders randomly selected from  		each of 844 nationally representative high schools, including both public and  		private schools. Separate surveys are administered to students parents,  		math and science teachers, school administrators, and lead school  		counselors.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS uses a sample of about 21,000 individuals.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS is representative of individuals at the state level in  		California, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  		Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS follows individuals for 12 years, from 9thgrade to  		approximately age 26.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS has been fielded since 2009, when the first Wave of data  		collection began. The next Wave will begin in the spring of 2012. A Wave of  		data collection is planned for the spring of 2013 to record students  		postsecondary options and plans. Subsequent data collections are planned for  		2017 to learn about students postsecondary experiences, and in 2021 to  		learn about participants choices, decisions, attainment, and experiences  		in adulthood.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Parents are asked if they have ever been told by a doctor, health care  		provider, teacher, or school official that their 9th graders have hearing  		problems or vision problems that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact  		lenses; or bone, joint, or muscle problems.</p>
<p>Questions ask parents how much difficulty their 9thgraders experience  		with speaking, communicating, or being understood compared with other 9th  		graders.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS asks parents how much difficulty their 9thgraders experience  		with feeling anxious or depressed; behavior problems; or making and keeping  		friends compared with other 9th graders.</p>
<p>Questions ask parents how many times during the last school year they or  		another family member were contacted by the school because of problem behavior  		of their 9th graders.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS asks if parents have ever been told by a doctor, health care  		provider, teacher, or school official that their 9th graders have a specific  		learning disability; any developmental delay that affects the ability to learn;  		autism, Aspergers disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, or another  		autism spectrum disorder; an intellectual disability or mental retardation; ADD  		or ADHD; and if they are taking medication for ADD or ADHD.</p>
<p>Questions ask parents how much difficulty their 9thgraders experience  		learning, understanding, or paying attention compared with other 9th  		graders.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS asks parents if their 9th graders currently receive special  		educational services.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Questions solicit information from students about their ethnic  		background and age; previous educational experiences; educational experiences  		at home and school; plans for postsecondary education; and plans after high  		school. The parent component asks about students family structure; family  		origin and language; parents education and occupation; students  		previous educational experiences; parents involvement; and parents  		opinions of their childrens future plans. The math and science teacher  		component collects information about teachers backgrounds; science and  		math instruction; and teachers beliefs about teaching and their current  		schools. School administrators are asked about school characteristics including  		student population; teachers; courses offered; and administrators  		background and goals. The lead school counselor component asks about school  		staffing and practices; school programs and policies; math and science  		placement; and counselors opinions of schools counseling  		programs</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS is not linked to administrative data. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The HSLS is useful for determining how disability affects students  		educational achievement and realization of future plans. It also can provide  		information about how schools might better accommodate students with  		disabilities. By including student, parent, teacher, counselor, and  		administrator components, the HSLS allows consideration of various perspectives  		on school improvement.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Disability-related questions were asked in the previous educational  		experiences section of the survey. Information about future questionnaires and  		disability questions is not yet available.</p>
<p>The HSLS continues to follow students who do not continue high school  		after selection for the sample. Students parents, teachers, school  		counselors, and administrators are not required to complete surveys, so these  		components may not be available for each student.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="LSOA" id="LSOA">LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF AGING  		(LSOA)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The LSOA assesses physical health, health care usage, and living  		arrangements of seniors. The survey followed two cohorts of older Americans and  		can be used to evaluate the effects of aging over time. </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The LSOA is sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics and  		the National Institute on Aging, both within the U.S. Department of Health and  		Human Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The LSOA is a nationally representative household survey of  		noninstitutionalized civilians based on the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> sample. If  		a respondent is unable to complete the survey due to incapacitation or death,  		the survey collects information from family members or proxy respondents. </p>
<p>All respondents age 55 and older living in a household selected for the  		1984 or 1994 <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> were eligible to complete the Supplement  		on Aging (SOA). The SOA acts as the baseline component for the LSOA. The LSOA  		selected a subsample of SOA participants age 70 and older and oversampled the  		oldest, minorities, and their family members.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The LSOA has been fielded twice, once starting in 1984, and again in  		1994, with sample sizes of 7,527 and 9,447, respectively.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The LSOA provides national level estimates. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Each round of the LSOA followed participants for six years. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The LSOA has been fielded twice; the earlier data are referred to as the  		LSOA and the more recent collection as the LSOA II. The baseline fielding  		occurred in 1984 as a component of the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>. Three  		subsequent follow-ups occurred in 1986, 1988, and 1990. The second Wave  		baseline fielding occurred in 1994 as a component of the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> with two subsequent follow-ups in 1997-1998 and  		1999-2000. </p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The survey collects information on weight, height, physical exercise,  		smoking, and alcohol consumption.<sup><a href="#note9">9</a></sup> All  		respondent are asked to provide information about any medical conditions and  		diagnoses at baseline on the SOA and SOA II. </p>
<p>The LSOA collects more detailed health and disability measures than is  		covered in the SOA. The LSOA queries respondents about difficulties bathing or  		showering, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking,  		getting outside, using the toilet, preparing meals, shopping for personal  		items, managing money, using the telephone, doing heavy housework, doing light  		housework, driving,<sup><a href="#note10">10</a></sup> or using public  		transportation<sup><a href="#note11">11</a></sup> due to a health or physical  		problem. If respondents indicate one or more limitations, the survey queries  		about the degree of difficulty, any changes in difficulties since the previous  		interview, use of special equipment, and any help received from either family  		members or nonrelatives. In addition, the LSOA II contains a detailed section  		on usage of personal assistive devices and technologies, including catheters,  		hearing aids, crutches canes, wheelchairs, and glucose monitors. </p>
<p>The LSOA contains detailed questions about where respondents spend most  		of the day (in a bed or in a chair); vision; and physical ability, including  		difficulties walking long or short distances, stooping, kneeling, reaching, and  		lifting. If respondents indicate a limitation, the survey queries the specific  		medical conditions that cause any limitations.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The survey does not collect data on mental health and disability  		measures. </p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SOA provides information about any instances of memory loss or  		confusion and any changes experienced in these functions over the past year.  		The LSOA II contains sections on cognitive functioning. The survey asks  		respondents to rate memory from excellent to poor and to recall basic facts,  		including the current date, counting backwards from 20 and basic factual  		questions.<sup><a href="#note12">12</a></sup> Respondents also are asked to  		complete a word recall section. If a proxy responds to the interview on behalf  		of a respondent, the proxy is asked to rate the respondents memory,  		report any changes in memory, and answer questions about instances of wondering  		off, getting lost, or seeing or hearing things that are not there. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Respondents are asked to rate their general physical health status and  		how it compares to the previous year and the health of peers. The LSOA queries  		the respondent in separate questions about income from disability payments,  		SSI, public assistance or welfare, and food stamps. </p>
<p>Service usage during the past year, including hospitalizations, nursing  		home use, use of prescriptions, doctor visits, and paid or unpaid help with  		ADLs are included in the survey. Respondents also specify if care was paid for  		by oneself or family, Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance. The LSOA  		economic supplement asks about services provided in retirement communities  		including group meals, maid or cleaning services, laundry, transportation,  		recreation, nursing or help with medication. The SOA includes information about  		use of community services, including senior centers, special transportation,  		meal delivery services (such as Meals on Wheels), visiting nurse service, home  		health aides, or adult daycare. </p>
<p>LSOA contains information on the current living arrangement of the  		respondent (house apartment, hospital, nursing home, institution, retirement  		community). If a change from the previous interview is indicated, the  		respondent can detail when the move occurred and if the move was due to among  		other reasons health status, financial status, change in the people or  		availability of people who help, downsizing, or home accessibility. The survey  		also includes questions about household accessibility, including if one or more  		steps must be used to access the house from the outside; the number of floors;  		if the bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen are all on the same floor; and if the  		housing unit has a walk-in shower. The SOA II contains information about  		special features or assistive devices for the home, including elevators, chair  		lifts, or widened doorways. </p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics in the LSOA include changes in living arrangements, instances of  		institutionalization, occupation, physical limitations, ADLs, difficulties with  		physical movements, nursing home stays, hospitalizations, and health care  		utilization. The last interview in the series includes a supplemental section  		with detailed questions on economic status, income, and expenses. The LSOA II  		includes additional sections on family structure, relationships, social  		activity, health opinions, behaviors and nutrition, cognitive function, income,  		and childhood health and family longevity. </p>
<p>Baseline data from the SOA cover family structure, relationships,  		support, and living arrangements; community and social support; occupation and  		retirement; conditions and impairments; ADLs; nursing home stays, help with  		care, and hospice; health opinions; and conditions. The SOA II also includes  		sections on transportation and assistive devices and technologies. </p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>LSOA is linked to Medicare, SSA, and NDI data. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The survey can be used to evaluate how physical limitations progress  		over time, to model future medical service usage as Americans age, and to  		assess the housing needs of older Americans. Researchers can use the economic  		supplement section to explore the financial situation of older Americans, and  		how it changes as they age. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="MEPS" id="MEPS">MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEY  		(MEPS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the MEPS is to provide information on health care use and  		spending, insurance coverage, and accessibility of health care in the United  		States. The MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans  		use including frequency of use, cost, and payment, as well as data on the cost,  		scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to those living in  		the United States through employers. </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS is sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,  		U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS has three major components: a household component; an insurance  		component; and a medical provider component. The MEPS household component is a  		nationally representative survey of the United States civilian  		noninstitutionalized population age 90 years and younger, including those  		living in group quarters. The sampling frame is drawn from respondents to the  		<a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>. The insurance component collects data from an  		independent sample of private and public sector employers on the health  		insurance plans they offer their employees. The medical provider component  		covers a sample of hospitals, physicians, home health care providers, and  		pharmacies drawn from those identified by MEPS household component respondents  		who gave permission for their providers to be contacted. In 1996 only, MEPS  		included a nursing home component that collected information from a sample of  		nursing homes and residents.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The household component of the MEPS uses a sample of about 30,000  		individuals each year; the insurance component uses a sample of about 40,000  		private sector employers and 3,000 government employers each year; and the  		medical provider component uses a sample of about 25,000-40,000 providers each  		year.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The household and medical provider components of the MEPS are not  		representative at the state or regional levels. Data are available by  		individual states and regions for the insurance component of the MEPS.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The household component of the MEPS follows individuals for two-year  		periods.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS has been fielded since 1996. The MEPS household component uses  		an overlapping panel design. A new panel of sample households is selected each  		year, and data for each panel are collected for two calendar years in five  		rounds of interviews.</p>
<p>The insurance component selects a sample of employers each year  		independently of the household component sample and does not follow employers  		longitudinally.</p>
<p>The medical provider component sample for each year is fielded in two or  		more waves. The first Wave begins while household interviewing for the data  		year is still in progress. A first Wave of the medical provider component  		sample is drawn from the first two rounds of household data collection for the  		calendar year. The final Wave of the medical provider component sample is  		fielded after the household rounds that close out the calendar year data  		collection are completed.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS household component includes information about disability days  		taken as a result of a physical illness or injury, or a mental or emotional  		problem. Questions specify how many days of work or school were missed, for  		what health condition they were missed, and how many days were missed because  		of someone else's illness, injury, or health care needs. It also identifies the  		specific physical health conditions, accidents, or injuries affecting each  		person that caused them to take disability days. </p>
<p>The MEPS solicits additional information about each physical health  		condition that caused medical events or disability days, including if it was  		due to an accident or injury and whether it is on a priority list of  		conditions. If either is the case the survey asks whether a medical provider  		has been consulted about the condition, when the condition was first noticed,  		the severity of the condition, the current status of the condition, and any  		treatments received.</p>
<p>The MEPS includes information on whether anyone in a household receives  		personal assistance or supervision or uses aids for personal care, including  		bathing, dressing, or getting around the house, or daily activities, including  		using the telephone, paying bills, taking medications, preparing light meals,  		doing laundry, or going shopping; has difficulties with walking, climbing  		stairs, grasping objects, reaching overhead, lifting, bending or stooping, or  		standing for long periods of time, which of these activities they have  		difficulty performing, and how much difficulty the individual has (no  		difficulty, some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, or completely unable to do  		it); is limited in any way in the ability to work at a job, do housework, or go  		to school; or is limited in participating in social, recreational, or family  		activities. If respondents answer that they have one of these difficulties or  		limitations they are asked if this is due to a physical or mental health  		problem, but are not asked to specify if the problem is mental or physical.</p>
<p>The MEPS solicits information about the use of glasses or contacts; if  		an individual has difficulty seeing with the use of glasses or contacts; and if  		anyone in a household is blind. It includes information on whether anyone in a  		family wears a hearing aid; if an individual has difficulty hearing with the  		use of a hearing aid; if the person is deaf; and whether the individual can  		hear some or most of the things people say with the use of the hearing aid. The  		MEPS also solicits information about expenditures on assistive equipment  		generally, and on vision and hearing aids specifically.</p>
<p>The MEPS includes information about height and weight. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS contains information about disability days taken as a result of  		physical illness, injury, or mental illness or emotional problems including how  		many days of work or school were missed; how many days were missed because of  		someone else's illness, injury, or health care needs; and the specific mental  		health conditions, accidents, or injuries affecting each person that caused  		them to take disability days. </p>
<p>The MEPS solicits additional information about each mental health  		condition identified through medical events or disability days, including  		whether it was due to an accident or injury, on a priority list of conditions,  		and if so whether a medical person has been consulted about the condition, when  		the condition was first noticed, the condition's severity, the current status  		of the condition, and any treatments received.</p>
<p>The MEPS includes information about whether anyone in a household  		receives personal assistance or uses aids for personal care or daily  		activities; is limited in any way in the ability to work at a job, do  		housework, or go to school; or is limited in participating in social,  		recreational, or family activities. If respondents answer that they have one of  		these difficulties or limitations they are asked if this is due to a physical  		or mental health problem, but are not asked to specify if the problem is mental  		or physical.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS asks if anyone in a household experiences confusion or memory  		loss that interferes with daily activities or has problems making decisions to  		the point that it interferes with daily activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS solicits information about specific health conditions that  		caused the respondent to spend the day in bed for those reporting having spent  		more than a half day in bed. </p>
<p>The MEPS provider component includes information about services or drugs  		provided during visits to hospitals or by office-based providers, home care  		health care providers, home care nonhealth care providers, institutional  		facilities, pharmacies, and separately billing doctors; the costs of the  		services; who paid for the services; and how much each party paid for the  		services. </p>
<p>Starting with the 2000 panel, respondents are asked about priority  		conditions including diabetes, asthma, hypertension, coronary heart disease,  		angina, heart attacks, other heart disorders, strokes, emphysema, joint pain,  		and arthritis.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Questions solicit information about access to health care;  		childrens health; childrens insurance coverage; disability;  		services provided by doctors; elderly health care; employment status; health  		care disparities; health insurance; health status; home health care; injuries;  		jobs; medical conditions; Medicare, Medicaid, and childrens health  		insurance program coverage; mens health; mental health; minority health;  		obesity; pharmacies; prescription drugs; preventive care; arthritis; asthma;  		diabetes; emphysema and bronchitis; general priority conditions; heart  		conditions; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; strokes; state and metro  		area estimates; quality of health care; the uninsured; usual source of care;  		and vision impairment.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>In May 2011, MEPS data from 1996 through 2009 will be linked to person  		records on <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> files. Because the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>  		is linked with SSA, Medicare, and NDI data, and soon will be linked to Medicaid  		data, the MEPS also will be linked with these sources.</p>
<p>MEPS data from some panels are linked at the county level with  		information obtained from the Area Resource File on health facilities, health  		professions, and measures of resource scarcity, health status, economic  		activity, health training programs, and socioeconomic and environmental  		characteristics.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The MEPS allows national and regional estimates of the impact of changes  		in financing, coverage, and reimbursement policy as well as estimates of who  		benefits and who bears the cost of a change in policy. It provides a foundation  		for estimating the impact of changes on different economic groups or special  		populations of interest, such as the poor, the elderly, the uninsured, and  		veterans.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The survey instrument is updated each calendar year, and data released  		on full-year files are based on the questions being asked during that year  		regardless of panel. Examples of changes include the addition of body mass  		index information beginning with the 2002 survey; the inclusion of nursing home  		residents in 1996; the addition of information about diseases, like asthma,  		heart disease, and diabetes beginning with the 2000 panel; and the  		discontinuation of selected questions about the use of assistive equipment  		beginning with the 1999 survey.</p>
<p>From 1996 to 2001, the MEPS insurance component sampled employers that  		were identified in the household component by respondents as their main  		employer or secondary employer that was the source of their health  		insurance.</p>

<p>The MCBS collects information about health status, service use, and  		health care expenditures for persons covered by Medicare. </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS is sponsored by Office of Strategic Planning of the Centers for  		Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS uses a nationally representative sample of Medicare  		beneficiaries. The MCBS selects respondents from the Medicare enrollment file  		and is updated annually to include newly enrolled persons and exclude those who  		leave the program. If a beneficiary selected for the survey is unable to  		participate in the interview, a proxy respondent may be designated.</p>
<p>The survey oversamples people with disabilities under age 64 and people  		age 80 and older. The MCBS is representative for both the Medicare population  		in general, as well as for Medicare beneficiaries in the following age groups:  		under 45, 45-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85 and over. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS surveys approximately 16,000 beneficiaries annually residing in  		households or group facilities. </p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS provides national level estimates only. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The survey collects information on weight, height, and smoking. All  		respondents are asked to specify active conditions and diagnoses as they relate  		to activity limitations, cognition, behavior, medical treatments, or risk of  		death. If conditions are specified, the survey asks if any of these conditions  		were the original cause of Medicare eligibility. The MCBS also collects  		information about the use of any medical devices, supplies or equipment  		associated with any conditions or limitations.</p>
<p>The MCBS queries the respondent about any difficulties transferring in  		and out of bed or chairs, walking, dressing, eating, using the toilet, or  		bathing. If respondents indicate one or more limitations, the survey collects  		information about the degree of difficulty, how long they have had the  		limitation, if they expect to have the limitation three months from now, use of  		special equipment, and any help the respondent receives from others.</p>
<p>The survey collects information about any difficulties stooping,  		crouching or kneeling; lifting or carrying objects as heavy as 10 pounds;  		reaching or extending arms above shoulder level; writing or handling and  		grasping small objects; walking a quarter of a mile; using the telephone, light  		or heavy house work; preparing meals; shopping for personal items; or managing  		money. If respondents indicate one or more limitations, the survey collects  		information about the degree of difficulty and whether they are able to perform  		the activity without assistance. </p>
<p>In addition, the survey collects information on hearing ability, vision  		ability, continence, ability to eat solid foods, and ability to be understood  		by others. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>

<p>The survey asks respondents to specify if they have experienced any  		cognitive difficulties that disrupt daily life, including memory loss,  		inability to concentrate, or inability to make decisions.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Respondents are asked to rate their general physical health status and  		how it compares to the previous year and the health of peers. The MCBS collects  		information about income from SSI and SSDI (single question), other disability  		payments, or any other public assistance such as Temporary Aid to Needy  		Families or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. If respondents have a  		disability related to military service, they are asked to specify their VA  		disability rating. </p>
<p>The MCBS collects information about enrollment in discount membership  		plans; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit; private health insurance to  		supplement Medicare; private prescription drug plans; or publically provided  		health care coverage including Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare advantage plan,  		TRICARE or CHAMPVA, or another public assistance health insurance program. If a  		respondent indicates enrollment in any health plan, the survey asks about  		coverage of services and medical expenses. </p>
<p>If a respondent lives a housing unit, the survey asks questions about  		household accessibility, including the number of floors; if the bathroom,  		bedroom, and kitchen are all on the same floor; if a bathroom is on each level;  		if one or more steps must be used to access the house from the outside; and if  		the housing unit has a walk-in shower.

<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS can be linked to both Medicare claims data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS can be used to evaluate health care service usage and  		expenditures for people with and without disabilities. Researchers can evaluate  		to what extent current Medicare beneficiaries are covered, both in terms of  		out-of-pocket costs and service coverage. The information in the survey can be  		used to model the impact of changes in Medicare policy on coverage for people  		with disabilities. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The MCBS includes supplement sections. In 2008, supplemental sections on  		income and assets, drug coverage, and knowledge about Medicare were included.  		</p>
<p>The MCBS produces two public use data files: Access to Care and Cost and  		Use. The Access to Care file includes information from Medicare claims and  		contains information about on health status, satisfaction with care, income  		information, and demographics The Cost and Use file links respondent-reported  		health care usage with the Medicare claims to produce data on service usage and  		expenditures. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="HOS" id="HOS">MEDICARE HEALTH OUTCOMES SURVEYS  		(HOS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS provides information about the health status and quality of life  		of people enrolled in Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs). </p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS uses a sample of eligible Medicare beneficiaries selected from  		MAOs. A beneficiary is identified as eligible if they do not have end-stage  		renal disease. Prior to 2009, eligibility for participation in the HOS was  		contingent on six months of enrollment in the MAO prior to sample selection;  		however, this requirement is no longer in effect. </p>
<p>The sampling methodology varies by the size of the MAO. MAOs with fewer  		than 500 members do not participate in the HOS. All eligible beneficiaries from  		MAOs consisting of 500-1,200 members are selected to participate. A random  		sample of eligible beneficiaries is selected from large MAOs (more than 1,200  		members). Baseline respondents from the previous year are excluded from MAOs  		with more than 3,000 members. For MAOs with fewer than 3,000 members, eligible  		beneficiaries are included in multiple cohorts. </p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>Sample sizes vary by cohort. The 2009 baseline sample size consisted of  		487,861 respondents, selected from a sample of 1,200 MAOs. Prior to 2007, the  		HOS selected beneficiaries from 1,000 MAOs, yielding a smaller sample size.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS provides national, state, and MAO-level estimates. </p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Each cohort is surveyed at baseline and then contacted again two years  		later to complete a follow-up interview. Both the baseline and follow-up  		interviews use the same questionnaire. </p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS is fielded annually in the spring. Each year, a new cohort is  		selected and completes a baseline interview. A follow-up interview is conducted  		annually and administered to respondents who completed the baseline interview  		for the first time two years earlier. For example, in 2010, Cohort 13 was  		interviewed for the first time and Cohort 11 received a follow-up interview.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS collects information about height and weight. Respondents are  		asked if they have accomplished less than they would like, were limited in work  		or other activities, or experienced any interference with social activities as  		a result of their physical health. The survey also provides information about  		the number of days during the past month that respondents physical health  		was not good and the number of days that their physical or mental health kept  		them from doing usual activities.</p>
<p>The survey queries respondents about specific symptoms experienced  		during the previous four weeks, including chest pain or pressure, shortness of  		breath, arthritis pain, or numbness in feet. Respondents are asked to indicate  		any specific medical conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery  		disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, emphysema, Crohns disease,  		arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, and diabetes. Respondents are asked to  		indicate any vision or hearing limitations.</p>
<p>Respondents are asked about the occurrence of doctors visits to  		discuss their level of physical activity, falling, or balance problems. The  		survey also collects information about any instances of problems with urinary  		incontinence or balance during the past six months. If a respondent indicates a  		problem, the survey asks about the extent of the problem and about any medical  		care received. </p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS asks respondents if they have accomplished less than they would  		like, did not do work or do other activities as carefully as usual, or if their  		social activities were limited as a result of their emotional health.  		Respondents are asked how often they had a lot of energy; felt downhearted and  		blue; or felt calm and peaceful during the past four weeks. The survey provides  		information about and instances of long-term (two years or more) or short-term  		(two weeks or more) sadness, depression or lost pleasure. </p>
<p>The survey asks respondents to rate their current emotional problems in  		comparison to last year. The HOS collects information about the number of days  		during the past month that respondents mental health was not good and the  		number of days that their physical or mental health kept them from doing usual  		activities. </p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS does not include cognitive and intellectual disability measures.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS asks respondents to rate their current general health status,  		how it compares to the previous year, and how it compares to other people the  		same age. The HOS asks all respondents if their health limits moderate  		activities or climbing several flights of stairs. </p>
<p>All respondents are asked about any difficulties with ADLs without  		special equipment or help from another person, including bathing, dressing,  		eating, getting in or out of chairs, walking, or using the toilet. </p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics on the HOS include physical and mental health status, chronic  		medical conditions, limitations in ADLs, depression, smoking, physical health  		symptoms, weight and height, urinary incontinence, osteoporosis testing, and  		fall risk management. The survey also includes demographic questions, including  		race, sex, education, family income, and homeownership. </p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The HOS can be linked to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results  		(SEER) data from the National Cancer Institute. The linked SEER-HOS dataset for  		1998-2003 is publically available. The HOS can also be linked to Medicare Part  		D data. </p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The survey can be used to evaluate how physical and mental health  		evolves over time and to explore the medical service needs of Medicare  		beneficiaries enrolled in MAOs. Researchers can use HOS data to evaluate the  		quality of care received by beneficiaries at MAOs. The information provided in  		the survey can also be used to model the impact of changes in Medicare  		policy.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Limited Data Sets (LDSs) and Research Identifiable Files (RIFs) are  		available for researchers on a restricted-access basis. The PUFs are  		constructed so that individuals and MAOs cannot be identified. The LDSs contain  		all items included in the PUFs, in addition to plan identifiers and  		beneficiary-level health information to allow identification of MAOs. The RIFs  		include personally identifiable information, such as respondent name and health  		insurance claim number, not included in the LDSs, and can be used in linkages  		to administrative data.</p>
<p>Questions on the HOS are used by the National Committee on Quality  		Assurance to calculate Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set  		measures on effectiveness of care.</p>
<p>A modified version of the HOS, called the HOS-M, collects information  		from elderly Medicare beneficiaries and uses a random sample of participants  		from Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly organizations. The HOS-M  		survey instrument includes questions on physical and mental health status,  		ADLs, and memory loss. Unlike the HOS, the HOS-M does not re-interview  		participants. </p>

</ul><h3><a name="NBS" id="NBS">NATIONAL BENEFICIARY SURVEY (NBS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS was developed and implemented as part of an evaluation of  		SSAs Ticket to Work (TTW) program, which began in 2002. The survey  		collects cross-sectional data from a national sample of SSDI and SSI  		beneficiaries, and a sample of TTW program participants. In addition, cohorts  		of TTW participants were followed longitudinally. In all, four rounds of  		interviews were conducted from 2004 to 2010. The primary purposes of the survey  		are to: provide information on the work-related activities of SSI and SSDI  		beneficiaries, particularly as they relate to the implementation of TTW;  		describe the characteristics and program experiences of beneficiaries who  		participate in TTW; gather information about beneficiaries who do not use their  		Tickets and the reasons they do not; evaluate the employment outcomes of TTW  		participants and other SSI and SSDI beneficiaries; and collect data on service  		utilization, barriers to work, and perceptions about TTW and other SSA programs  		designed to help SSI and SSDI beneficiaries find and keep jobs.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS is sponsored by the U.S. Social Security Administration.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS uses a nationally representative sample of SSI and SSDI  		beneficiaries age 18 to full retirement age. Interviews were attempted with all  		sample members or their proxies, regardless of whether the sample member  		resided in the community, group quarters, or an institution. Four rounds of the  		NBS were conducted in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2010. The samples for each round  		are representative of SSI and SSDI beneficiaries on the SSI and SSDI rolls as  		of June of the calendar year preceding each survey year. Because the survey  		focus is employment, the sample design includes an oversample of younger  		beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Each of the first three NBS rounds also contains cross-sectional and  		longitudinal samples of SSI and SSDI beneficiaries participating in TTW. The  		2004 NBS TTW participant sample is representative of SSI and SSDI beneficiaries  		residing in the Phase 1 states where TTW was first implemented who were  		participating in TTW at some time during the first half of 2003.<sup><a href="#note13">13</a></sup> The 2005 NBS TTW sample is representative of SSI  		and SSDI beneficiaries residing in Phase 1 and Phase 2 states who were  		participating in TTW at some time during the first half of 2004. The 2006 NBS  		TTW sample is representative of SSI and SSDI beneficiaries residing in Phase 3  		states.<sup><a href="#note14">14</a></sup> In addition, the sample of Phase 1  		TTW participants interviewed in the first round of the NBS (2004) were  		interviewed in the next two rounds, comprising a three-year longitudinal sample  		of early TTW participants. The sample of Phase 2 TTW participants interviewed  		in the second round of the NBS (2005) were interviewed in Round 3, comprising a  		two-year longitudinal sample of early TTW participants.</p>
<p>The 2010 NBS includes only a cross-sectional sample of TTW participants.  		This sample is representative of SSI and SSDI beneficiaries who assigned their  		Tickets to TTW providers any time after August 1, 2008. That time frame was  		selected to focus on beneficiaries who began participating in TTW after  		implementation of new regulations that substantially changed the programs  		provider payment systems.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The sample sizes for the cross-sectional samples of the four NBS rounds  		are shown in the table below. The Phase 1 Longitudinal TTW sample size for  		those who answered all three survey rounds is 767.</p>

<p>The NBS was not designed to produce regional or state-level estimates.  		The Phase-specific TTW participant samples of the first three NBS rounds are  		representative of TTW participants residing in the subset of states in the  		Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 rollout groups, as applicable to each particular  		round of the survey.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Only members of the 2004 and 2005 TTW participant samples were followed  		longitudinally. The Phase 1 TTW participants in the 2004 sample were followed  		in the 2005 and 2006 NBS rounds. The Phase 2 TTW participants in the 2005  		sample were followed in the 2006 NBS round.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS was administered in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2010.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS includes information on the self-reported main physical,  		sensory, or communication condition(s) causing activity limitations, when onset  		occurred, and if the individual was employed at disability onset; whether any  		prescription medications are taken for physical health conditions; questions  		needed to construct the physical component summary measure of the SF-8 (an  		index measure of physical health status); limitations associated with seeing,  		hearing, speaking, walking, climbing steps, lifting and carrying, using hands  		and fingers, reaching overhead, standing, stooping, crouching, and kneeling,  		getting around inside and outside the home, getting into and out of bed,  		bathing and dressing, shopping, preparing meals, and eating; use of mobility,  		vision, hearing, or speaking aids and devices.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS includes information on the self-reported main mental health  		condition(s) causing activity limitations, when onset occurred; if the  		individual was employed at disability onset; whether any prescription  		medications are taken for mental or emotional conditions; whether the  		respondent received any treatment or counseling for a mental or emotional  		condition, or for alcohol or drug use during the past year; questions needed to  		construct the mental component summary measure of the SF-8 (an index measure of  		mental health status); difficulty associated with concentrating and coping with  		stress; the four CAGE screening questions for alcohol abuse; and questions  		related to drug use (any use, tolerance, emotional or physical problems, being  		told to stop by a doctor).</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS includes information on the self-reported main cognitive or  		intellectual health condition(s) causing activity limitations, when onset  		occurred, and if the individual was employed at disability onset. Some of the  		activity limitations noted above might be applicable to cognitive and  		intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS includes information on general health status; health insurance  		coverage; need for and use of accommodations at work; use of special equipment  		and personal assistance services at work and sources of payment; and receipt of  		disability benefits (SSI, SSDI, workers compensation, private disability,  		and veterans benefits).</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS collects information on disability and current work status;  		current employment; jobs during the previous calendar year; awareness of SSA  		work incentives and TTW; reasons for nonparticipation in TTW;  		employment-related services and supports used in the previous calendar year;  		experiences and satisfaction with TTW; health and functional status; health  		insurance; income and other assistance; and sociodemographic characteristics.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>All NBS rounds have been matched with SSA administrative data, however,  		only a limited set of administrative variables (related to program  		participation and benefits) is available on the PUFs. Other administrative data  		linked to the NBS may be available from SSA on a restricted-access basis.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NBS is useful for analyzing the characteristics, employment service  		use, use of SSA work incentives, job characteristics, and employment-related  		experiences of SSI and SSDI beneficiaries, including TTW participants and for  		producing national-level estimates on these topics. Data from the three NBS  		rounds could potentially be combined to increase sample sizes for purposes of  		studying small subpopulations of beneficiaries (for example, defined by  		disabling health condition).</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Only data from the national cross-sectional samples of the three  		completed NBS rounds are available as PUFs. Data from the TTW samples are  		available from SSA on a restricted-access basis. Data from the fourth NBS round  		(2010) will be made available as a PUF in mid-2011.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NCS" id="NCS">NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY (NCS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS was designed to evaluate the mental health of respondents based  		on the recognized mental disorders and diseases in the Diagnostic and  		Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Three follow-up surveys have been  		conducted: the NCS-2, the longitudinal component to the NCS; the NCS  		Replication (NCS-R), which repeats the NCS questions to a new group of  		respondents; and the NCS for adolescents (NCS-A).</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS was sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health and the  		National Institute on Drug Abuse, and administered by the Institute for Social  		Research Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS, NCS-2, and NCS-R use nationally representative household  		samples of the noninstitutionalized civilian population living in the  		contiguous United States. The NCS includes respondents age 15-48, while the  		NCS-R sample includes respondents age 18 and older. Both the NCS and NCS-R  		include students housed in group quarters. The NCS-2 re-interviewed the  		original NCS respondents. The NCS-A samples adolescents ages 13-17. Data,  		questionnaire and codebook for the NCS-A are not available at this time.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>Both the NCS and NCS-R consist of a diagnostic interview and a risk  		factor interview. A total of 8,098 respondents completed the NCS diagnostic  		interview. Of the initial sample, 5,877 were re-interviewed complete the NCS  		risk factor interview. The NCS risk factor interview subsample contained all  		respondents age 15-24, all respondents age 24-54 who indicated symptoms during  		the diagnostic interview, and a random sample of additional diagnostic  		interview participants. In addition, approximately half of the sample was  		selected to complete the Tobacco Use supplemental section of the NCS.  		Information for the NCS-2 is not available at this time.</p>
<p>A total of 9,282 respondents completed the NCS-R diagnostic interview,  		and 5,692 of the initial sample completed the NCS-R risk factor interview.  		Sample selection for the NCS-R was similar to that of the NCS. The NCS-R risk  		factor interview subsample contained all respondents who met criteria for at  		least one of the mental disorders assessed on the risk factor interview,  		received treatment for a mental disorder, or attempted suicide. A probability  		sample of respondents who met other risk factor criteria were also included,  		and a random sample of additional diagnostic interview participants.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS surveys produce only national-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS-2 re-interviewed the NCS baseline sample after 10 years. Data  		from the NCS-2 are not yet available.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS was first conducted from 1990 to 1992. Three additional  		administrations of the core survey questions occurred from 2001 to 2002. The  		NCS-2 re-interviewed the original NCS respondents. The NCS-R administered the  		NCS questions to a new, nationally representative sample. The NCS-A surveyed a  		new sample of adolescents age 13-17.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS risk factor interview includes an expanded section on physical  		health. Respondents are asked to specify any diseases or major health problems  		that have affected them in the last 12 months, and the associated pain, impact  		on daily life, and date of onset of the condition. Respondents to the NCS-R are  		also asked for their height and weight.</p>
<p>The NCS-2 and NCS-R contain additional questions about physical  		limitations and disabilities. If respondents indicate a limitation in being  		able to do things that most people their age do, both surveys prompt them to  		specify the specific learning disability, physical handicap, physical illness,  		mental illness or emotional or mental disability. For each specific condition  		listed, the surveys collect information about age of onset, severity of  		symptoms, and impact on quality of life (ability to work, have relationships,  		perform basic functions, or need for supervision or help).</p>
<p>The NCS-R includes a set of specific disability questions not included  		in the NCS or NCS-2. These questions provide information about whether  		respondents are blind, deaf, or have a serious speech problem; a hearing  		problem that prevents hearing a normal conversation even with a hearing aid; a  		vision problem that prevents reading a newspaper even when wearing glasses or  		contacts; a learning disability of any kind; any other physical handicap or  		disability; any other condition that substantially limits one or more basic  		physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or  		carrying; or any emotional or mental disability.</p>
<p>The NCS-R also collects information on activity limitations, querying  		the respondent about any difficulties learning, remembering or concentrating;  		getting along with people; dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the  		home; going outside alone to shop or visit a doctors office; working at a  		job or business; or participating fully in school, housework, or other daily  		activities due to a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting three  		months or longer. The survey provides information about the use of assistive  		devices or persons to help with personal care needs.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS, NCS-R and NCS-2 diagnostic interview asks respondents to rate  		their overall mental health status on a five-point scale from excellent to  		poor. The NCS risk factor interview asks about the number of days in the last  		month that the respondent was unable to work or carry out normal activities,  		and whether this was due to emotions, nerves, mental health or drugs/alcohol.  		</p>
<p>The NCS baseline diagnostic interview asks about any unreasonably  		strong fears or phobias; periods of long-term (lasting 2 years or longer)  		or short-term (lasting 2 weeks or more) sadness or depression; manic behavior  		(for a period of 2 days or more); any instances of paranoid behavior (being  		spied or followed, secretly plotted against, reading mind, hearing thoughts,  		etc.).<sup><a href="#note15">15</a></sup> If the respondent experiences any one  		of these symptoms, the NCS collects information on the date of first  		occurrence,<sup><a href="#note16">16</a></sup> frequency, severity, any  		physical effects (changes in weight, sleep, energy level, sexual desire, or  		attention level), avoidance of situations or interruption of everyday life, and  		any inability to take care of basic needs. If the respondent indicates any  		symptoms, the survey also provides information about hospitalization or seeking  		help from doctors, mental health professional, spiritual leaders, counselors,  		or self-help groups. Respondents are asked to provide specific diagnoses and  		prescriptions obtained from health care professionals.</p>
<p>Both the NCS-2 and NCS-R contain a similar screening section. If a  		respondent indicates a limitation in being able to do things that most people  		their age do, the survey prompts the respondent to specify the specific  		learning disability, physical handicap, physical illness, mental illness or  		emotional or mental disability and collects information about the onset and  		severity of the limitations. Based on the responses provided in the screening  		portion of the interview, the respondent skips to specific sections on  		depression, mania, irritable depression, panic, specific phobia, social phobia,  		agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, intermittent explosive disorder,  		suicidality, personality, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic conditions,  		neurasthenia, 30-day functions, 30-day symptoms, tobacco usage, premenstrual  		syndrome, ADD, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, separation  		anxiety, terror, and dementia. In addition to the sections contained in the  		NCS-2, the NCS-R includes sections on eating disorders, obsessive compulsive  		disorder, psychosis, gambling, worries and unhappiness, family burden, and  		perceptions of the past. These sections consist of specific questions focused  		on evaluating aspects of recognized mental disorders and diseases.</p>
<p>The NCS, NCS-2 and NCS-R contain information on alcohol consumption,  		nonmedical use of prescription drugs, and usage of illegal drugs or controlled  		substances. The diagnostic portion of the interview also provides information  		about seeking help for substance abuse problems from doctors, mental health  		professional, spiritual leaders, counselors, or self-help groups and any  		prescriptions obtained from these practitioners.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>If respondents indicate a limitation in being able to do things that  		most people their age do, the NCS-2 and NCS-R prompt them to specify the  		specific learning disability, physical handicap, physical illness, mental  		illness or emotional or mental disability that causes the limitation. The  		surveys also contain information about how long a respondent has experienced a  		limitation and the severity of the limitation.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS risk factor interview asks about health insurance coverage.  		Separate questions are asked about private health care coverage and publically  		provided health insurance, such as Medicaid. If a respondent is covered by  		either public or private insurance, the survey asks how much of the costs the  		plan covers. NCS-2 and NCS-R sections on chronic conditions ask about coverage  		by military health insurance, private health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid.  		The survey provides information about co-payments and costs associated with  		health care visits or prescriptions.</p>
<p>The NCS provides information about disabilities that prevent work for  		both the respondent and spouse. The respondent is asked about current job  		status, and can select permanently disabled as the response.</p>
<p>NCS-2 and NCS-R employment sections ask respondents to identify the main  		reasons they were not working. Response options include physical injury or  		illness, mental or emotional problems, and alcohol or substance abuse. Both  		surveys also query about disabilities that impede the ability to work. The  		survey provides information on absences from work, disability leave, or any  		instances of not working due to a disability. If respondents indicate a  		disability, the survey probes about the type (physical, emotional, combination,  		or other), how many days it will keep them out of work, if they are looking for  		work, and if it will prevent work during the next six months.</p>
<p>General health information on sleeping habits, exercise, how current  		health compares to health in the previous year, frequency of physical activity,  		smoking, general mood, frequency of eating well balanced meals are also  		included. In addition, the NCS-R asks respondents if they consider themselves  		to have a disability, if people who know them consider them to have a  		disability, or if strangers would consider them to have a disability.</p>
<p>The data, questionnaire and codebook for the NCS-A are not yet  		available.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics on the NCS diagnostic interview include activities of daily life;  		relationships with relatives, spouse, and friends; lifetime moods and health  		behaviors; ongoing sadness; mania; alcohol use; nonmedical use of prescription  		drugs; illegal drugs or controlled substance usage; and problem behaviors  		(lying, cheating, stealing, fighting, illegal activities, other violent  		behavior). The risk factor interview, administered to a subset of the original  		NCS sample, includes sections on beliefs and experiences, personality,  		marriage, employment, home and work, children, self-description of traits,  		health, finances, life event history and recent life events, family history,  		and religion. A supplement on tobacco was included in the baseline NCS and  		administered to a subsample of the NCS population.</p>
<p>The NCS-2 includes a screening section followed by detailed sections on  		depression, mania, irritable depression, panic, specific phobia, social phobia,  		agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, intermittent explosive disorder,  		suicidality, substances, services, pharmacoepidemiology, personality,  		post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic conditions, neurasthenia, 30-day  		functions, 30-day symptoms, tobacco usage, premenstrual syndrome, ADD,  		oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, separation anxiety, terrors,  		and dementia. Other general topics include employment, finance, marriage,  		children, social networks, life events, adult demographics, childhood  		demographics, childhood and schooling.</p>
<p>The NCS-R contains all of the sections contained in the NCS-2, in  		addition to eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, psychosis,  		gambling, worries and unhappiness, family burden, and perceptions of the  		past.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS and NCS-R are not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NCS surveys can be used to evaluate the prevalence of mental  		illnesses and to compare the mental health status of people with and without  		disabilities. It can be used to model service use and to explore the reasons  		why people with mental illnesses or disabilities do not seek, or stop seeking,  		medical care. Researchers can also look into the physical effects and  		limitations caused by mental illnesses, as well as the impact of mental health  		and disabilities on various aspects of life, such as finances or personal  		relationships.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NCVS" id="NCVS">NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY  		(NCVS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS collects information on the characteristics and impact of  		household and personal crimes in the United States, as reported by victims.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce administers the NCVS on  		behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS samples civilian households from the most recent  		<a href="#Census">Census</a>, updating the sample periodically to include newly  		constructed housing units. Each member of the household age 12 and older is  		interviewed.<sup><a href="#note17">17</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>Approximately 40,000 households and 75,000 people participate in the  		NCVS annually. The survey is conducted as an overlapping panel in which  		households are followed for three years. New households are added to the sample  		as others complete the NCVS interview series.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS provides national-level estimates. MSA-level estimates are  		available from 1979 to 2004 for counties sampled in the 40 largest MSAs.  		MSA-level estimates are comprised of counties selected for the NCVS sample and  		do not include data from all counties within the MSA.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Each selected household is a part of the sample for a set of seven  		interviews, conducted semiannually over the course of three years.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS, originally named the National Crime Survey, has been fielded  		annually since 1972. The survey questionnaire was re-designed in 1992 to  		capture additional types of personal and household crimes and renamed the  		NCVS.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS Crime Incident Report, administered if a respondent indicates  		being victimized by one or more crimes in the basic questionnaire, collects  		information about whether a respondent is deaf or has serious difficulty  		hearing, or is blind or has serious difficulty seeing even when wearing  		glasses. The Crime Incident Report also provides information on difficulties  		concentrating, remembering or making decisions; walking or climbing stairs;  		dressing or bathing; or doing errands alone because of a physical, mental, or  		emotional condition. It also collects information about whether respondents  		believe they were victimized due to a disability, and if so, which specific  		limitation, disability, or medical condition.</p>
<p>The NCVS also provides information about injuries, physical problems,  		and medical care related to any reported crimes.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS Crime Incident Report, administered if a respondent indicates  		being victimized by one or more crimes in the basic questionnaire, provides  		information on difficulties concentrating, remembering or making decisions;  		dressing or bathing; or doing errands alone because of a physical, mental, or  		emotional condition. The Crime Incident Report collects information about  		whether respondents believe they were victimized due to a disability, and if  		so, which specific limitation, disability, or medical condition.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS Crime Incident Report, administered if a respondent indicates  		being victimized by one or more crimes in the basic questionnaire, provides  		information on difficulties concentrating, remembering or making decisions;  		dressing or bathing; or doing errands alone because of a physical, mental, or  		emotional condition. The Crime Incident Report collects information about  		respondents believe they were victimized due to a disability, and if so, which  		specific limitation, disability, or medical condition.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The Crime Incident Report asks about limitations in work or usual  		activities as they relate to reported incidents. The report collects  		information about lost days from work. If a respondent did not have a job at  		the time of the incident, the respondent is queried about major activities the  		week of the incident. The respondent can select unable to work among other  		response options.</p>
<p>If a respondent reports an incident on the survey, the NCVS collects  		information about medical insurance coverage. The question does not distinguish  		between private medical insurance or public benefits, such as Medicaid,  		veterans benefits, or other public programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS collects information about employment; type of living quarters;  		and attempted or committed criminal victimization including personal or  		household property thefts, break-ins, vandalism, vehicle theft, personal  		attacks, threats, and sexual harassment or abuse. If the respondent reports one  		or more crimes, the NCVS Crime Incident Report provides additional details,  		including frequency, characteristics of the crime and the offender(s), whether  		the crime was reported to the police or reasons for not reporting the crime,  		and repercussions for the victim.</p>
<p>Recent supplemental sections focus on identity theft and school-related  		crime.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS can be used to assess the incidence and nature of victimization  		of persons with disabilities. More specifically, the data can be used to  		determine if people with disabilities are targeted based on their limitations,  		and if victimization varies by condition. It can be used to model the  		probability of victimization by disability status. Researchers can also compare  		reported crimes to those not reported to the police by victim characteristics.  		The data in the NCVS can be used to estimate the prevalence of unreported  		crimes, in comparison to police records or other official statistics for people  		with and without disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The NCVS includes supplemental survey sections. The school-related crime  		supplement has been included periodically since 1989. A stalking victimization  		section was included in 2006, and the 2008 NCVS includes a new supplement  		focused on identity theft.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NELS" id="NELS">NATIONAL EDUCATION LONGITUDINAL STUDY  		(NELS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NELS is a longitudinal survey that followed 8thgrade students for 12  		years. The survey collected information from students, parents, teachers, and  		school principals and provides information about high school completion, school  		environment, postsecondary education, job preparation and placement, and  		marriage and family formation.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>NELS was sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S.  		Department of Education.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>NELS used a nationally representative sample of 8th grade students in  		both public and private schools. The survey utilized stratified sampling to  		select schools proportional to the size of the 8th grade class. A total of  		1,057 schools from around the country participated in the NELS and a random  		sample of 8th grade students was selected from participating schools. Teachers,  		parents, and school principals corresponding to each student were also selected  		for interview.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>A total of 24,599 8th graders participated in the 1988 fielding of the  		NELS. Respondents were added at the first two follow-up interviews to maintain  		a representative sample throughout the longitudinal study.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NELS provides national level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The original sample was re-interviewed four times in 1990, 1992, 1994,  		and 2000.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NELS was first fielded in 1988. The original sample of 8th grade  		students was re-interviewed four times in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000. The  		survey consists of four components: a student interview, teacher interview,  		parent interview, and school principal interview. School principals were  		interviewed in 1988, 1990, and 1992 about the school. Two teachers of each  		student were interviewed in 1988, 1990, and 1992 regarding the student,  		themselves, and the school environment. A parent was also interviewed in 1988  		and 1992 about family characteristics and student activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The survey asked the parent to describe any impairments experienced by  		their children and if their children received any special services for a visual  		handicap not correctable by glasses; hearing problem; deafness; speech problem;  		orthopedic problem; physical disability; or another health problem. The survey  		queried the parent about their childrens enrollment in special programs  		or services, including special services for orthopedically handicapped  		students.</p>
<p>The NELS teacher questionnaire asked the teacher to indicate if the  		student had ever fallen behind due to a health problem, or currently had a  		learning disability or physical/emotional handicap that was affecting the  		students schoolwork.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The survey asked the parent to describe any problems and if their  		children received any special services for an emotional problem or another  		health problem. The survey queried the parent about their childrens  		enrollment in any special programs or services.</p>
<p>The survey asked questions about student health behavior including  		frequency of smoking, using illegal drugs, drinking any amount of alcohol, and  		binge drinking.</p>
<p>The NELS teacher questionnaire asked the teacher to indicate if the  		student had ever fallen behind due to a health problem, or currently had a  		learning disability or physical/emotional handicap that was affecting the  		students schoolwork.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The survey asked the parent to describe any problems and if their  		children received any special services for a specific learning problem (for  		example, dyslexia, or other reading, spelling, writing, or math difficulties);  		mental retardation; or another health problem. The survey queried the parent  		about their childrens enrollment in any special programs or services,  		including special education services for students with learning  		disabilities.</p>
<p>The NELS teacher questionnaire asked the teacher to indicate if the  		student had ever fallen behind due to a health problem, or currently had a  		learning disability or physical/emotional handicap that was affecting the  		students schoolwork.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NELS collected information about the number of days absent from  		school due to illness and whether the student became seriously ill or disabled  		during the response period. The NELS also collected information about the  		sample members employment status following high school and asked all  		students if they were limited in the kind of job or work they could do because  		of any impairment or health problem. If respondents had dropped out of high  		school, they could specify that this was for a health-related reason.</p>
<p>Students were asked whether their parents were currently working and  		could select that they were not because they were disabled. Parents were asked  		if they had worked in the past week, and if not could respond that they were  		disabled and not looking for work. The NELS also collected information about  		whether a family member became seriously ill or disabled during the reporting  		period.</p>
<p>The NELS collected information about health insurance coverage.  		Respondents could select that they had health insurance coverage through  		Medicaid, a private health plan, or a plan provided by an employer. The survey  		also collected information about receipt of public assistance, including  		separate responses for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental  		Nutrition Assistance Program, housing assistance or public housing, and  		Medicaid or other public programs for medical expenses.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics on the student questionnaire include language use; family;  		opinions about oneself and attitudes; plans for the future; jobs and chores;  		school life; schoolwork; school experiences and activities; religion; money and  		work; and friendships. If students had dropped out of school, they were asked  		to complete an interview focused on reasons why they left school and plans for  		the future.</p>
<p>The third and fourth follow-up interviews for students contain sections  		on current activities; employment; job-related training; high school  		completion; postsecondary education; adult education; family formation; income;  		voting behavior; health insurance; health behaviors; race and ethnicity; and  		residence.</p>
<p>Topics on the school principal questionnaire include school  		characteristics and composition including the percentage of students receiving  		special education services; availability of special education services; student  		characteristics; school climate; teaching staff characteristics; school  		programs; school admission policies and practices; and grading and testing  		structure. Teachers were asked to provide information on the student; class  		information; teacher background and activities; and school climate.</p>
<p>The parent questionnaire includes questions on family background;  		childs school life; childs family life; childs opinions about  		school; childs future; financial information and educational costs.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NELS can be linked to student records in a restricted use dataset.  		PUFs are available with limited student record information, but use of  		restricted data is limited to researchers with a National Center for Education  		Statistics restricted data license.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NELS can be used to investigate educational outcomes for students  		with physical, emotional, or learning disabilities. Researchers can compare  		employment, postsecondary education, and family life for students with and  		without disabilities. The data about schools and teachers can be used to  		explore the impact of school resources or teacher education on students with  		disabilities. The NELS can also be used to investigate the characteristics of  		high school dropouts.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NHANES" id="NHANES">NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION  		EXAMINATION SURVEY (NHANES)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of NHANES is to assess the health and nutritional status of  		adults and children in the United States by means of interviews and physical  		examinations. This information is collected to determine the prevalence of  		major diseases and identify risk factors for diseases; to provide the basis for  		national standards for measurements, such as height, weight, and blood  		pressure; and to guide further health studies and research that will develop  		health policies and programs and expand the nations health knowledge.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NHANES is sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics,  		Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>Starting with the 1999 survey, the NHANES uses a multistage stratified  		sample of the United States civilian, noninstitutionalized population of all  		ages. The sample includes the noninstitutionalized group quarters population.  		It oversamples adolescents aged 12-19 years, persons 60 and older, African  		Americans, Mexican Americans, and, starting in 2000, low-income Caucasians.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NHANES uses a sample of about 5,000 individuals each year.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NHANES is designed to be a nationally representative sample of  		individuals, and is not representative at regional or state levels.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Starting with the 1976 survey, the NHANES does not follow individuals  		longitudinally.<sup><a href="#note18">18</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>NHANES was first fielded in 1971. Previously, a similar survey, called  		the National Health Examination Survey, was conducted from 1960 to 1970. In  		1971, the surveys name was changed and a large nutrition component was  		added. In addition, data collection was broadened to include a representative  		sample of the entire United States population age 1-74 years. NHANES I was  		administered between 1971 and 1975, NHANES II between 1976 and 1980, and NHANES  		III between 1988 and 1994. NHANES I sampled individuals aged 1-74 years. NHANES  		II was similar in content to NHANES I but sampled individuals age 6 months-74  		years. NHANES III included more disability measures (for example, questions  		about functional limitations, need for assistance with ADLs and IADLs, the use  		of assistive devices, and Social Security benefits due to disability) than  		NHANES I and II and sampled individuals age two months and over.</p>
<p>A special study of Hispanic populations (HHANES) was conducted in  		1982-84, focusing on the health issues common among Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto  		Rican Americans.</p>
<p>Continuous NHANES was fielded in 1999 and has been administered as an  		annual nationally representative survey, rather than as a series of surveys  		focusing on different populations and topics, as it was previously. Continuous  		NHANES selects a new sample every year, and the sample is interviewed and  		examined once. Survey data are released every two years in order to obtain a  		sufficient sample size, and the survey instrument is updated every two  		years.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NHANES includes information obtained from a physical exam on the  		ability to perform timed walks; spinal mobility; body measurements; and vision  		and hearing impairments.</p>
<p>A question about vision impairments asks if individuals have trouble  		seeing, even when they are wearing glasses or contact lenses.</p>
<p>Questions about hearing ask individuals how good their hearing is and if  		they are deaf. Respondents at least 70 years of age are asked if they have ever  		worn a hearing aid; if they have worn a hearing aid at least five hours a week  		in the past 12 months; if they have ever used assistive listening devices, such  		as FM systems, closed-captioned television, or amplified telephone; if they  		have been bothered by ringing, roaring, or buzzing in their ears or head that  		lasts five minutes or more, how long this has bothered them, if this only  		bothers them after listening to loud sounds or music, if it bothers them when  		they go to sleep, and how big of a problem it is; if they have ever used  		firearms; if they have ever had a job where they were exposed to loud noise for  		five or more hours a week; if they have ever been exposed to loud noise for  		five or more hours a week outside of a job; and how often they wear hearing  		protection devices when exposed to loud noises or sounds.</p>
<p>Questions about physical functioning ask individuals under age 20 if  		they have an impairment or health problem that limits their ability to walk,  		run, or play;<sup><a href="#note19">19</a></sup> if the impairment or health  		problem has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or longer; and if they  		receive special education or early intervention services. Questions about  		physical functioning ask respondents of all ages if a physical, mental, or  		emotional problem now keeps them from working at a job or business; if they are  		limited in the kind or amount of work they can do because of a physical,  		mental, or emotional problem; if they have difficulty walking without using any  		special equipment because of a health problem; and if they are limited in any  		way because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem. If the answer to any  		of these questions is yes or respondents are at least age 59, they are asked  		how much difficulty they have doing the following activities without using any  		special equipment: managing money; walking short distances or a quarter mile;  		walking 10 steps without resting; stooping, crouching, or kneeling; lifting or  		carrying something as heavy as 10 pounds; doing chores around the house;  		preparing meals; standing up from an armless straight chair; getting in and out  		of bed; eating dressing; standing for about two hours; sitting up for about two  		hours; reaching over their heads; using fingers to grasp or handle small  		objects; going out (for example, shopping, to the movies, or to sporting  		events); participating in social activities; doing things to relax at home or  		for leisure; and pushing or pulling large objects. If respondents had any  		difficulty they were asked what condition or health problem causes them to have  		difficulty with or need help with the activities. All individuals are asked if  		they now have any health problem that requires them to use special equipment,  		such as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed, or a special telephone.</p>
<p>Questions specific to physical health problems ask individuals at least  		age 12 for how many days in the past 30 days their physical health was not good  		and how many days the problem kept them from doing usual activities, such as  		self-care, work, school, or recreation.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Questions ask individuals under age 20 if they receive special education  		or early intervention services. Questions ask respondents of all ages if a  		physical, mental, or emotional problem now keeps them from working at a job or  		business, limits the kind or amount of work they can do, or limits them in any  		way. If the answer to any of these questions is yes or individuals are at least  		age 59, they are asked how much difficulty they have doing the following  		activities without using any special equipment: managing money; doing chores  		around the house; preparing meals; going out to things like shopping, movies,  		or sporting events; participating in social activities; and doing things to  		relax at home or for leisure. If respondents had any difficulty they are asked  		what condition or health problem causes them to have difficulty with or need  		help with the activities. Individuals at least age 12 are asked for how many  		days in the past 30 days their mental health was not good and how many days the  		problem kept them from doing usual activities, such as self-care, work, school,  		or recreation; and how many days they felt worried, tense or anxious.</p>
<p>Questions about depression asked of individuals at last age 12 include  		information about how often over the last two weeks they were bothered by  		having little interest or pleasure in doing things; felt down, depressed, or  		hopeless; had trouble falling or staying asleep, or slept too much; felt tired  		or had little energy; poor appetite or over ate; felt bad about themselves,  		felt that they are failures, or felt they let themselves or their families  		down; had trouble concentrating on things like reading the newspaper or  		watching TV; moved or spoke so slowly that other people could have noticed, or  		were so fidgety or restless that they moved around a lot more than usual; and  		had thoughts that they would be better off dead or of hurting themselves. If  		the answer is yes, respondents are asked how difficult these problems make it  		for them to do their work, take care of things at home, or get along with  		people.</p>
<p>Individuals age 12-69 are asked if they have ever used marijuana; their  		age at time of first use; if they have ever used marijuana at least once a  		month for more than one year, and if so at what age they started; how long it  		has been since they last used marijuana once a month for one year; how often  		they usually used marijuana each month; how many joints or pipes they usually  		smoked in a day; how long it has been since they last used marijuana; and how  		many days in the last 30 days they used marijuana. Other questions solicit  		information about cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine use. Individuals are  		asked if they have ever used each drug; how old they were at time of first use;  		how long it has been since they last used it; how many times they have used it  		during their lives (not asked for heroin); and how many times they used it  		during the past 30 days. Additional questions ask if individuals have ever used  		a needle to inject a drug not prescribed by a doctor; which drug they have  		injected; how old they were the first time they did this; how long it has been  		since they last did this; how many times they have done this during their  		lives; how often they injected when they did it most often; and if they have  		ever been in a drug rehabilitation program.</p>
<p>Individuals age 12-19 are asked if they have ever tried cigarette  		smoking; how old they were when they smoked a cigarette for the first time; how  		many days they smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days; how many cigarettes they  		smoked per day on days they smoked; how soon they smoke after waking up; what  		brand of cigarettes they usually smoked in the past 30 days; if they smoked  		menthol or nonmenthol cigarettes; if the cigarettes of the brand they reported  		smoking were regular, lights, or ultralights; if they had stopped smoking for 1  		day or longer in the past 12 months because they were trying to quit; if they  		used any product containing nicotine in the past 5 days; which nicotine product  		they used; and for each product (cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco,  		snuff) how many days they used it in the past 5 days; how many they used each  		day on the days they used the product in the past 5 days; when they last used  		it; how many days in the last 5 days they used any nicotine product to help  		them stop smoking; and when they last used a product containing nicotine.</p>
<p>Individuals at least age 20 are asked if they have smoked at least 100  		cigarettes in their entire lives; how old they were when they started to smoke  		cigarettes fairly regularly; how often they now smoke cigarettes; and how long  		it has been since they quit smoking cigarettes. If it had been one year or  		longer since they quit smoking cigarettes they were asked how old they were  		when they last smoked cigarettes; how many cigarettes they typically smoked per  		day; how soon after waking up they smoke; how many days they smoked cigarettes  		in the past 30 days; how many cigarettes they smoked on days they smoked in the  		past 30 days; if they could show the interviewer the pack of cigarettes they  		usually smoke in order to identify the brand; for the universal product code  		from the cigarette pack; if the cigarette product is filtered or nonfiltered;  		if the product is mentholated or nonmentholated; what the cigarette product  		size is; and what other name brand qualifiers for the product are.</p>
<p>Individuals age 12-19 are asked how old they were when they had their  		first drink of alcohol; on how many days during their lives they had at least  		one drink of alcohol; on how many days in the past 30 days they had at least  		one drink; and on how many days in the past 30 days they had five or more  		drinks in a row within a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Individuals at least age 20 are asked if they have ever had at least 12  		drinks in any 1 year; if they have had at least 12 drinks in their entire  		lives; how often they drank any alcoholic beverage in the past 12 months; how  		many drinks they had on days they drank in the past 12 months; on how many days  		they had five or more drinks in the past 12 months; and if there was ever a  		time when they drank five or more drinks almost every day.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Questions ask if individuals are limited in any way because of  		difficulty remembering or because they experience periods of confusion.  		Questions ask individuals under age 20 if they receive special education or  		early intervention services. Questions ask respondents of all ages if a  		physical, mental, or emotional problem now keeps them from working at a job or  		business, limits the kind or amount of work they can do, or limits them in any  		way. If the answer to any of these questions is yes or respondents are age 59  		or older they are asked how much difficulty they have doing the following  		activities: managing money; doing chores around the house; preparing meals;  		eating; dressing; going out (for example, shopping, to the movies, or to  		sporting events); and doing things to relax at home or for leisure. If  		respondents have any difficulty they are asked what condition or health problem  		causes them to have difficulty with or need help with the activities.</p>

<p>The NHANES includes information on receipt of Social Security benefits  		due to disability; dietary habits; body measurements; laboratory test results;  		dental health; risk factors for disease (for example, smoking, alcohol  		consumption); and reproductive health.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Core questions and examination procedures, which are repeated in each  		two-year cycle of the survey, gather information about anemia; cardiovascular  		disease; diabetes; environmental exposure; eye diseases; hearing loss;  		infectious diseases; kidney diseases; nutrition, obesity; oral health;  		osteoporosis; physical fitness and physical functioning; reproductive history  		and sexual behavior; respiratory disease; sexually transmitted diseases; and  		vision.</p>
<p>The early surveys collected information on the prevalence of certain  		medically defined illnesses; information on the distribution of a variety of  		physical, physiological, and psychological measurements; and demographic and  		socioeconomic data. Continuous NHANES incorporated additional core components,  		such as medical examination components, laboratory tests, and an environmental  		health component.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>Continuous NHANES has been linked to the NDI and Medicare data.  		Continuous NHANES is in the process of being linked to air quality data and  		traffic indicators data. The NHANES III has been linked to SSA data, the NDI;  		Medicare data; and air quality data. NHANES II has been linked to the NDI.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NHANES provides data on demographic and socioeconomic information,  		blood work, physical functioning, and general health status obtained from a  		questionnaire, laboratory tests, and a physical examination. It can be used to  		study the relationship between disability and disease, diet, environmental risk  		factors, blood components, and physical anomalies. NHANES collects genetic  		information from a portion of participants blood samples and thus, has  		the potential to provide new information for understanding the relationship  		between genetics and disabilities. Since NHANES also collects information on  		environmental risks, (for example, exposure to pesticides and dietary habits),  		NHANES can be used to study the extent to which disabilities result from  		genetic predispositions versus environmental factors.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The NHANES has oversampled different subgroups depending on the survey  		year. For example, in 2007, NHANES oversampled the entire Hispanic population,  		rather than just the Mexican American population. More participants age 40 and  		over were included in the sample and fewer age 12-19 were included than in  		previous years. Oversampling of those age 12-19 was discontinued to allow for  		oversampling of the Hispanic population.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NHIS" id="NHIS">NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY  		(NHIS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS is the principal source of information on the health of the  		civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States. It produces  		timely statistical information on the prevalence, distribution, and effects of  		illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or  		because of such conditions. Survey results have been instrumental in providing  		data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving  		national health objectives.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS is sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics,  		Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services. Some supplements are added by other organizations, which provide  		funding for those sections. The Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Commerce  		administers the NHIS.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS uses a cross-sectional sample of the civilian  		noninstitutionalized population of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  		Households and noninstitutional group quarters are sampled based on information  		from the previous <a href="#Census">Census</a>, as well as new building  		permits. Black, Hispanic, and Asian households have been oversampled since  		2006, by pre-screening based on race or via selection of sampling areas based  		on racial and ethnic composition. Some information is collected for each member  		of the household, including detailed demographic characteristics and  		information on health status and limitations, injuries, health care access and  		utilization, health insurance, and income and assets. Additional information on  		health status, health care services, and health behavior is collected from one  		adult and one child randomly selected from each family.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS sample size is approximately 35,000 households containing about  		87,500 individuals each month. Budget cuts have resulted in smaller samples for  		some years.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS can support regional and state-level estimates. Data with  		geographic information is available on a restricted-access basis.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS does not provide longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS has been conducted since 1957, though it has been substantially  		revised about once every ten years. The most recent revision occurred in 1997.  		A new sample is selected for interview each week throughout the year and  		interviewed once. In some years, one week per month has been dropped as a  		cost-saving measure.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS includes information on whether respondents face limitations in  		play or work activities (depending on age); whether children use or have used  		special education or early intervention services; specific conditions,  		including vision or hearing problems and arthritis; whether those conditions  		cause limitations in activities; whether a health problem requires the use of  		assistive equipment; and activity limitations. Questions also address whether  		and to what degree, as the result of a health problem, the respondent has  		difficulty doing the following without assistive equipment or the help of  		others: walking a short distance or up stairs; standing; sitting; stooping,  		bending or kneeling; reaching over their head; grasping small objects; lifting  		or carrying; pushing or pulling large objects; going out (for example,  		shopping, to the movies, or to sporting events); participating in social  		events; or doing things at home for leisure; as well as what condition causes  		these difficulties and how long that condition has persisted. Respondents are  		asked for their height and weight.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS includes information on whether respondents face limitations in  		play or work activities; whether children use or have used special education or  		early interventions services; whether children have visited a doctor due to  		emotional or behavioral problems; specific activity limitations; limitations  		caused by difficulty remembering, or periods of confusion; specific conditions  		(for example, depression and anxiety); and time of limitation onset.  		Respondents are asked how often in the past 30 days they have felt nervous;  		restless or fidgety; hopeless; that everything was an effort; or worthless; and  		how much these interfered with normal activities. Questions also address  		whether and to what degree, as the result of a health problem, the respondent  		has difficulty doing the following without assistive equipment or the help of  		others: going out (for example, shopping, to the movies, or to sporting events;  		participating in social events); doing things at home for leisure; as well as  		what condition causes these difficulties and how long that condition has  		persisted.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS includes information on whether respondents face limitations in  		play or work activities; whether children use or have used special education or  		early intervention services; limitations caused by difficulty remembering, or  		periods of confusion; specific activity limitations; specific conditions (for  		example, mental retardation); and time of limitation onset. Questions also  		address whether and to what degree, as the result of a health problem, the  		respondent has difficulty doing the following without assistive equipment or  		the help of others; going out (for example, shopping, to the movies, or to  		sporting events); participating in social events; or doing things at home for  		leisure; as well as what condition causes these difficulties and how long that  		condition has persisted.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS includes information on general health status; details on  		injuries and poisonings including, health care received in response and days of  		work or school missed as a result; health care use; details on health insurance  		coverage, including the type of plan (for example, Medicaid, Medicare,  		private), deductibles, and reasons for not having coverage; medical  		expenditures; household members who are not working due to a disability;  		disability benefits received; applications for SSDI benefits; risks experienced  		at the worksite; and workers compensation claims.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS is comprised of core sections and supplements. The core  		addresses demographic characteristics, health status and limitations, injuries,  		health care access and utilization, health insurance, and income and assets.  		Supplemental sections can be fielded on a regular basis or only once. Past  		supplements have addressed cancer screening, complementary and alternative  		medicine, childrens mental health, and health care utilization</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS has been linked to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  		data on air quality, the NDI, Medicare enrollment and claims data, and SSA  		data. In the future NHIS files will be linked with information on Medicare Part  		D and Medicaid enrollment and claims data, and information on end-stage renal  		disease from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney  		Diseases. Analytical files will also be released with linked NHIS and Medicare  		data, including the beneficiarys reason for Medicare entitlement, total  		number of months of Medicare entitlement, Group Health Plan enrollment, and  		summarized Medicare service charges and reimbursement amounts.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS provides detailed information on issues related to health and  		health care. It can be used to estimate the number of individuals in a region  		experiencing a specific limitation; to determine the number at a particular  		level of income (for example, between the state Medicaid threshold and 133  		percent of the federal poverty level) who are forgoing medical care because of  		cost; or to track the share of individuals experiencing specific conditions, or  		exposed to certain risks, over time. Because it is linked with Social Security  		administrative data, it can be used to study health-related issues of those  		receiving Social Security disability benefits, or who received them in the  		past.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Since 2008, the NHIS has included disability questions as part of an  		effort to develop and implement a standardized set of questions across multiple  		surveys in multiple countries. The questions in the 2010 survey focus on  		limitations in activities such as seeing, walking, and making decisions, and  		are similar to those used in the <a href="#CPS">CPS</a>.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NHIS-D" id="NHIS-D">NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY ON  		DISABILITY (NHIS-D)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The goal of the NHIS-D was to develop a series of questionnaires that  		would provide a useful set of disability measures while maintaining a balance  		between the social, administrative, and medical considerations involved in  		disability measurement. The NHIS-D is not limited to one definition of  		disability; therefore, it allows analysts from varying programs to combine data  		items in different ways to meet specific agency or program needs. It is  		designed to collect data that can be used to understand disability, to develop  		public health policy, to produce simple prevalence estimates of selected health  		conditions, and to provide descriptive baseline statistics on the effects of  		disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D was a collaborative effort sponsored by several components in  		the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of  		Education, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Social Security  		Administration, the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, and  		the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The Phase I Disability questionnaire was administered to a  		cross-sectional sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the  		50 states and the District of Columbia which had been selected to participate  		in the core portion of the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> in 1994 or 1995. The 1995  		<a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> oversampled Black and Hispanic persons. The Phase I  		Disability questionnaire collected information about all members of the  		<a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> households from an adult who was knowledgeable about  		the health of household members, and was used as a screening device to  		determine eligibility for the second phase of the survey. Individuals were  		screened into Phase II if they were identified as children with disabilities;  		people with a history of polio; people with mental retardation or developmental  		disabilities; people with sensory impairments; assistive device users; people  		with mental illness; people with cognitive impairments; people with functional  		limitations or limitations in ADLs or IADLs; SSI recipients; SSI applicants;  		SSDI recipients; SSDI applicants; belonging to a residual category which  		included persons who received certain disability pensions or had an artificial  		limb; or healthy elderly, including people over age 69 not selected as disabled  		by any of the other policy groups. Information in Phase II was collected by the  		individual with the disability when possible.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D used a sample of approximately 202,560 individuals for Phase  		I and 32,788 for Phase II.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D can support state and regional estimates, but detailed  		geographic data are not available on PUFs.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D does not provide longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D was fielded from 1994 to 1995. All households who  		participated in the <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> in 1994 or 1995 completed Phase I  		of the survey, and individuals were screened into Phase II based on their  		responses to Phase I and the core <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Phase I of the NHIS-D collects information on whether any household  		member has serious difficulty seeing, even when using glasses or contacts, and  		if so what condition causes the difficulty, whether the person is legally  		blind, and whether the difficulty is expected to continue for at least 12  		months; whether anyone uses a hearing aid, whether anyone has serious  		difficulty hearing (even when wearing a hearing aid), what problem or condition  		causes the difficulty, whether they are able to hear loud noises, whether the  		problem is expected to continue for at least 12 months, and whether they use an  		assistive device.</p>
<p>Questions in Phase I also address whether anyone has serious difficulty  		communicating; lifting 10 pounds; walking up 10 steps; walking a quarter mile;  		standing for 10 minutes; bending; reaching over their head; using fingers to  		grasp or handle; holding a pen or pencil; and if so how much difficulty is  		experienced, when the difficulty first occurred, and whether it is expected to  		last 12 months or longer. Questions also ask whether because of a physical,  		mental, or emotional problem anyone gets assistance, needs to be reminded  		about, has difficulty, or uses special equipment for bathing; dressing; eating;  		getting in and out of bed and chairs; toileting; or getting around inside the  		home, and if they have difficulty how much. The survey also addresses whether  		because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem anyone gets help or  		supervision with, or has difficulty preparing meals; using the telephone; doing  		heavy work around the house; doing light work around the house; shopping for  		personal items; managing money and if they have difficulty how much.</p>
<p>Phase I also asks whether the respondent thinks any household member  		under age 18 has significant problems or delays in physical development and if  		so if a doctor has discussed or mentioned it; if anyone uses assistive  		equipment to get around; and if anyone has an artificial arm, leg, hand, or  		foot.</p>
<p>Phase II collects information on whether the person screened into the  		disability section experiences any difficulty doing the following without help:  		walking for a quarter mile; walking up 10 steps; standing for 2 hours; sitting  		for 2 hours; stooping, crouching, or kneeling; reaching up over their head;  		reaching out; using fingers to grasp or handle; lifting or carrying 10 or 25  		pounds, and if so how much difficulty and how long they have had  		difficulty.</p>
<p>Phase II also asks whether, due to a health or physical problem, the  		respondent experiences any difficulty bathing; dressing; eating; getting in and  		out of bed and chairs; walking; getting outside; toileting; preparing meals;  		using the telephone; doing heavy housework; doing light housework; managing  		medication; shopping for groceries and personal items; managing money; or  		getting to places outside of walking distance; and when they do these  		activities by themselves without any special equipment how much difficulty they  		experience and whether it is tiring, takes a long time, or is painful.  		Respondents are asked if they use special equipment for these activities, and  		if so whether when they do not it is tiring, takes a long time, or is painful.  		Respondents are asked if they receive help, and if so if it is tiring, takes a  		long time, or is painful. Respondents are also asked if they have someone who  		supervises or stays nearby during these activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Phase I of the NHIS-D gathers information on whether any household  		member has a lot of trouble making or keeping friendships; getting along with  		other people in social or recreational settings; concentrating long enough to  		complete everyday tasks; coping with day-to-day stresses; is frequently  		confused, disoriented, or forgetful; has phobias or unreasonably strong fears;  		or has specific mental health conditions. If an individual is reported to have  		any mental health conditions the survey asks whether as a result they are  		unable to work or limited in the kind or amount of work they can do, and if  		they have trouble finding or keeping a job, or doing job tasks.</p>
<p>Questions also ask whether because of a physical, mental, or emotional  		problem anyone gets assistance or needs to be reminded about bathing; dressing;  		eating; getting in and out of bed and chairs; toileting; or getting around  		inside the home. The survey also asks if, because of a physical, mental, or  		emotional problem, anyone gets help or supervision with, or has difficulty  		preparing meals; using the telephone; doing heavy work around the house; doing  		light work around the house; shopping for personal items; or managing money and  		if they experience difficulty how much.</p>
<p>Phase II of the NHIS-D asks if, because of a health or physical problem,  		the respondent has any difficulty preparing meals; using the telephone; doing  		heavy housework; doing light housework; managing medication; shopping for  		groceries and personal items; managing money; or getting to places outside of  		walking distance, and if they do the activity by themselves and without any  		special equipment how much difficulty they experience and whether it is tiring,  		takes a long time, or is painful. Respondents are asked if they use special  		equipment for these activities, and if so when they do not whether it is  		tiring, takes a long time, or is painful. Respondents are asked if they receive  		help, and if so if it is tiring, takes a long time, or is painful. Respondents  		are also asked if they have someone who supervises or stays nearby during these  		activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Phase I of the NHIS-D gathers information on whether any household  		member has a lot of trouble making or keeping friendships; getting along with  		other people in social or recreational settings; concentrating long enough to  		complete everyday tasks; coping with day-to-day stresses; are frequently  		confused, disoriented, or forgetful; have phobias or unreasonably strong fears;  		or have specific cognitive health conditions. If an individual is reported to  		have any cognitive health conditions the survey asks whether as a result they  		are unable to work or limited in the kind or amount of work they can do, and if  		they have trouble finding or keeping a job, or doing job tasks.</p>
<p>Questions also ask whether because of a physical, mental, or emotional  		problem anyone gets assistance, or needs to be reminded about bathing;  		dressing; eating; getting in and out of bed and chairs; toileting; or getting  		around inside the home. The survey also asks if, because of a physical, mental,  		or emotional problem, anyone gets help or supervision with, or has difficulty  		preparing meals; using the telephone; doing heavy work around the house; doing  		light work around the house; shopping for personal items; or managing money and  		if they experience difficulty how much.</p>
<p>Phase II of the NHIS-D asks if, because of a health or physical problem,  		the respondent has any difficulty preparing meals; using the telephone; doing  		heavy housework; doing light housework; managing medication; shopping for  		groceries and personal items; managing money; or getting to places outside of  		walking distance, and if they do the activity by themselves and without any  		special equipment how much difficulty they experience and whether it is tiring,  		takes a long time, or is painful. Respondents are asked if they use special  		equipment for these activities, and if so when they do not whether it is  		tiring, takes a long time, or is painful. Respondents are asked if they receive  		help, and if so if it is tiring, takes a long time, or is painful. Respondents  		are also asked if they have someone who supervises or stays nearby during these  		activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Phase II of the NHIS-D asks whether an ongoing health problem,  		impairment or disability prevents the respondent completely from working or  		limits the kind or amount of work they can do.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics covered in Phase I include: sensory, communication, and mobility;  		vision, hearing, and mobility aids; communication, understanding, and learning  		(age 5 and older); dizziness, balance, ringing in ears, and sense of smell and  		taste (age 18 and older); developmental disability conditions (including  		polio); disability; ADL limitations (age 5 and older); IADL limitations (age 18  		and older); functional limitation (age 18 and older); mental health (age 18 and  		older); services and benefits (age 18 and older); special health needs of  		children (primarily age 17 and under); early child development (age 5 and  		under); education (age 17 and under); relationship to respondent (age 17 and  		under); and perceived disability (all ages).</p>
<p>For children identified in Phase I, additional information was collected  		on utilization and need for services, functional assessment, emotional and  		behavioral development, and the impact of the child's disability on the family.  		</p>
<p>For adults identified in Phase I or age 69 or older, the Phase II  		questionnaire obtained more extensive information about the persons with  		disabilities on issues such as employment, use of services and benefits,  		transportation and personal assistance needs, housing characteristics,  		environmental barriers, and participation in social activities.</p>
<p>The Polio Questionnaire collected additional information about the  		symptoms and impact of the illness at the time of initial diagnosis of polio  		and at various times after the diagnosis.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D can be linked with the core <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> from  		1994 and 1995, which is linked or linkable to several administrative datasets.  		The NHIS-D is linkable by block group and county with air quality data from the  		EPA. It is also linkable at the person level with mortality data from the NDI;  		SSA data, and Medicare enrollment and claims data. In the future NHIS-D files  		will be linkable with information on Medicare Part D and Medicaid enrollment  		and claims, and information on end-stage renal disease from the National  		Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Analytical files will  		also be released with linked <a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> and Medicare data,  		including the beneficiarys reason for Medicare entitlement, total number  		of months of Medicare entitlement, Group Health Plan enrollment, and summarized  		Medicare service charges and reimbursement amounts.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NHIS-D can be used to compare the effect of different definitions of  		disability on program eligibility; to identify unmet needs for transportation  		or other services in geographic areas; and to describe limitations faced,  		services used, and benefits received by those with different diagnoses.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Many of the questions which are asked in the core section of the  		<a href="#NHIS">NHIS</a> or Phase I of the NHIS-D are repeated in Phase II.  		This is intentionally done because responses often differ based on whether they  		are given by the person who is identified as disabled or another person in the  		household.</p>

<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES provides descriptive data on the educational activities of the  		United States population.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES is sponsored by the Institute for Education Sciences, U.S.  		Department of Education.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES samples households who own telephones. A random sample of phone  		numbers is selected from number blocks with one or more known residential  		number(s), based on listings in the white pages. Number blocks with high  		proportions of minorities are oversampled. Sampled households are screened to  		determine their eligibility for the collection of modules comprising the  		survey, which vary by year. For example, modules might require having a  		preschool-aged child or a child in K-12 education, or might oversample adults  		participating in adult education. The survey module sample is then selected  		from those who are eligible, with households selected for one module less  		likely to be chosen for another.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>In 2007 about 62,000 households were screened for eligibility to  		participate in the survey. The school readiness module had a final sample size  		of 2,633, the parent and family involvement in education module a sample size  		of 10,681, and the adult education module a sample size of 7,710.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES can produce estimates for large regions (e.g., East, Midwest,  		North, South, and West) but not for states or smaller regions.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES does not produce longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES has been fielded in 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003,  		2005, and 2007. The survey is composed of several modules, which vary across  		survey years. Information on adult education was collected in 1991, 1995, 1999,  		2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007; information on before and after-school programs in  		1999, 2001, and 2005; information on early childhood program participation in  		1991, 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2005; information on civic involvement in 1996 and  		1999; information on household library use in 1996; information on school  		readiness in 1993, 1999, and 2007; information on school safety and discipline  		in 1993; and information on parent and family involvement in education in 1996,  		2003, and 2007.</p>
<p>The survey is fielded in the spring, and respondents are interviewed  		once.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Disability content in the NHES varies by year, based on which modules  		are fielded, and as modules are updated over time. In 2007 the modules on  		school readiness and parent and family involvement in education collected  		information on whether the child had a speech or language delay; deafness or  		another hearing impairment; blindness or another visual impairment; an  		orthopedic impairment; or another health impairment lasting 6 months or more;  		and if so if they were receiving services for their disability; where services  		were received; if the child had an individualized education plan (IEP); if they  		were currently receiving special education services; how satisfied the  		respondent was with the IEP and special education services; and if the  		childs disability affected their ability to learn. Questions also address  		whether the child has ever been served by an early intervention program or had  		an individual family service plan. These sections also ask whether a doctor has  		expressed concern with the childs weight, and if so if the concern is  		that they are overweight or underweight.</p>
<p>The adult education module contains information on whether the  		respondent has a vision or hearing disability that affects learning; or any  		other long-term physical, mental, or emotional problem that limits them in any  		way.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Disability content in the NHES varies by year, based on which modules  		are fielded, and as modules are updated over time. In 2007 the school readiness  		and parent and family involvement in education modules collected information on  		whether the child had a serious emotional disturbance; or another health  		impairment lasting 6 months or more; and if so if they were receiving services  		for their disability; where services were received; if the child had an IEP; if  		they were currently receiving special education services; how satisfied the  		respondent was with the IEP and special education services; and if the  		childs disability affected their ability to learn. Questions also address  		whether the child has ever been served by an early intervention program or had  		an individual family service plan.</p>
<p>The adult education module contains information on whether the  		respondent has a long-term physical, mental, or emotional problem that limits  		them in any way.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Disability content in the NHES varies by year, based on which modules  		are fielded, and as modules are updated over time. In 2007 the school readiness  		and parent and family involvement in education modules collected information on  		whether the child had a specific learning disability; mental retardation;  		autism; ADD (attention deficit or ADHD); pervasive developmental disorder; or  		another health impairment lasting 6 months or more; and if so if they were  		receiving services for their disability; where services were received; if the  		child had an IEP; if they were currently receiving special education services;  		how satisfied the respondent was with the IEP and special education services;  		and if the childs disability affected their ability to learn. Questions  		also address whether the child has ever been served by an early intervention  		program or had an individual family service plan.</p>
<p>The adult education module contains information on whether the  		respondent has a learning disability, such as dyslexia; ADD, or ADHD; or any  		other long-term physical, mental, or emotional problem that limits them in any  		way.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Since 2003 respondents to all modules have been able to answer that they  		were not working because they were disabled or otherwise unable to work. In  		2007 modules on school readiness and parent and family involvement in education  		also addressed health insurance coverage and the general health status of the  		child.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES covers childrens participation in formal and informal  		nonparental care and education programs; characteristics of care arrangements;  		childrens home literacy activities with family members; school  		adjustment; early school experiences; participation in adult education; parent  		and family involvement in childrens education; before and after-school  		programs and activities; school choice; homeschooling; parent satisfaction with  		childrens schools; school-age children with disabilities; household  		library use; school safety and discipline; and detailed background and  		demographic information.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NHES can be used to compare parent and family participation in  		education between students with certain disabilities and those without; to  		track adult education among adults with disabilities; and to estimate  		participation in early childhood education among children with  		disabilities.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NLTCS" id="NLTCS">NATIONAL LONG TERM CARE SURVEY  		(NLTCS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS is a longitudinal survey designed to study changes in the  		health and functional status of Americans age 65 or older. It also tracks  		health expenditures, Medicare service use, and the availability of personal,  		family, and community resources for caregiving.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS was sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services and Duke University.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS used a nationally representative sample of individuals age 65  		or older, drawn from Medicare eligibility files. Sampled individuals were  		screened-in order to classify them as disabled or nondisabled and to determine  		whether they reside in institutional or community settings. Those living in the  		community who were classified as disabled and about 10 percent of those who  		were not composed the community sample. Those who were living in institutional  		settings composed the institutional sample, and answered fewer questions. More  		information is provided in the Other Notable Features section.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS began in 1982 with a sample of 35,789 individuals. At each  		Wave approximately 5,000 sample members had died since the previous Wave, and  		were replaced by a sample of 5,000 people who had become age 65 since the last  		Wave. Due to budget constraints, not all nondisabled sample members were  		continued into the next Wave. Since the first follow-up survey, approximately  		20,000 sample members were interviewed in each Wave.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS does not support regional or state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS followed disabled and some nondisabled respondents over  		time.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS was first fielded in 1982, with follow-up surveys in 1984,  		1989, 1994, 1999, and 2004. At each Wave some respondents who were categorized  		as nondisabled were eliminated from the sample, and approximately 5,000  		individuals who had reached age 65 since the last Wave were added to the  		sample.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Those screened-in to the community sample were asked if they had  		specific medical conditions (rheumatism or arthritis, paralysis, other  		permanent stiffness or numbness, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,  		Parkinsons disease, glaucoma, diabetes, cancer, frequent constipation,  		frequent trouble sleeping, frequent severe headaches, obesity, or  		atherosclerosis) and whether in the last 12 months they had had a heart attack;  		other heart problem; hypertension; a stroke; circulation trouble in the arms or  		legs; pneumonia; bronchitis; flu; emphysema; asthma; a broken hip; or other  		broken bones.</p>
<p>Both those living in the community and those living in institutional  		settings were asked if in the past week they had needed help to eat; get out of  		bed; get around inside; dress; bathe; or get to and use the toilet. For each  		activity the survey asked if they used special equipment; if someone usually  		stayed nearby in case they needed help, if someone did the activity for them,  		and if any of these were the case how often they were helped, how long they had  		needed help, and how long they had not done the activity.</p>
<p>The survey includes information on whether respondents living in the  		community usually do heavy work around the house; do light work around the  		house; do laundry; prepare meals; shop for groceries; manage money; take  		medicine; make telephone calls; go outside the home; or go beyond walking  		distance; and in each case whether they could do it if necessary and if not if  		this is because of a disability or health problem. Respondents were asked if  		someone had helped them in the past week due to their disability or health  		problem, and if so how long they had helped, who they were, if and how much  		they were paid, and by whom.</p>
<p>Respondents living in the community were asked if they were missing any  		body parts, and if so which one(s); how difficult it was for them to climb a  		flight of stairs; lift 10 pounds; reach above their head, comb or brush their  		hair; bend to put on socks or stockings; wash their hair, use their fingers to  		grasp or handle small objects; whether they could see well enough to read  		ordinary newsprint; if most people could understand their speech; if they could  		usually hear and understand what is said; how their general health was in  		comparison to others of the same age, and how often they avoided doing things  		because they did not have enough energy.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS collected information on whether respondents who were screened  		into the community sample were taking prescription medicines to calm them or  		relieve depression.</p>
<p>These respondents were also asked if they ever felt they need the help  		of a doctor or counselor for a mental or emotional problem; if they had been  		hospitalized for a mental or emotional problem ever or in the past 5 years; if  		they had been advised by a doctor to get help for a mental or emotional problem  		ever or in the past 5 years; if they ever lost their temper and threw, kicked,  		slammed, or destroyed things; how happy they were; and how satisfied they were  		with their life as a whole.</p>
<p>The survey includes information on whether screened-in respondents  		living in the community usually do heavy work around the house; do light work  		around the house; do laundry; prepare meals; shop for groceries; manage money;  		manage their medicine; or make telephone calls; and in each case whether they  		could do it if necessary and if not if this is because of a disability or  		health problem. Respondents were asked if someone had helped them in the past  		week due to their disability or health problem, and if so how long they had  		helped, who they were, if and how much they were paid, and by whom.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Those screened-in to the community sample were asked if they have mental  		retardation, or senility. They were also asked if in the past month they had  		lost their way and not found the way back; took money or something else that  		did not belong to them without realizing it; or forgot to do important  		things.</p>
<p>The survey includes information on whether those screened-in to the  		community sample usually do heavy work around the house; do light work around  		the house; do laundry; prepare meals; shop for groceries; manage money; manage  		their medicine; or make telephone calls; and in each case whether they could do  		it if necessary and if not if this is because of a disability or health  		problem. Respondents were asked if someone had helped them in the past week due  		to their disability or health problem, and if so how long they had helped, who  		they were, if and how much they were paid, and by whom.</p>
<p>The NLTCS administered a set of questions of basic facts to evaluate  		memory and cognitive health. These were asked both of respondents living in  		community and institutional settings.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The screening portion of the NLTCS includes information on whether  		respondents living in community settings have any problem eating without the  		help of another person or special equipment, getting in or out of bed without  		help; getting in or out of chairs without help; walking around inside without  		help; going outside without the help of another person or special equipment;  		dressing without help; bathing without help; getting to the bathroom or using  		the toilet; or any accidents or problems controlling bowel movements or  		urination. If so, respondents were asked if the problem had persisted or was  		expected to persist three month or longer. The survey also includes information  		on whether, without help, respondents are able to prepare meals; do laundry; do  		light housework; shop for groceries; manage money; take medicine; or make  		telephone calls, and if they are unable to do any of these if it because of a  		disability or health problem. All of those identified by these questions as  		disabled, as well as about 10 percent of those who are not, were screened into  		the community sample and answered the remainder of the survey.</p>
<p>The NLTCS asked members of the community sample if they had a disability  		related to service in the armed services and if so what their disability rating  		was. It also asked about receipt of income from Social Security, veterans  		compensation or pension, workers compensation, and SSI.</p>
<p>Members of the community sample were asked if they were covered by  		Medicaid, military health insurance, or private insurance. They were asked if  		they had ever been a patient in a nursing home, convalescent or rest home; or a  		hospital; and in each case if so how many times, when, and for how long. The  		survey also asked if in the past month they had seen a physical therapist;  		occupational therapist; hearing therapist; mental health professional; dentist;  		podiatrist; optometrist; chiropractor; or other doctor, and in each case how  		many times; whether in their home or elsewhere; how much was paid; and who  		paid.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS includes information on active life expectancy, ADLs, aging,  		assistive devices, caregiver income, cognitive functioning, disability trends,  		disease, family support, institutionalization, IADLs, insurance, medical  		providers, Medicare and Medicaid, military service, mortality, paid caregivers,  		unpaid caregivers, and demographics.</p>
<p>Supplemental surveys include a caregiver survey, which acquired data on  		informal caregivers themselves (done in 1982, 1989, 1999, and 2004) and  		next-of-kin surveys administered to the survivors of sample persons who had  		died between 1982 and 1984 and again between 1994 and 1999. In 1999, physical  		specimens were drawn from a sample of respondents.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS can be linked to complete Medicare billing records for each  		person in the sample through an anonymous linking identifier. In addition,  		1991-2004 Medicare Standard Analytic File records for the 49,242 people who  		entered the survey from 1982-2004, 1984-1990 Medicare records for the 30,308  		people who entered the survey from 1982-1989, and 1982-1983 Medicare records  		for the 25,398 people who entered the survey in 1982 and 1984 also are  		available.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS can be used to estimate the prevalence of disability in the  		population of those age 65 and older, and to trace how this changes over time  		for specific age cohorts or across different generations. It can also be used  		to estimate the need for and use of assistance by those experiencing  		limitations, and to compare the financial well-being and social participation  		of those with and without limitations.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTCS used a complex screening pattern. All sample members were  		screened to determine whether they experienced one or more limitations in ADLs  		and IADLs. All respondents who did, and about 10 percent of those who did not,  		moved on to the next level of screening. Information on household composition,  		demographics, and military service was collected. Those who were identified as  		disabled and living in community settings answered all further questions. Those  		who were not identified as disabled but screened-in anyway answered all further  		questions, except for those on activity limitations. Those living in  		institutional settings answered a limited number of questions, as noted above.  		Additional information was also collected on the facility in which these  		respondents lived, including the number of beds and what proportion of beds  		were certified by Medicaid or Medicare.</p>

<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health collects information about respondents social,  		economic, psychological and physical well-being; and families, neighborhoods,  		communities, schools, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships. Its  		purpose is to provide information on how social and behavioral factors  		influence adolescent health over time.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health is a collaborative effort of numerous foundations and federal  		agencies, including the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child  		Health and Human Development, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the MacArthur  		Foundation, the National Cancer Institute, the National Center for Health  		Statistics, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on  		Aging, and other agencies in the U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health uses a sample of adolescents in grades 7-12 drawn from a  		stratified, random sample of high schools in the United States. A school was  		eligible for the sample if it included an 11th grade and had a minimum  		enrollment of 30 students. In some years, separate surveys were also  		administered to individuals school administrators, parents, and romantic  		partners.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health used a sample of 90,118 adolescents and 144 of their school  		administrators in 1994; 20,745 adolescents from the original sample and 17,670  		of their parents in 1995; 14,738 adolescents from the original sample and 128  		of the original 144 school administrators in 1996; 15,197 former adolescents  		from the original sample and 1,507 of their romantic partners in 2001-2002; and  		15,701 former adolescents from the original sample in 2007-2008.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health produces estimates at the national and regional levels (e.g.,  		Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health has followed some individuals from the original sample for 14  		years, from junior high or high school to age 24-32. 20,745 individuals from  		the original sample were targeted for inclusion in the longitudinal sample.  		African American adolescents with a parent with a college degree; Chinese  		adolescents; Cuban and Puerto Rican adolescents; and siblings who live together  		were oversampled.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health has been fielded since 1994 when the first Wave of data  		collection began. Data has been collected in four Waves: Wave I from 1994 to  		1995; Wave II in 1996; Wave III from 2001 to 2002; and Wave IV from 2007 to  		2008.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health includes information about how much respondents health  		limits their ability to do moderate activities, such as moving a table, pushing  		a vacuum cleaner, bowling, or playing golf; and to climb several flights of  		stairs; if each limitation is caused by a condition that has lasted more than a  		year or developed recently; if respondents use a brace, cane, wheelchair or  		other device because of a physical condition; if they have suffered any serious  		injuries in the past 12 months that interfered with their ability to perform  		daily tasks; if they have total blindness in one or both eyes; use of  		eyeglasses, contact lenses, or both; ability to see with corrective lenses; if  		respondents have ever worn a hearing aid; hearing without a hearing aid or  		other assistive devices; if respondents stutter or stammer; how they would  		describe their stuttering or stammering currently; if they have been bothered  		by ringing in the ears that lasts for 5 minutes or more; how long it has  		bothered them; how often it bothers them; if they have had any problem with  		their voices; how often their voices have been hoarse, raspy, or breathy; how  		often they have had difficulty being heard; and how often their voices have  		affected their personal, social, or professional life in the past 12  		months.</p>
<p>Add Health also includes information about height, weight, waist  		measurements, and respondents perceptions of their weight.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health asks if respondents have ever been told by a health care  		provider they have or had depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or  		anxiety or panic disorder; and at what age they were told.</p>
<p>Add Health includes information on how often in the past 30 days  		respondents felt isolated from other people; felt unable to control the  		important things in their lives; were confident in their ability to handle  		their personal problems; felt things were going their way; or were unable to  		overcome their difficulties. It also includes information on how often in the  		past 7 days they were bothered by things that do not usually bother them; were  		unable to shake off the blues; felt they were just as good as other people; had  		trouble concentrating; were depressed; were too tired to do things; felt happy;  		were enjoying life; felt sad; or felt that people disliked them; and what the  		main reason was for these experiences. Questions ask about respondents  		perceptions of their intelligence and attractiveness.</p>
<p>Questions ask if during the past 12 months respondents have seriously  		considered suicide; attempted suicide; and if family or friends have attempted  		suicide.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health asks if respondents have ever been told by a health care  		provider they have or had attention problem, such as ADD; and at what age they  		were told.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health solicits information about general health; how many times a  		day of school or work was missed in the past 30 days due to a health problem;  		date of last menstrual period; date of first menstrual period; times in the  		past 7 days respondents had fast food, sweetened drinks, or diet drinks; the  		time they last ate or drank anything other than water; and if a caffeinated  		beverage was consumed in the past 24 hours and at what time.</p>
<p>Questions ask about current health insurance; reason for not having  		health insurance; time of last routine check-up; where respondents go when  		sick; how many months respondents had health insurance; the number of times  		respondents thought they should get medical care but did not; whether they had  		a health problem that got worse because they did not get care when needed; if  		they had a dental examination; and if the received psychological or emotional  		counseling in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Questions ask if respondents have ever been told by a health care  		provider that they have or had cancer, high blood cholesterol, high blood  		pressure, high blood sugar or diabetes, heart disease, asthma or emphysema,  		migraine headaches, epilepsy or another seizure disorder, HIV/AIDS, or  		hepatitis C; and at what age they were told; if they have had gum disease or  		tooth loss due to cavities, an active infection, an injury, an acute illness,  		surgery, or active seasonal allergies in the past 4 weeks; if they have had  		cold or flu-like symptoms, a fever, night sweats, nausea or vomiting or  		diarrhea, blood in stool or urine, frequent urination, or a skin rash or  		abscess in the past 2 weeks; and if they have taken aspirin-containing  		medications or other anti-inflammatory medications in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Saliva and blood specimens are obtained from consenting respondents, and  		blood pressure and pulse are measured.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Core questions, which are repeated in each Wave, solicit information  		about demographics; relationships with parents; romantic relationships; general  		health; physical limitations; access to health services; households; education;  		employment; income; religion; feelings and mental health; sexually transmitted  		diseases; criminal offenses; and daily activities. </p>

<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health is linked to spatial data obtained from respondents  		addresses allowing the calculation of distances between friends in a school  		community; climate data from the nearest climate station to respondents  		addresses; population density data from the United States <a href="#Census">Census</a>; and weather data from the nearest weather station  		for each Wave I respondent.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>Add Health provides opportunities to study how social environments and  		behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young  		adulthood. Additional biological data collected in later Waves allows  		researchers to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in  		health trajectories as adolescents become adults.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The survey instrument has been updated for each Wave. Waves I and II  		focus on environmental factors that may influence adolescents health and  		risk behaviors, including personal traits, families, friendships, romantic  		relationships, peer groups, schools, neighborhoods, and communities. Wave III  		focuses on how adolescent experiences and behaviors are related to decisions,  		lifestyle, achievement, and health outcomes in the transition to adulthood.  		Wave IV questions ask about pregnancy, marriage, children, and parenting.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NLSY97" id="NLSY97">NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL SURVEY OF YOUTH  		1997 (NLSY97)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 uses a nationally representative sample of approximately  		9,000 youths who were 12-16 years old as of December 31, 1996. The NLSY97 is  		designed to document the transition from school to work and into adulthood. It  		collects extensive information about youths' labor market behavior and  		educational experiences over time.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S.  		Department of Labor.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 sampled of United States residents in 1997. Black and  		Hispanic households were oversampled. All members of sampled households who had  		been born between 1980 and 1984 were selected. Youth who usually resided in a  		sampled household but were away at school or college, as well as those in a  		hospital, correctional facility, or other type of institution were included in  		the sample. Both parents and youths in the appropriate age group were  		interviewed in 1997. In subsequent years, only the youth sample members were  		interviewed.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 began with a sample of 8,984 respondents in 6,819 unique  		households. A total of 7,756 individuals were included in the 2003-2004  		interviews.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 does not support estimates at the regional or state level.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 follows youth from age 12-16 into adulthood.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 was first fielded in 1997-1998, and has been administered  		each year.</p>
<p>A similar survey, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979  		(NLSY79) was first administered in 1979 to youth who were 14-22 years old at  		the time. They were interviewed annually through 1994, and are now interviewed  		every two years.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 asked parents if the youth regularly took any medicines; had  		trouble seeing, hearing, or speaking; had part of their body that was or had  		been deformed or missing; or had another chronic or life-threatening disease  		(e.g., asthma, heart condition, anemia, diabetes, cancer, epilepsy).</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>In the first round of the survey a parent was asked how often the youth  		had trouble sleeping; was unhappy, sad, or depressed; could not concentrate or  		pay attention for long; or did not get along with other kids. In all surveys  		the youth is asked this set of questions, as well as to whom they would turn if  		they had an emotional or personal relationship problem. They are also asked if  		they usually expect things to turn out for the best; rarely count on good  		things happening; are always optimistic about their future; or hardly ever  		expect things to go their way.</p>
<p>The NLSY97 asked parents if the youth currently had or had previously  		had any physical, emotional, or mental condition that limited their ability to  		attend school regularly, do regular schoolwork, or work at a job for pay; if  		the youth regularly took any medicines; and if they had or had previously had a  		learning or emotional problem that limited the kind or amount of schoolwork or  		other daily activities they could perform.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 asked parents if the youth currently had or had previously  		had a learning or emotional problem that limited the kind or amount of  		schoolwork or other daily activities they could perform.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>In the first round of the NLSY97 parents were asked about the  		youths general health; if the youth currently had or had previously had  		any physical, emotional, or mental condition that limited their ability to  		attend school regularly, do regular schoolwork, or work at a job for pay; and  		if the youth was covered by health insurance and what kind. Youth report on  		their own general health in all rounds, as well as their height and weight. In  		the first round youth living independently of their parents were asked about  		their own health insurance coverage; in subsequent rounds all youth report on  		their health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>If not working, youth can answer that they are disabled and unable to  		work. They are then asked if the disability prevents them from doing any kind  		or work for the next 6 months, and in subsequent years are asked if they are  		still unable to work because of a disability.</p>
<p>The NLSY97 asks if respondents have attended training, including  		vocational rehabilitation, and if so how much they paid; if they received a  		training allowance for attending; whether they completed the program; whether  		they received any certification or license; and activities in the program.</p>
<p>Youth are asked if they have received payments from workers  		compensation or SSI, and for each when the payments began; when the payments  		ended; who in their household qualified for the payments; and how much the  		payments were.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 collects information on employment; schooling; training;  		income, assets, and program participation; family formation; family background;  		expectations; attitudes, behaviors, and time use; health; environmental  		variables; and the timing of major life events.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 is linked to the high school transcripts of sample  		members.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NLSY97 can be used to track the educational and employment outcomes  		of those with and without disabilities over time; to describe the attitudes and  		expectations of youth with disabilities and their parents; and to compare  		profiles of youth with disabilities to similar youth in the NLSY79.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>In the fall of 1996, all public and private schools that had a 12th  		grade and that were located in one of the NLSY97 primary sampling units  		received school survey questionnaires. Over the summer and fall of 1997 and the  		winter of 1998, NLSY97 respondents took the computer adaptive version of the  		Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NLTS2" id="NLTS2">NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL TRANSITION STUDY 2  		(NLTS2)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 collected information on a national sample of students who  		were 13-16 years of age in 2000 as they moved from secondary school into adult  		roles. The study aimed to describe the characteristics of secondary school  		students receiving special education and their households; describe the  		secondary school experiences of students in special education; describe the  		experiences of students once they leave secondary school; measure the secondary  		school and post-school outcomes of students in the education, employment,  		social, and residential domains; and identify factors in students' secondary  		school and post-school experiences that contribute to positive outcomes.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 was funded by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S.  		Department of Education.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 randomly selected school districts on the basis of their  		geographic region, size, and socioeconomic status. These school districts were  		contacted and invited to participate in the study. For each district that  		agreed to participate, NLTS2 asked for the district's list of special education  		students along with each student's grade, date of birth, and disability  		classification. Approximately 12,000 students were randomly selected to  		participate in NLTS2 based on the student's age and disability  		classification.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 used a sample of approximately 12,000 youth.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 does not produce regional or state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 followed youth from 2000 to 2009.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 administered parent interviews in 2000-2001 and both parent  		and youth interviews in 2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2006-2007, and 2008-2009. Direct  		assessment, a teacher survey, and a school program survey were collected in  		2001-2002 and 2003-2004. A school characteristics survey was conducted in  		2001-2002.</p>
<p>The NLTS2 was a follow-up to the original NLTS, which was conducted from  		1985 through 1993.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 includes information on what physical, sensory, learning, or  		other disabilities or problems the youth has been diagnosed with; which is  		their main problem or disability; for what disability or disabilities they  		receive special help at school; at what age the youth had their first  		disability or condition; and whether it was a professional or family member who  		first noticed.</p>
<p>If the youth had a vision problem, the survey asked if the youth wore  		glasses or contacts and how well they saw with and without them; if the youth  		used Braille, a portable Braille note taker or writer; large print type;  		optical devices; mobility devices; assistive technology; or other devices to  		see or read. If the youth had a hearing problem the survey asked how well they  		heard without a hearing aid; if they used a hearing aid; and if so how they  		heard with it; if they had a cochlear implant; how well the youth communicated;  		and if the youth used sign language or manual communication; lip reading; cued  		speech; oral speech; a communication board or book; or anything else to help  		them communicate. If the youth used oral speech the survey asked how clearly  		they spoke and how well they carried on conversation. If the youth used sign  		language the survey asked which language was used and whether members of the  		household used manual sign language or manual communication. If the youth had a  		speech impairment the survey asked how well the youth communicates and whether  		they used words; sounds that are not words; gestures; sign language; a  		communication board or book; a computer; or any other method of communicating.  		The survey asked how well the youth used their arms and hands to handle things;  		how well they used their arms and hands for lifting, throwing, and carrying;  		how well they used their legs and feet; and if they used equipment to get  		around.</p>
<p>The survey asked how well youth could dress themselves; feed themselves;  		tell time on a clock with hands; read and understand common signs; count  		change; look up telephone numbers and use the telephone; and get to places  		outside the home. It collected information on how often in the past month a  		health or emotional problem had caused the youth to miss a social or  		recreational activity; how often they missed school due to a health or  		emotional problem; whether they were taking prescription medicine for a  		condition or problem related to their disability or special need; and if so  		which medicine.</p>
<p>The survey asked whether in the past 12 months youth had received speech  		or language therapy, or communication services; audiology services; physical  		therapy; occupational therapy or mobility services; medical services for  		diagnosis or evaluation related to their special needs; a personal assistant or  		in-the-home or in-the-classroom aide; a reader or interpreter; nursing care;  		assistive technology services or devices; respite care; or career counseling;  		and in each case if it was through the school or district.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 collected information on what physical, sensory, learning, or  		other disabilities or problems the youth had been diagnosed with; if they had  		ADD or ADHD; which was their main problem or disability; for what disability or  		disabilities they received special help at school; at what age the youth had  		their first disability or condition; and whether it was a professional or  		family member who first noticed. The NLTS2 asked whether youth were taking  		prescription medicine that controls attention or changes mood; and which  		medicine.</p>
<p>The survey asked youth how often in the past week they had enjoyed life;  		felt depressed; felt that people disliked them; were hopeful about the future;  		or felt lonely; how often they got together with friends outside of school and  		organized activities; how often they were invited by friends to social  		activities at their homes or parties; and how often youth were called on the  		phone by their friends. It asked parents how often youth joined group  		activities without being told to; made friends easily; ended disagreements with  		the respondent calmly; seemed confident in social situations; got into  		situations that were likely to result in trouble; started conversations rather  		than waiting for someone else to initiate conversation; received criticism  		well; behaved at home in a way that caused problems for the family; controlled  		their temper when arguing with peers; kept working at something until it was  		finished; and spoke in an appropriate tone at home.</p>
<p>The NLTS2 collected information on how often in the past month a health  		or emotional problem had caused the youth to miss a social or recreational  		activity; how often they had missed school due to a health or emotional  		problem; whether they were taking prescription medicine for a condition or  		problem related to their disability or special need; whether they were taking  		precipitation medicine that controls attention or changes mood; and if so which  		medicine.</p>
<p>The survey asked whether in the past 12 months youth had received  		psychological or mental health services or counseling; social work services;  		medical services for diagnosis or evaluation related to their special needs;  		respite care; or career counseling; and in each case if it was through the  		school or district.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 collected information on what physical, sensory, learning, or  		other disabilities or problems the youth had been diagnosed with; which was  		their main problem or disability; for what disability or disabilities they  		received special help at school; at what age the youth had their first  		disability or condition; and whether it was a professional or family member who  		first noticed.</p>
<p>The survey asked how well youth could dress themselves; feed themselves;  		tell time on a clock with hands; read and understand common signs; count  		change; look up telephone numbers and use the telephone; and get to places  		outside the home.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 asked at what age youth started getting special services; if  		the youth received early intervention services; if they had an individualized  		education program (IEP) or received special education services between the ages  		of 3 and 5; and what kind of school the youth attended. The survey asked about  		the youths general health; if the youth used medical equipment such as an  		oxygen tank or catheter; and if so what.</p>
<p>The survey asked whether the youth was covered by private insurance;  		government assisted or public health insurance; or another source of insurance;  		if their coverage was with a health maintenance organization (HMO); whether  		their coverage was managed care; and whether their insurance covered dental  		care; vision care; medicines and prescriptions; or mental health care; if the  		respondent had needed to change plans or buy extra insurance for the youth  		because of their special needs; and whether they had ever tried to get  		insurance to pay for a service that was refused and if so what that service  		was.</p>
<p>The NLTS2 also asked how the youth usually got to their job if they had  		one. If youth were not working or looking for work respondents were asked why,  		and could respond that they would lose benefits such as SSI. It asked if the  		household had received SSI for the youth in the past 2 years; if it still did,  		and if not why the benefits stopped.</p>
<p>Youth were asked whether they considered themselves to have a disability  		or special need; whether they thought they knew what services they needed;  		whether they got services; how often they told professionals what they thought  		about the services they received; how difficult it was for them to get where  		they wanted to go; their attitudes toward school; whether they had an IEP;  		whether they were involved in planning their IEP; and how they felt about their  		IEP and their part in making decisions in it.</p>
<p>The survey asked youth what services, accommodations, and supports they  		received at school; how useful these had been; and whether they had received  		enough to do their best. These questions were asked for high school, as well as  		any postsecondary vocational, business, or technical schools or 4-year colleges  		or universities attended. Respondents reported whether their employer was aware  		of their learning problem, disability, or special need; what accommodations, if  		any, they received; and how they usually got to work.</p>
<p>A survey completed by the school personnel gathered information on the  		settings in which youth learned; whether they took standardized assessments; if  		they used testing accommodations, and if so which. If the student had a visual  		impairment the survey asked how well they used different methods to find their  		way around. The school program also reported on the students  		disabilities, and which one was primary; and services provided through the  		school system.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 collected information on diagnoses and limitations; services  		used; parent and youth attitudes and expectations; school characteristics;  		family income; program participation; educational experience; work experience;  		health insurance; and demographics.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 is linked to the school transcripts from every year the youth  		was in high school.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NLTS2 can be used to estimate the usage and need for services and  		supports among youth with disabilities; to track changes in expectations as  		youth with disabilities age into adulthood; and to compare educational and  		employment outcomes of youth in special education in 2000 to those 15 years  		earlier.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NNHS" id="NNHS">NATIONAL NURSING HOME SURVEY  		(NNHS)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS is a continuing series of national sample surveys of nursing  		homes, their residents, and their staff. Although each of these surveys has  		emphasized different topics, they all provide some common basic information.  		The NNHS provides information on nursing homes from two perspectives -- that of  		the provider of services and that of the recipient of care.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS is sponsored by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control,  		U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A supplemental survey of nursing  		assistants employed by nursing homes, the National Nursing Assistant Survey,  		was sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS sample represents United States nursing homes and their  		residents, and is drawn using astratified two-stage probability design. Nursing  		homes are selected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Provider  		of Services file of United States nursing homes and state licensing lists  		compiled by a private organization. The likelihood of a facility being selected  		is proportional to the number of beds. Up to 12 individuals are selected from  		the population of residents on the register of the sampled facility, including  		those who are physically absent from the facility due to overnight leave or a  		hospital visit but have a bed maintained for them at the facility. In all  		cases, information on individuals is provided by staff members familiar with  		the residents and their care, not by the nursing home residents.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>In 2004 the NNHS used a sample of 1,174 nursing homes and 14,017  		residents from the responding facilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS supports estimates for geographical regions.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS does not produce longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS was first conducted in 1973-1974 and has been repeated in 1977,  		1985, 1995, 1997, 1999, and most recently in 2004. The 2004 version reflected a  		re-design of the survey and collected information on an expanded set of  		variables.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS collects information on how independent individuals are in bed  		mobility; transfer; walking in their room; walking in the corridor; locomotion  		on and off their unit; dressing; eating; using the toilet; doing personal  		hygiene; and bathing.</p>
<p>The NNHS also collects information on weight loss and gain; falls and  		fractures; pressure ulcers; current and most intense pain levels; how pain is  		managed; symptoms experienced (difficulty with coughing and secretions,  		shortness of breath, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, fecal impaction, nausea  		or vomiting, change in sleep patterns, restlessness, urinary retention, fever,  		impaired endurance, offensive odor, open lesions or infections of the mouth,  		and pruitis or itching), and treatments used.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS asks if individuals have indicators of depressed, sad, or  		anxious mood that are not easily altered by attempts to cheer up,  		console, or reassure them; or display any behavioral symptoms such as  		wandering, verbally abusive language, physically abusive actions, socially  		inappropriate or disruptive behavior, or resisting care.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS asks how independently individuals make decisions regarding  		tasks of daily life; and if they display any behavioral symptoms such as  		wandering, verbally abusive language, physically abusive actions, socially  		inappropriate or disruptive behavior, or resisting care.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS collects information on the use of side rails or restraints. It  		also asks about participation in special programs for hospice, palliative, or  		end of life care; pain management; behavioral problems; skin problems or  		wounds; continence management; dementia; and restorative care. Information is  		collected on the individuals primary diagnosis when admitted and at the  		time of interview, as well as current secondary diagnoses; visits to the  		emergency room and hospital admissions in the past 90 days; and vaccination  		status. The survey also acquires a list of medications used by the individual.  		Information is also collected on sources of payment, total charges, and the  		amount the individuals family is expected to pay.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS collects information on characteristics of the nursing home;  		demographics; length of stay; symptoms experienced; treatments received;  		diagnoses; sources of payment; medications used; and ADLs.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS is liked with mortality data from the NDI, SSA data, and  		Medicaid enrollment and claims data (2004 NNHS only). In the future, NNHS files  		from 2004 will be linked with information on Medicare Part D and information on  		end-stage renal disease from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive  		and Kidney Diseases. Analytical files will also be released with linked NNHS  		and Medicare data, including the beneficiarys reason for Medicare  		entitlement, total number of months of Medicare entitlement, Group Health Plan  		enrollment, and summarized Medicare service charges and reimbursement  		amounts.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NNHS can use used to examine trends in costs incurred by nursing  		home residents over time; to estimate differences in the needs of those who  		enter nursing homes with different diagnoses; and to understand the challenges  		of moving nursing home residents into community settings.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>In 2004 the NNHS also collected information about the employees of  		sampled nursing homes.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NS-CSHCN" id="NS-CSHCN">NATIONAL SURVEY OF CHILDREN WITH  		SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS (NS-CSHCN)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the NS-CSHCN is to provide information on childrens  		special health care needs in the United States and childrens and their  		families access to and satisfaction with care.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN is sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the  		Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and  		Human Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN uses a sample representative of the United States  		population of children under 18 years of age living in households. The sample  		was randomly selected using the State and Local Area Integrated Telephone  		Survey mechanism. Interviews were conducted with parents or guardians of  		children selected into the sample.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The 2000 survey used a sample of 364,841 children, and the 2005 survey  		used a sample of 372,174 children.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN supports estimates at the state level.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN does not follow individuals longitudinally.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN was first fielded from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2005 to  		2006. Each respondent is interviewed once.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN includes information on whether children need or use  		medicine prescribed by a doctor; need or use medical care, mental health, or  		educational services more than is usual for most children of the same age; are  		limited or prevented in any way in their ability to do things most children of  		the same age can do; or need or get special therapy, such as physical,  		occupational, or speech; and in each case if it is because of a medical,  		behavioral, or other health condition; if the condition has lasted or is  		expected to last 12 months or longer; and if the need, use, or limitation has  		lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. If respondents answer that  		children have any of these special needs or limitations and that the problem  		has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more, children are classified as  		special needs and are asked more questions than children without special needs.  		The survey includes information on how often during the past 12 months medical,  		behavioral, or other health conditions have affected the ability of children  		identified as having special needs to do things other children of the same age  		do; how much these conditions affect childrens ability; and how often  		childrens health care needs change.</p>
<p>The NS-CSHCN includes information on whether children experience  		difficulty with seeing; hearing; breathing; swallowing, digesting food, or  		metabolism; blood circulation; repeated or chronic physical pain; taking care  		of themselves; coordination or moving around; using their hands; and speaking,  		communicating, or being understood; and the severity of these difficulties. If  		the child does not experience these difficulties the survey includes  		information on whether that is because their health problems are being treated,  		and the specific reason their health problems do not currently cause them  		difficulty.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NSFH" id="NSFH">NATIONAL SURVEY OF FAMILIES AND  		HOUSEHOLDS (NSFH)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH was designed to provide a broad range of information on family  		life to serve as a resource for research across disciplinary perspectives. The  		design permits the detailed description of past and current living arrangements  		and other characteristics and experiences, as well as the analysis of  		consequences of earlier patterns on current states, marital and parenting  		relationships, kin contact, and economic and psychological well-being.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The first Wave of the NSFH was sponsored by the National Institute of  		Child Health and Human Development, U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services. The second and third Waves were jointly sponsored by the National  		Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute on  		Aging, both of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH used a multistage probability sample of those age 19 and older  		living in households. Students away at college and those living in military  		housing but tied to a sampled household were eligible for interview. Minority  		groups, single parent families, families with step children, cohabitors, and  		recently married couples were oversampled. Within each sampled household one  		person 19 years old or older was randomly selected as the primary respondent.  		Information was gathered from the primary respondent, their spouse or partner,  		and the householder if he or she is not already accounted for. In the first  		follow-up year information was collected from the primary respondent, their  		spouse or partner, their spouse or partner at the time of the first survey if  		different, and a focal child who was living in the household at the time of the  		first survey. In the second follow-up year information was gathered from the  		primary respondent, their spouse or partner at the time of the first survey,  		and a focal child.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The first Wave of the NSFH used a sample of 13,007 households.  		Interviews were conducted with 10,007 primary respondents in the second Wave,  		as well as 12,067 other family members. A total of 10,154 interviews were  		conducted in the third Wave.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH does not support regional or state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>If respondents reported that a member of the household, or anyone who  		had been a member in the past 12 months, needed assistance or care because of a  		disability or chronic illness, they were asked if the individual had difficulty  		climbing stairs; caring for personal needs such as dressing, eating, or  		toileting; or moving around inside the house.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH contains information on whether children have seen a therapist  		or doctor for emotional or behavioral problems.</p>
<p>It also includes information on how often respondents felt bothered by  		things that did not usually bother them; not felt like eating; felt they could  		not shake off the blues even with help from family and friends; had trouble  		keeping their mind on what they were doing; felt depressed; felt that  		everything was an effort; felt fearful; slept restlessly; talked less than  		usual; felt lonely; felt sad; or felt like they could not get going. Questions  		also addressed whether anyone in the household had problems with drug or  		alcohol abuse.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>If respondents reported that a member of the household, or anyone who  		had been a member in the past 12 months, needed assistance or care because of a  		disability or chronic illness, they were asked if the individual had difficulty  		caring for personal needs such as dressing, eating, or toileting..</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH contains information on the reasons individuals joined or left  		the responding household, including because the individual needed care or  		assistance due to a disability or chronic illness; moving in or out of a  		nursing facility; and receiving nursing care at home. Respondents were also  		asked if any member of the household, or anyone who had been a member in the  		past 12 months, needed assistance or care because of a disability or chronic  		illness, and if so their age; condition; relationship to the respondent; when  		they began to need assistance or care; whether they could be left alone and for  		how long; and whether they had difficulty working (asked of those age 16 or  		older); driving a car (asked of those age 16 or older); or doing household  		tasks (asked of those age 16 or older).</p>
<p>The NSFH includes information on how satisfied respondents were with  		their health and how it compared with the health of others of their age, as  		well as sources of income including SSI, SSDI, private disability, and  		workers compensation. Questions in follow-up surveys addressed health  		insurance coverage.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH collected information on household composition; the  		respondents household composition while growing up; marriage history;  		cohabitation history; children in the household; income; assistance and care  		provided to those in and out of the household; attitudes and opinions;  		residential mobility; employment history; childcare arrangements; income and  		assets; dynamics within the household including financial dynamics, household  		responsibilities, and how different members of the household interact; and  		detailed background and demographic information.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NSFH can be used to describe the dynamics of families in which one  		or more individuals has a disability which requires care or assistance; to  		track changes in household composition over time; and to examine the changes  		which occur in a family when a member experiences the onset of a  		disability.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NSCF" id="NSCF">NATIONAL SURVEY OF SSI CHILDREN AND  		FAMILIES (NSCF)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF collected data on the health status; functional limitations;  		health care utilization; health insurance coverage; receipt of special  		education, transportation, and other services; household socioeconomic status;  		and housing characteristics of over 3,000 children who were receiving, had  		received, or were applying for SSI.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF was sponsored by the U.S. Social Security Administration.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF used a sample drawn from the SSAs administrative records  		of SSI applicants and recipients. The study was limited to the  		noninstitutionalized population in the continental United States (residents of  		Alaska, Hawaii and the territories were not included in the survey).  		Information was gathered from a parent or guardian, or the beneficiary if they  		were age 18 or older, and included data on both the beneficiary and other  		members of the family.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF used a sample size of 3,203 children and young adults receiving  		SSI benefits and their families.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF does not support regional or state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF does not provide longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF was conducted once, from 2001 to 2002.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF gathered information on whether the child who received SSI:  		needed or used more medical care, mental health, or education services than  		most children; if the child needed or used medicine prescribed by a doctor; was  		limited or prevented in any way in their ability to do things children of the  		same age can do; needed or got special therapy; and if so if it was because of  		a medical, behavioral or other health condition, and if it had lasted or was  		expected to last 12 months or longer.</p>
<p>If the child had a current health condition or problem the survey  		collected information on whether they used any medical devices such as a  		glucose monitor or wheelchair; how well they heard without a hearing aid;  		whether they experienced any difficulty seeing even with glasses or contact  		lenses; whether they needed help with personal care, and if so what activities  		required assistance (age 5 or older). Questions also addressed how many times  		in the previous 12 months they had seen a doctor or other medical professional;  		stayed overnight or longer in a hospital; been to a hospital emergency room;  		had surgery, and how much was paid by the family for physical health care for  		the child. Questions also asked whether they had delayed or gone without health  		care, dental care, or medication, and if so why.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF gathered information on whether the child who received SSI:  		needed or used more medical care, mental health, or education services than  		most children; needed or used medicine prescribed by a doctor; was limited or  		prevented in any way in their ability to do things children of the same age can  		do; needed or got special therapy; and if so if it was because of a medical,  		behavioral or other health condition, and if it had lasted or was expected to  		last 12 months or longer.</p>
<p>The survey also asked if the child needed or got treatment or counseling  		for any kind of emotional or behavioral problem; and if so if the condition had  		lasted or was expected to last 12 months or longer; and if they were limited in  		any way in any activities due to that condition.</p>
<p>The survey also collected information on whether they had stayed  		overnight to receive treatment for mental health or substance abuse in the past  		12 months, and if so whether for mental health or substance abuse, and how many  		times; if they had received outpatient treatment for mental health or substance  		abuse, and if so whether for mental health or substance abuse, how many times,  		and how much treatment cost the family.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF gathered information on whether the child who received SSI:  		needed or used more medical care, mental health, or education services than  		most children; if the child needed or used medicine prescribed by a doctor; was  		limited or prevented in any way in their ability to do things children of the  		same age can do; needed or got special therapy; and if so if it was because of  		a medical, behavioral or other health condition, and if it had lasted or was  		expected to last 12 months or longer.</p>
<p>If the child had a current health condition or problem the survey  		collected information on whether they used any medical devices; whether they  		needed help with personal care, and if so what activities required assistance  		(age 5 or older).</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF asked whether a medical, behavioral, or health condition  		currently prevented recipients age 17 or older from working at a job or  		business or attending school; or limited the kind or amount or work or school  		they could participate in.</p>
<p>Questions also collected information on whether the child was covered by  		health insurance; the kind of coverage (for example, Medicaid, private  		insurance from an employer); who paid for coverage; whether the individual was  		ever without health insurance coverage in the previous 12 months, and if so for  		how long; if the respondent had tried to get their insurance to pay for  		something for the child but the insurer had refused to pay, and if so what for;  		whether the respondent had tried to get private insurance but been unable to,  		and if so why.</p>
<p>The survey collected information on whether school-age children were not  		going to school due to illness or disability; if they received special  		education services, and if so where and whether in a regular classroom,  		resource room, or separate classroom. If the child did not receive special  		education services the survey asked if the respondent had tried to get services  		for them, and if they were on a waiting list. The survey collected information  		on whether children under age 3 were receiving early intervention services and  		if so where, and if not whether the respondent had tried to get services for  		them and if they were on a waiting list. The survey collected information on  		whether recipients age 14 or older had received any training in job skills,  		vocational education, or help finding a job; and if so what kind, where from,  		and how much; and if they were then receiving training. If the SSI recipient  		had not received training the survey asked if the respondent had tried to get  		training for them, and if they were on a waiting list. Questions also asked how  		likely the child was to attend school or training after they turn age 18, and  		how likely they were to live independently. Recipients age 17 or older were  		asked if they had ever been referred to vocational rehabilitation services by  		SSA, and if so if they were accepted.</p>
<p>If the child had a current health condition or problem the survey  		collected information on how often and to what degree they were limited; how  		severe the problem was; how often their health needs changed; what their main  		condition was; how long they had had this health condition; how many days of  		work or school were missed in the previous 12 months because of illness or  		injury (age 17 or older); how many days they had been kept in bed more than  		half the day due to illness or injury (age 17 or older); whether they needed  		help with routine tasks such as preparing meals and managing money and if so  		what tasks (age 17 or older); whether family members provided any health care  		at home, and if so how much time they spent on it and how they were related;  		whether they received health care from others, and if so how much the family  		paid for it.</p>
<p>The survey also asked if they had an individual education plan or an  		individual written rehabilitation plan.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF covered disability status and functional limitations; health  		care utilization; health insurance; education and training; other programs and  		services; impact on family; SSI experience; employment; work and childcare;  		unearned income and assets; housing and transportation; and background  		information.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF allows researchers to estimate the number of children receiving  		SSI who are not receiving needed services; to examine the family dynamics of  		children receiving SSI; or to understand the use of other programs by families  		receiving SSI benefits for a childs disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The NSCF sample includes children and young adults receiving SSI, as  		well as those who received SSI benefits in the past.</p>
<p>It is sometimes referred to as SSI-Kids.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="NSV" id="NSV">NATIONAL SURVEY OF VETERANS (NSV)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV provides information for developing and planning VA programs.  		The survey collects information from both active and veteran service members  		and their families.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The 2001 NSV used a nationally representative sample of  		noninstitutionalized veterans. Eligible respondents were identified through  		telephone screening interviews conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico.  		The sample was augmented by a random sample of veterans selected from the VA  		Compensation and Pension records and VA Health Care Enrollment files.</p>
<p>The 2009 NSV included military family members as a part of the sample  		for the first time in the history of the survey. Family members were surveyed  		along with active and veteran service members. Data, questionnaire, and final  		report for the 2009 NSV are not yet available.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The 2001 NSV interviewed 20,048 respondents.</p>
<p>130,000 screening surveys were mailed to households for the 2009 NSV to  		identify eligible respondents. 10,000 veterans are expected to participate in  		the 2009 NSV. Data, questionnaire, and final report are not yet available for  		the 2009 NSV.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV does not support regional or state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV does not collect longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV has been fielded six times in 1978, 1979, 1987, 1993, 2001, and  		2009.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The 2001 NSV collected information about any medical treatment over the  		previous year for specific physical, mental, and emotional conditions including  		eye or vision problems, a hearing condition that requires a hearing aid,  		cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The 2001 NSV collected information about difficulties in the last week  		with ADLs including eating, using or getting to the toilet, bathing or  		showering, getting dressed, controlling bladder or bowels, walking across a  		room, and getting in or out of chairs or bed. The survey also collected  		information about difficulties during the previous week with IADLs including  		preparing meals, managing money, using the telephone, doing light housework,  		shopping for personal items, shopping for groceries, or going places within or  		out of walking distance.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The 2001 NSV collected information about any medical treatment over the  		previous year for specific physical, mental, and emotional conditions,  		including post-traumatic stress disorder and drug abuse or alcoholism.</p>
<p>The 2001 NSV collected information about difficulties in the previous  		week with IADLs including preparing meals, managing money, using the telephone,  		doing light housework, shopping for personal items, shopping for groceries, or  		going places within or out of walking distance.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The 2001 NSV collected information about difficulties in the previous  		week with ADLs including eating, using or getting to the toilet, bathing or  		showering, getting dressed, controlling bladder or bowels, walking across a  		room, and getting in or out of chairs or bed. The survey also collected  		information about difficulties during the previous week with IADLs including  		preparing meals, managing money, using the telephone, doing light housework,  		shopping for personal items, shopping for groceries, or going places within or  		out of walking distance.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>All respondents were asked if they currently had a disability and for  		their VA disability rating on the 2001 NSV. If the respondent indicated a  		disability, the respondent was asked whether the disability was related to  		military service. Respondents were asked whether they had worked or were  		looking for work in the week prior to the survey. If the respondent did not  		work or look for work they respondent could select that this was due to a  		disability.</p>
<p>The 2001 NSV asked if respondents were covered by Medicare; Medicare  		managed care; an HMO; Medigap or Medicare supplemental health insurance;  		Medicaid; CHAMPUS; TRICARE; another government health care program; or private  		health insurance.</p>
<p>The survey asked all respondents to rate their health status from  		excellent to poor. The survey also collected information about health care  		service usage during the previous year, including emergency room visits,  		outpatient care, inpatient care, prescriptions, treatment for environmental  		hazards, psychiatric treatment or counseling, in-home health care, and  		prostheses. If the respondent indicated using any services during the past  		year, the survey collected information about how the respondent paid for  		services and if the VA provided care.</p>
<p>Respondents who did not utilize VA benefits in the last year for health  		care services were asked for reasons why VA benefits were not used. They could  		respond that they used other sources for health care, that using VA benefits  		was inconvenient, that they were not aware of VA health benefits, or that they  		had concerns about quality of care compared to other sources.</p>
<p>The 2001 NSV included sections focusing on VA disability compensation  		and pension and vocational rehabilitation and employment services. The survey  		collected information about program participation, reasons for not applying,  		ease of receiving benefits, the importance of programs to respondents, and  		knowledge of the programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics on the 2001 NSV included military service experience, health  		status, health insurance coverage, VA disability compensation and pension  		program, educational programs, vocational rehabilitation and employment  		services, home loan guaranty program, life insurance program, and burial  		plans.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV surveys can be used to evaluate the prevalence of  		service-related disabilities and compare the health status of veterans with and  		without disabilities. It can be used to model service usage and to explore the  		reasons why people do not utilize VA health benefits. The information in the  		survey can be used to model the impact of changes in VA policy on services for  		people with disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The NSV is conducted infrequently. The most recent NSV was fielded in  		2009.</p>

<p>The NSDUH samples the civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 12  		years or older residing within the United States, including those living in  		group quarters but not those without a fixed household address. Up to two  		members of each sampled household unit are selected to complete the interview,  		with those ages 12-25 oversampled.<sup><a href="#note20">20</a></sup> The  		sampling algorithm is updated approximately every 5 years.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH samples approximately 86,000 individuals each year.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH produces representative estimates for the 50 states and the  		District of Columbia.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH does not produce longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH was first conducted in 1972, and has been fielded annually  		since 1991. Interviews are evenly spread throughout the year. Each respondent  		is interviewed once.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH does not include information specific to physical  		disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>A section given only to adults includes information on whether the  		respondent has stayed overnight or longer for treatment or counseling for  		problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health; the kind of facility at which  		it occurred; who paid; how much was paid; if the respondent has received  		outpatient treatment or counseling; where that occurred; who paid; how much was  		paid; use of prescription medicine; if treatment was ever needed but not  		obtained, and if so why; and whether the respondent has received treatment from  		other sources (herbalist, acupuncturist, chiropractor, spiritual or religious  		advisor, Internet support or chat room, in-person support group, or  		hotline).</p>
<p>A similar section given only to adolescents includes information on  		whether, due to emotional or behavioral problems not caused by alcohol or  		drugs, the respondent has stayed overnight or longer in a hospital, residential  		treatment center, or foster care; visited a partial day hospital or day  		treatment program, mental health clinic or center, private therapist,  		psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, counselor, pediatrician or other  		family doctor; or been visited by an in-home therapist, counselor, or family  		preservation worker; and in each case why they did so. Respondents are also  		asked whether treatment has been received in school or in prison.</p>
<p>The survey also contains a section on mental health, which includes  		information on how often the respondent feels nervous; hopeless; restless or  		fidgety; so sad or depressed that nothing could cheer them up; that everything  		is an effort; or down on their self, no good, or worthless. It also contains  		information on whether and to what extent they have had difficulty  		concentrating; difficulty going out of the house or getting around on their  		own; difficulty dealing with people they did not know well; difficulty  		participating in social activities; difficulty taking care of household  		responsibilities; difficulty taking care of responsibilities at work or school;  		or difficulty getting work done as quickly as needed; and whether they were  		able to do these things at all during the month in the past year in which their  		symptoms were worst. Questions also address whether the respondent contemplated  		or attempted suicide, and whether they received medical attention as a  		result.</p>
<p>The NSDUH also contains a section on depression, which includes  		information on whether the respondent has, most of the day for a period of  		several days or longer, most of the day for two weeks or more, or most of the  		day every day, felt sad, empty or depressed; felt discouraged or hopeless; or  		lost interest or became bored with activities that are normally enjoyable; and  		if so whether during any of these periods the respondent also experienced any  		of these other depression symptoms; how severe and long lasting each feeling  		was during those periods; if the respondent was unable to carry out daily  		activities as a result or experienced changes in sleeping, eating, energy,  		concentration, or feeling bad about themselves; and if the respondent thought  		about, planned, or attempted suicide.</p>
<p>The survey also includes information on use of tobacco, alcohol,  		marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, pain  		relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. Questions address whether  		respondents have used a particular substance; how often; how long it has been  		since they used the substance; and how old they were when they first used it. A  		noncore section asks other questions about substance use, which in 2010  		included methods of using heroin; methods of using cocaine; use of  		methamphetamine; use of a needle to inject drugs; and use of a variety of drugs  		not specifically queried earlier. Questions also address whether and how often  		the respondent experiences a variety of symptoms of substance abuse and  		dependence, including needing to use an increasing amount to achieve the same  		effect; craving the substance; experiencing withdrawal symptoms; giving up  		activities; having physical health problems caused or made worse by substance  		use; and getting in trouble with the law.</p>

<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH includes information on the number of hospital visits in the  		past year; conditions the respondent has been diagnosed with; whether the  		respondent is covered by Medicare, Medicaid, military health insurance or  		private health insurance; whether that insurance covers treatment for alcohol  		abuse or alcoholism, drug abuse, or mental or emotional problems; and whether  		the family receives SSI or Social Security or Railroad Retirement payments.  		When asked about their work activity, respondents can answer that they did not  		work in the past week because they are disabled.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH covers illicit drug use; tobacco and alcohol use; risk and  		protective factors; dependence, abuse, and treatment; sources of drugs; mental  		health; and demographics.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH is not linked with administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH can be used to estimate the need for treatment facilities for  		mental health and substance use problems in particular areas; to track changes  		in drug use patterns; and to estimate the substance use of people who are not  		working due to a disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>The NSDUH interview consists of core and noncore sections. A core set of  		questions remains in the survey every year and comprises the first part of the  		interview. Noncore questions make up the remainder of the interview. The core  		consists of initial demographic items and questions pertaining to the use of  		tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens,  		inhalants, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. Topics in  		the remaining noncore sections include (but are not limited to) injection drug  		use, perceived risks of substance use, substance dependence or abuse, arrests,  		treatment for substance use problems, pregnancy and health care issues, and  		mental health issues. Noncore demographic questions address such topics as  		immigration, current school enrollment, employment and workplace issues, health  		insurance coverage, and income. Some of the noncore portions of the interview,  		including health insurance coverage and employment, have remained in the  		survey, relatively unchanged, from year to year.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="PSID" id="PSID">PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS  		(PSID)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID provides information on the economic, social, and health  		factors affecting United States families over generations. It collects data on  		expenditures; income; health status; experiences related to drug use, housing  		and neighborhood conditions, education, and employment; and behavior.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID was originally sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  		The primary funding source is now the National Science Foundation, with  		additional funding from numerous federal agencies. The PSID is administered by  		the Survey Research Center at the Institute for Social Research at the  		University of Michigan.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID uses two independent samples: an equal probability sample of  		households from the 48 contiguous states and a national sample of low-income  		families. The second sample selected about 2,000 low-income families with heads  		under age 60 residing in standard MSAs in the North and area that were not  		standard MSAs in the South from the Survey of Economic Opportunity. The PSID  		core sample combines the cross-sectional and low-income samples. Only household  		heads and their spouses are surveyed, but they provide information about other  		family members. While individuals living in group quarters were not part of the  		original sample, the PSID follows sample members whether they remain their  		original household, move to another household, or enter group quarters.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID used a sample of 4,800 families in 1968, and the sample size  		increased to more than 9,000 families in 2009. By 2009 the PSID had collected  		information on a cumulative total of about 70,000 individuals.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID does not produce estimates at regional or state levels.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID follows individuals in the original sample over their  		lifetimes, even as family members leave their homes to establish new households  		of their own.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID has been fielded since 1968 when the original sample was  		selected. The PSID interviewed sample members every year from 1968 to 1997, and  		then began conducting interviews biennially. As respondents children form  		their own independent family units, the PSID continues to interview them and  		members of their new family unit. In order to better reflect changing  		demographics, an additional 2,000 families were added to the sample from 1990  		to 1995, 441 additional families were added in 1997, and another 70 were added  		in 1999.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Questions ask respondents if they have any physical or nervous condition  		that limits the type or amount of work they can do and if it limits the type of  		work, the amount of work, or both; for their height and weight; and if they had  		difficulty seeing, even with glasses or prescription lenses, before age 17.</p>
<p>The survey asks if, because of a health or physical problem, respondents  		have any difficulty bathing or showering; dressing; eating; getting in or out  		of bed or a chair; walking; getting outside; or using the toilet; if someone  		usually helps them with any activities in which they are limited; and if they  		usually use special equipment to do each activity. Questions ask if, without  		personal assistance or assistive equipment, they have any difficulty preparing  		meals; shopping for personal toilet items or medicines; managing money; using  		the telephone; doing heavy housework; or doing light housework; and if so, if  		the limitation is due to a health or physical problem.</p>
<p>The PSID asks if respondents have ever been diagnosed by a health  		professional as having a stroke; heart attack; coronary heart disease, angina,  		or congestive heart failure; high blood pressure or hypertension; asthma;  		chronic lung disease; diabetes or high blood sugar; arthritis or rheumatism;  		cancer; or any other serious or chronic condition, and if so how old the  		individuals were when they first were diagnosed; if it got much worse for a  		month or longer in the past 12 months or since it was first diagnosed if it has  		not been 12 months since diagnosis (for strokes and heart attacks, individuals  		are asked instead if another stroke or heart attack occurred over the same time  		frame); and how much the condition limits their normal daily activities.</p>
<p>The PSID asks questions about individuals health before age 17. It  		asks about the quality of their health; if they ever missed a month or more of  		school because of a health problem; if they ever had measles, mumps, or chicken  		pox; and if their parents or guardians smoked. They were also asked if they  		ever had asthma; diabetes; a respiratory problem or disorder; a speech  		impairment; an allergic condition; heart trouble; chronic ear problems or  		infection; epilepsy or seizures; severe headaches or migraines; stomach  		problems; or high blood pressure, at what age they were diagnosed with each  		problem, and until what age they had each problem.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID asks if respondents have ever been diagnosed by a health  		professional as having emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problems. If so, the  		PSID asks how old the individuals were when they first had the problem or were  		diagnosed; if the severity increased for a month or longer in the past 12  		months or since it was first diagnosed if it has not been 12 months since  		diagnosis; and how much the condition limits normal daily activities. If  		individuals have an emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problem they are asked  		to identify their specific disorder.</p>
<p>The survey asks if respondents smoke cigarettes; how many cigarettes  		they smoke per day on average; if they ever smoked cigarettes; if they ever  		drink any alcoholic beverages; how often they drank on average in the last  		year; how many drinks they had on days they drank; and on how many days in the  		last year they had five drinks or more if they are male or four drinks or more  		if they are female.</p>
<p>The survey asks how often in the past 30 days respondents felt so sad  		nothing could cheer them up; nervous, restless or fidgety; hopeless; that  		everything was an effort; or worthless; if these feelings occurred more or less  		often in the past 30 days than was usual; how much more or less often they  		occurred; how much these feelings interfere with their life or activities; how  		many days out of the past 30 days they were totally unable to work or carry out  		their normal activities because of these feelings; and how many of the  		remaining days out of the 30 they were able to work but had to work less  		because of these feelings.</p>
<p>The survey asks if individuals had depression, drug or alcohol problems,  		or any other emotional or psychological problems before age 17; at what age  		they were diagnosed with each problem; and until what age they had each  		problem.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID asks if respondents have ever been diagnosed by a health  		professional as having a permanent loss of memory or mental ability, or a  		learning disorder. If so, the PSID asks how old the individuals were when they  		first had the problem or were diagnosed; if it got much worse for a month or  		longer in the past 12 months or since it was first diagnosed if it has not been  		12 months since diagnosis; and how much the condition limits their normal daily  		activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The PSID asks if respondents are not working because they are  		permanently or temporarily disabled; if they missed work in the past year  		because they were sick or because someone else was sick, and how much time they  		missed; if they received any income in the past year from SSI; other welfare  		funded by local and state governments; Social Security benefits for their own  		or a family members disability; veterans disability; or  		workers compensation, who it was received for, how much they received,  		and in which months they received the income. The PSID includes information on  		the total amount of health care expenditures paid for by individuals and family  		residing with them during the last two years, with and without costs covered by  		insurance. It asks how much the family paid out-of-pocket for nursing home and  		hospital bills; doctor, outpatient surgery, and dental bills; and  		prescriptions, in-home medical care, special facilities, and other  		services.</p>
<p>The PSID asks respondents about the quality of their health in general,  		and how it compares with the last time they were interviewed. They are asked if  		they were patients in a hospital overnight or longer at any time during the  		past year and if so how long they were in the hospital.</p>
<p>The survey asks if any of the other family members residing with  		respondents are in poor health and who those family members are.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Core topics include income sources and amounts; poverty status; public  		assistance in the form of food or housing; other financial matters including  		taxes and inter-household transfers; family structure and demographics; labor  		market work; time spent doing housework; housing; geographic mobility;  		socioeconomic background; and health.</p>
<p>Supplemental topics include housing and neighborhood characteristics  		(1968-1972, 1977-1987); achievement motivation (1972); risk tolerance (1996);  		childcare (1977); child support and child development (1997, 2002); job  		training and acquisition (1978); retirement plans (1981-1983); health status,  		health expenditures, health care of the elderly and parents health (1986,  		1990, 1991, 1993-1995, 1999-2003); financial situation of parents, time and  		monetary help to and from parents (1980, 1988); wealth (1984, 1989, 1994,  		1999-2003); education (1995); military combat experience (1994); immigration  		history (1997); time use (1997, 2002); and philanthropic giving  		(2001-2003).</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>PSID data collected in 2001 have been linked to <a href="#HRS">HRS</a>  		data collected in 2000. PSID data also are linked to <a href="#Census">Census</a> data, allowing for the addition of data on  		neighborhood characteristics for the geographic areas in which panel  		individuals and families reside.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>Because the PSID has followed families over generations since 1968 it  		provides an opportunity for researchers to study the development of  		disabilities over individuals lifetimes from birth to adulthood. Because  		respondents children are followed when they start their own households,  		researchers can gain a better understanding of the effects of upbringing and  		genetics on the development of disabilities within families. Additionally, the  		PSID collects data on pairs of siblings, allowing researchers to control for  		variables, such as family income level, family events, exposure to drugs, and  		thus better isolate the factors contributing to disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>In 1990, 2,000 Latino households, including families originally from  		Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, were added to the sample to keep it  		representative despite changing immigration patterns. The Latino sample was  		dropped after 1995 because the sample did not include the full range of  		post-1968 immigrants (especially Asians). A supplemental sample consisting of  		441 immigrant families was added in 1997, and an additional 70 immigrant  		families in 1999, for a total of 511 families.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="SCF" id="SCF">SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES (SCF)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF is a survey of household finances. The survey collects  		information on income, expenditures, savings, and use of financial institutions  		and services in United States households.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the Statistics of  		Income Division at the U.S. Department of Treasury.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF uses an area probability sample of households. To account for  		income distribution and mitigate nonresponse bias, the SCF adds an additional  		sample of wealthy households selected from tax returns.<sup><a href="#note21">21</a></sup> The head of household, age 18 or older, completes  		the survey on behalf of the entire household.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF uses a national sample of about 4,500 households.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF does not provide regional or state-level estimates</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The 1989 SCF re-interviewed a subset of the 1983 sample. However, the  		current SCF does not revisit households included in previous samples.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF began in 1983 and is fielded every three years.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF does not collect information specific to physical health,  		sensory, and communication disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF does not collect information specific to mental health and  		disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF does not collect information specific to cognitive and  		intellectual disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF collects information about general health status, life  		expectancy, and smoking habits for the respondent and spouse. When asked about  		their work status, respondents may answer that they are disabled. Sample  		members who report an absence from work due to a disability are asked when they  		became disabled, and if they are looking for work or expect to return to work.  		The employment status for respondents who report a disability is recoded into  		the following categories: working and disabled; disabled and expecting to  		return to work; disabled and looking for work; retired and disabled; disabled  		and not expecting to return to work.</p>
<p>The SCF asks if respondents are covered by private health insurance,  		Medicare, or Medicaid; and if they receive income from SSI, other types of  		welfare, disability benefits or military disability benefits.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Topics covered in the SCF include economic expectations and use of  		financial institutions; credit attitudes and credit cards; principal residence  		and lines of credit; real estate and loans to others; businesses; vehicles;  		loans; attitudes about saving and investing; financial assets; work and  		pensions; income; taxes; income expectations; inheritances and charity;  		demographics; and health.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The SCF can be used to evaluate the assets and liabilities of people who  		are not working due to disability. It can be used to compare the types and  		levels of expenditures of people with and without disabilities. Researchers can  		explore whether changes in income are attributed to a disability, or if savings  		decisions are impacted by life expectancy or health status.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="SIPP" id="SIPP">SURVEY OF INCOME AND PROGRAM  		PARTICIPATION (SIPP)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the SIPP is to collect information about the sources and  		amounts of earned and transfer income, labor force participation, program  		participation and eligibility, and general demographic characteristics. This  		information is collected to help measure the effectiveness of existing federal,  		state, and local programs; to estimate future costs and coverage for government  		programs; and to provide statistics on the distribution of income and measures  		of economic well-being in the country.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The SIPP is sponsored by the Census Bureau, U.S. Department of  		Commerce.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The SIPP uses a multistage stratified sample of the United States  		civilian noninstitutionalized population of all ages. Since the 1996 survey it  		has oversampled low-income households. Data are collected on all household  		members regardless of age.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The SIPP sample size varies by panel, and is largest in recent years. It  		ranges from 12,400-45,000 households, or approximately 26,040-94,500  		individuals assuming an average of 2.1 individuals per household.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The 2008 SIPP was designed to be representative within 20 states and the  		2004 SIPP was designed to be representative within 33 states; previous panels  		were not designed to produce state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>SIPP panels follow households for longitudinal periods ranging from 8  		months to 4 years. Households that move continue to be interviewed if they can  		be located. Individuals 15 years and older who leave the household, but remain  		nonstitutionalized civilians, are interviewed in their new households, along  		with the other members of that household.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>In the original SIPP, administered from 1984 through 1995, new panels  		began yearly. Interviews began in October 1983 for the 1984 panel, and in each  		February starting in 1985. Panel members were divided into four groups that  		were interviewed every fourth month over the course of 32 months, for eight  		Waves of data from each group. The first Wave was interviewed in the first  		month of the panel, the second Wave in the second month, and so on. Several  		panels were ended before all eight Waves were completed due to funding  		issues.</p>
<p>The revised SIPP was first administered in 1996. Major changes to the  		design included four-year concurrent panels, oversampling of households with  		high poverty concentrations, and a larger sample size. A four-year panel began  		in April 1996, a three-year panel began in February 2000 but was canceled after  		eight months due to budget problems, a three-year panel began in February 2001,  		and a four-year panel began in February 2004. A four-year panel began in  		September 2008, with the plan to reduce the sample size by approximately half  		for the fourth year.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Topical modules of the SIPP include information on illnesses and  		injuries; the use of mobility and hearing aids; and difficulty standing;  		sitting; stooping; and reaching overhead.</p>
<p>Topical modules also address difficulty seeing; hearing; speaking;  		lifting 10 or 25 pounds; pulling and pushing large objects; grasping; walking  		up stairs or a quarter mile; using an ordinary telephone; and the ability to  		perform these activities at all.</p>
<p>Topical modules of the SIPP also include information on difficulty  		experienced due to a physical or mental condition getting around inside the  		house; going out of the house; getting in and out of bed or a chair; taking a  		bath or shower; dressing; walking; eating; toileting; keeping track of bills  		(adults only); preparing meals (adults only); doing housework (adults only);  		taking medicine at the correct time (adults only); and whether the help of  		another person is needed to do these things.</p>
<p>Topical modules also include information on whether children have a  		physical or mental condition or a developmental delay that limits ordinary  		activities; a condition that affects their ability to move their arms and legs;  		to play; or limits their ability to do regular schoolwork; and if they receive  		or have ever received special education services.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Topical modules of the SIPP include information on difficulty  		concentrating, remembering, and making decisions.</p>
<p>Topical modules also address whether the respondent is frequently  		depressed or anxious; has trouble getting along with others; has difficulty  		concentrating; or has a hard time dealing with stress; and whether these  		conditions make it difficult or impossible to find or hold a job.</p>
<p>Topical modules of the SIPP also include information on difficulty due  		to a physical or mental condition going out of the house; taking a bath or  		shower; dressing; eating; toileting; keeping track of bills (adults only);  		preparing meals (adults only); doing housework (adults only); taking medicine  		at the correct time (adults only); and whether they need the help of another  		person to do these things.</p>
<p>Topical modules also include information on whether children have a  		physical or mental condition or a developmental delay that limits ordinary  		activities; a condition that affects their ability to play, or limits their  		ability to do regular schoolwork; and if they receive or have ever received  		special education services.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Topical modules of the SIPP include information on whether the  		respondent has a learning disability; mental retardation; a developmental  		disability; Alzheimers or another condition that causes confusion and  		forgetfulness (adults only); ADHD (children only); or another developmental  		condition (children only).</p>
<p>Topical modules also address whether the respondent is frequently  		depressed or anxious; has trouble getting along with others; has difficulty  		concentrating; or has a hard time dealing with stress, and whether these  		conditions make it difficult or impossible to find or hold a job.</p>
<p>Topical modules also include information on whether children have a  		physical or mental condition or a developmental delay that limits ordinary  		activities; a condition that affects their ability to play, or limits their  		ability to do regular schoolwork; if they receive or have ever received special  		education services, and whether they take medicine or receive treatment for  		ADHD.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>Core questions of the SIPP include information on insurance coverage;  		receipt of disability benefits; eligibility or need for other programs due to a  		disability; and if respondents are unable to work due to a disability or other  		illness.</p>
<p>Topical modules of the SIPP include information on hospital stays,  		including the length and reason for visits; doctor visits and other medical  		expenditures; health care expenditures; general health status; health  		conditions; need for help with personal care, household activities, and basic  		errands because of a health condition; the type and source of that help. They  		also include details on health and physical conditions that might affect the  		respondents ability to work, including the specific conditions, the  		condition that primarily limits the respondents ability to work, when the  		condition began, whether the individual was working at the time, whether the  		condition was the result of an illness or injury, and if so where it occurred.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>Core questions, which are repeated in each Wave, solicit information  		about income, eligibility for and participation in transfer programs, household  		and family composition, and labor force behavior.</p>
<p>Topical modules, which appear in select Waves of some panels, include:  		adult well-being; children's well-being; functional limitations and disability;  		health and disability; health status and utilization of health care services;  		long-term care; medical expenses and work disability; work disability history;  		annual income and retirement accounts; assets and liabilities; real estate  		property and vehicles; recipiency history; retirement expectations and pension  		plan coverage; school enrollment and financing; selected financial assets;  		shelter costs and energy usage; support for nonhousehold members; taxes;  		childcare; child support agreements; child support paid; education and training  		history; employment history; job offers; work-related expenses; work schedule;  		extended measures of well-being; family background; fertility history;  		household relationships; marital history; migration history; eligibility for  		and recipiency of public assistance; benefits; job search and training  		assistance; job subsidies; transportation assistance; health care; food  		assistance; electronic transfer of benefits; and denial of benefits.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The Census Bureau has created a number of linked files available on a  		restricted-access basis. These include a match between the 1984 panel and SSA  		records that was available only to SSA analysts for a two-year period; a match  		between the 1984 panel and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information, that was  		used within the Census Bureau; a match between the 1990 panel and IRS data that  		was used internally; and a match between partial data from the 1984 panel and  		data from eight federal and state programs that was used to check the accuracy  		of survey results. Matches between the SIPP and SSA records also are provided  		to SSA on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The SIPP Gold Standard project matched SIPP data from the 1990, 1991,  		1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, and 2004 panels to IRS and SSA records and created  		synthesized data available as PUFs. The Gold Standard File is available for use  		at the Census Bureau. The synthesized data, called SIPP Synthetic Beta (SSB),  		can be accessed more easily, but also can produce misleading results.  		Researchers have the option of running programs on the SSB and having their  		findings verified by the Census Bureau using the Gold Standard File. Plans call  		for the 2008 and future panels to be linked to national and state  		administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The SIPP provides data on income, work behavior, participation in  		programs including disability benefits, and the reasons for changes in program  		participation, including disability onset. It can be used to model the effects  		of changes in benefit eligibility rules; to determine the effect of disability  		onset on work behavior, earnings, assets, benefit receipt, and other components  		of well-being; and to better understand target populations such as those who  		retire before reaching full retirement age or who are uninsured.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>SIPP disability measures are spread between several topical modules. The  		functional limitations and disabilities module is administered approximately  		twice a panel, the health and disability, medical expenses and work disability,  		and work disability history modules are administered approximately once a  		panel, and the health status and utilization of health care services module is  		administered two to three times a panel. Information on sources of income,  		program participation, and the presence of a work disability is collected at  		each interview and status is reported on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>The SIPP is in the process of again being re-designed. Major changes are  		expected to include annual interviews using an event history calendar and more  		extensive use of administrative data to verify and impute results as well as to  		add information not collected in the survey. Disability questions will be  		simplified as part of an effort to create a uniform set of questions that are  		used across a variety of surveys in several countries. Prototypes are currently  		undergoing field tests and refinement. While the re-design originally used the  		title Dynamics of Economic Well-Being, the survey will continue to use the SIPP  		title.</p>
<p>An additional sample of 2,447 known SSDI and SSI beneficiaries were  		interviewed as part of Waves 6 and 7 of the 2001 panel.</p>
<p>The Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) collected information annually from  		1997 to 2002 from members of the 1992 and 1993 panels, which ran until 1996.  		The SPD aimed to provide information on actual and potential program  		participation in order to evaluate the effects of welfare reform legislation  		passed in 1996. Data on employment, income, program participation, health  		insurance and utilization, child well-being, marital relationships, and  		parents' depression was collected every year. Topical modules included a  		self-administered adolescent questionnaire and information on childrens  		residential history and extended measures of well-being.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="SILJ" id="SILJ">SURVEY OF INMATES IN LOCAL JAILS  		(SILJ)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ collects information on individual characteristics of jail  		inmates, including current offenses and detention status, characteristics of  		victims, criminal histories, family background, gun possession and use, prior  		drug and alcohol use and treatment, medical and mental health history and  		treatment, vocational programs and other services provided while in jails, as  		well as other personal characteristics.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S.  		Department of Justice.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>SILJ data are collected through personal interviews with a nationally  		representative sample of inmates in local jails. For the 2002 survey jails were  		selected from those enumerated in the 1999 Census of Jails. Those with a large  		number of inmates had a higher probability of selection than jails with small  		inmate populations. A sample of inmates was then selected from these jails.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ interviewed 6,982 individuals in 417 jails in 2002.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ does not produce regional or state-level estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ does not produce longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ has been conducted in 1978, 1983, 1989, 1996, and most recently  		in 2002.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ asks respondents if they have ever had cancer; or had a heart  		problem; and in each case if so what kind, if they still have it, and if they  		have seen a health care professional for it since admission to jail. The survey  		also asks of they have ever been unable to move parts of their body; had high  		blood pressure; had a stroke or brain injury; had diabetes or high blood sugar;  		had problems with their kidneys; had arthritis or rheumatism; had asthma; been  		told they had cirrhosis of the liver; been told they had hepatitis; or been  		told they had a sexually transmitted disease; and in each case if so if it is  		still a problem and if they have seen a health care professional for it since  		admission to jail.</p>
<p>The SILJ includes information on respondents height and weight.  		The survey asks respondents if they have difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint,  		even when wearing glasses; if they have difficulty hearing a normal  		conversation even when wearing a hearing aid; if they have a speech impairment;  		and if they use a cane, walker, hearing aid, or other device to help with daily  		activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ asks at what age respondents first started drinking; how often  		they drank in the year before being admitted to jail; if they had been drinking  		at the time of the offense; and if so what, how much, and for how many hours;  		if they have ever felt they should cut down on drinking; if people have ever  		annoyed them by criticizing their drinking; if they have ever felt bad or  		guilty about drinking; if they have ever had a drink first thing in the morning  		to steady their nerves or get rid of a hangover; if they have ever driven a  		vehicle after having too much to drink; and if so if they have had an accident  		after drinking.</p>
<p>The survey asks if respondents have ever gotten into situations while or  		after drinking that increased their chances of getting hurt; had arguments with  		family or friends after drinking; or lost a job because of drinking. It asks  		whether in the year before being admitted to jail they had job or school  		trouble; got arrested or held at a police station; or got into a physical fight  		due to drinking. The survey asks whether in the year before being admitted to  		jail the respondent often drank more or longer than they intended to; wanted or  		tried to cut down or drinking but were unable to; spent a lot of time drinking  		or getting over the bad effects of drinking; were kept from doing work, going  		to school, or caring for children due to drinking; gave up activities in which  		they were interested in favor of drinking; continued to drink even though it  		was causing emotional or psychological problems; problems with family, friends,  		or work; or physical health or medical problems; found that their usual number  		of drinks had less effect than it used to; felt bad effects of drinking after  		cutting back or stopping drinking; or often drank or took another drug to get  		over or avoid the bad effects of alcohol. These questions are also asked about  		drug use.</p>
<p>The SILJ asks if respondents have ever used heroin; other opiates;  		methamphetamine; another amphetamine without a prescription; methaqualone  		without a prescription; barbiturates without a prescription; tranquilizers  		without a prescription; crack; cocaine other than crack; PCP; ecstasy; LSD or  		other hallucinogens; marijuana or hashish; other drugs; or inhaled or sniffed  		substances to get high. For each case in which respondents have used the  		substance the survey asks whether they ever used it at least once a week for at  		least a month; whether they used it during the month before their arrest; and  		how often they used it during that month. They are asked if they were under the  		influence of drugs at the time of their offense, and if so which; the source of  		their drugs in the month before arrest; and if they have ever used a needle to  		inject drugs.</p>
<p>The survey asks respondents if they have ever attended a drug or alcohol  		treatment program, and if so what kind; if they have ever attended programs  		while in jail or on parole; if they have attended programs during their current  		stay in jail, and if so if it is required or is offered in exchange for good or  		gain time.</p>
<p>The survey asks if, during the last year, respondents have lost their  		temper easily; been angry more often than usual; hurt or broken things on  		purpose out of anger; thought a lot about getting back at someone; had  		difficulty feeling close to friends and family; had periods when they felt that  		they talked or moved more slowly than usual; had periods when they could not  		sit still; had periods when their thoughts raced; thought that other people  		were able to control their brain and thoughts; had an increase or decrease in  		activity; slept more or less than usual; had more or less of an appetite than  		usual; gave up hope for their life or future; had negative or frightening  		thoughts; felt that other people could read their thoughts; been more or less  		interested in sex than usual; felt that no one cared about them; had periods of  		feeling numb; had a feeling things did not seem real; seen things other people  		said were not there; heard voices other people could not hear; or felt that  		anyone other than corrections staff were spying on or plotting against them. It  		also asks if they have been told by a professional that they have a depressive  		disorder; manic-depression, bipolar disorder, or mania; schizophrenia or  		another psychotic disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; another anxiety  		disorder; a personality disorder; or another mental or emotional condition; and  		if so when they were most recently told that. They are asked if they take  		medicine prescribed by a psychiatrist or other doctor because of an emotional  		or mental problem; have been admitted overnight to a mental hospital, unit, or  		treatment program; have received counseling or therapy from a trained  		professional; or have received other mental health services, and if so if they  		were receiving the service during the year before their arrest and if they have  		received it since being admitted to jail. Respondents are asked if they have  		considered or attempted suicide.</p>
<p>The survey asks respondents if a mental health condition keeps them from  		participating fully in work, school, or other activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ survey asks respondents if they have a learning disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>When asked if they were working before admission to jail respondents can  		report that they were not working due to a medical condition, ill health,  		physical or mental disability. Respondents are also asked if they consider  		themselves to have a disability, and if they have ever been enrolled in special  		education.</p>
<p>The survey asks whether, in the month before admission, the respondent  		received Social Security or SSI; or workers or veterans  		compensation. It also asks if they have ever received income from Social  		Security as a result of a retirement, survivors, or disability benefit; and if  		they have ever received SSI.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ collects information on current offenses and detention status;  		pretrial release and trial; current sentence; incident characteristics;  		criminal history; socioeconomic characteristics; alcohol and drug use and  		treatment; medical conditions, mental health, and disabilities; and jail  		programs and activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ is not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The SILJ can be used to estimate the prevalence of disability among jail  		inmates; to compare substance use, abuse, and dependence between the  		incarcerated and general population; and to describe the presence and need for  		targeted health care and treatment programs within jails.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>Recent modifications include enhanced questions on medical and mental  		health histories of inmates and a sample design modification to ensure a  		representative sample of juveniles being held in local jails.</p>

</ul><h3><a name="SISCF/SIFCF" id="SISCF/SIFCF">SURVEY OF INMATES IN STATE AND  		FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES (SISCF/SIFCF)</a></h3>
<p><i><b>General Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF collect data on inmates of state and federal prisons  		to assist policy makers in assessing needs and remedying deficiencies in the  		nation's correctional institutions.</p>
<p><i><b>Sponsoring Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S.  		Department of Justice. The SIFCF is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice  		Statistics and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p><i><b>Sampling Universe</b></i></p>
<p>The SIFCF uses a nationally representative sample of sentenced federal  		inmates held in federally-owned and federally-operated facilities. The SISCF  		uses a nationally representative sample of state prison inmates. Prisons are  		identified from the Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities and  		records of new prisons opened since the previous <a href="#Census">Census</a>.  		Inmates are then sampled from selected prisons. Personal interviews are  		conducted with inmates from June through October of each survey year.</p>
<p>Due to the large proportion of drug offenders in the federal system, to  		ensure a large enough sample of nondrug offenders an oversample of inmates was  		selected, from which 1 of every 3 drug offenders was retained.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Size</b></i></p>
<p>The 2004 SISCF used a sample of 14,499 individuals in 287 prisons. The  		2004 SIFCF used a sample of 3,606 individuals in 148 prisons.</p>
<p><i><b>Regional and State-Level Estimates</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF do not support regional or state-level  		estimates.</p>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Data</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF do not produce longitudinal data.</p>
<p><i><b>Frequency of Data Collection and Year(s) Fielded</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF were fielded simultaneously using the same survey  		instrument in 1991, 1997, and 2004. The SISCF was previously conducted in 1974,  		1979, and 1986.</p>
<p><i><b>Physical Health, Sensory, and Communication Disability  		Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF ask respondents if they have ever had cancer or had  		a heart problem, and in each case if so what kind, if they still have it, and  		if they have seen a health care professional for it since admission to prison.  		The surveys also ask if respondents have ever been unable to move parts of  		their body; had high blood pressure; had a stroke or brain injury; had diabetes  		or high blood sugar; had problems with their kidneys; had arthritis or  		rheumatism; had asthma; been told they had cirrhosis of the liver; been told  		they had hepatitis; or been told they had a sexually transmitted disease; and  		in each case if so if it is still a problem and if they have seen a health care  		professional for it since admission to prison.</p>

<p><i><b>Mental Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF ask respondents if they have ever taken medicine  		prescribed by a psychiatrist or another doctor due to an emotional or mental  		problem; if they were taking it anytime in the year before their arrest; if  		they were taking it at the time of the offense for which they are in prison;  		and if they have taken medication for an emotional or mental problem since they  		were admitted to prison.</p>
<p>Respondents are asked at what age they started drinking; if they drank  		during the year before their arrest, and if so how often; if they had been  		drinking at the time of the offense for which they were arrested, and if so for  		how many hours, what, and how much. They are asked if they have ever felt they  		should cut down on drinking; if people have ever annoyed them by criticizing  		their drinking; if they have ever felt bad or guilty about drinking; if they  		have ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady their nerves or get  		rid of a hangover; if they have ever driven a vehicle after having too much to  		drink; and if so if they have had an accident after drinking.</p>

<p>The surveys ask respondents if a mental health condition keeps them from  		participating fully in work, school, or other activities.</p>
<p><i><b>Cognitive and Intellectual Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF ask respondents if they have a learning  		disability.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Health and Disability Measures</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF ask if respondents were taking prescription  		medication when they were admitted to prison, and if so if they have continued  		to since. If respondents were not working at the time of their arrest they can  		answer that this was because of a medical condition, ill health, physical or  		mental disability. Respondents are also asked if they consider themselves to  		have a disability, and if they have ever been enrolled in special  		education.</p>
<p>Respondents are asked if they received Social Security; SSI; or  		workers or veterans compensation payments during the month before  		their arrest; and whether they have ever received income from Social Security  		as a result of a retirement, survivors, or disability benefit; or from SSI.</p>
<p><i><b>Topic Areas</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF collect information on inmates current offense  		and sentence; criminal history; family background and personal characteristics;  		prior drug and alcohol use and treatment programs; gun possession and use; and  		prison activities, programs and services.</p>
<p><i><b>Links to Administrative Data</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF are not linked to administrative data.</p>
<p><i><b>Potential Uses for Disability-Related Research</b></i></p>
<p>The SISCF and SIFCF can be used to follow the presence of and need for  		specialized health care and substance abuse programs in prisons over time; to  		estimate the prevalence of disability among the incarcerated population; or to  		compare the prison experiences of those with and without disabilities, or those  		with different kinds of disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Notable Features</b></i></p>
<p>With each round of the survey, the questionnaire has been modified in  		order to capture information on evolving issues in criminal justice and topics  		of the greatest interest to users. Recent modifications include enhanced  		questions on medical and mental health histories of inmates.</p>
