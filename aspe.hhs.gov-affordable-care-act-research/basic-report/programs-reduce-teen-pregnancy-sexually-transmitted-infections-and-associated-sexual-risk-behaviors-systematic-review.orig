<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Methods: </span></b><span>The review was    conducted in four steps.

Randomized controlled trials accounted for the large majority    (87 percent) of included studies. Most studies (76 percent) included multiple    follow-ups, with sample sizes ranging from 62 to 5,244.

Key strengths of the literature are    the large number of randomized controlled trials, the common use of multiple    follow-up periods, and attention to a broad range of program models delivered    in diverse settings. Two main gaps are a lack of replication studies and the    need for more research on Latino youth and other high-risk populations. In    addressing these gaps, studies must overcome common limitations in research    quality and reporting standards that have negatively affected prior research.    </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">High rates of teen pregnancy,  sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and associated sexual risk behaviors  remain a troubling issue in the United States. Nationwide, 47 percent of high  school students have had sexual intercourse, and 24 percent report having had  four or more partners by graduation<sup></sup>(CDC 2012). In 2011, nearly 40  percent of sexually active high school students had not used a condom during  their last sexual intercourse<sup></sup>(CDC 2012). These behaviors increase the  risks of pregnancy and STIs, including HIV. Preliminary national data for 2011  indicate there were approximately 31.3 births per 1,000 females 15 to 19 years  of age (Hamilton et al. 2012), a rate higher than in most other industrialized  countries (United Nations 2012). In addition, estimates suggest that  adolescents and young adults account for half of all new STI cases in the United  States every year (Weinstock et al. 2004).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In response to these risks, in  late 2009 and early 2010, the U.S. Congress authorized two new federal programs  to support evidence-based approaches to teen pregnancy prevention: the Teen  Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, administered by the Office of Adolescent  Health (OAH) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH), and  the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), authorized under the 2010  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and administered by the Family  and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) within the Administration for Children and  Families (ACF). The TPP program and PREP provide federal grant funding to local  and state organizations to support evidence-based and promising approaches to  teen pregnancy prevention. The programs are “tiered” so that the majority of  funding goes toward replicating programs with existing evidence of  effectiveness, while a smaller amount goes toward implementing and evaluating  untested approaches. The first program grant announcements were released in  spring 2010, for funding through 2015.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To help inform these new grant  programs, in 2009, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  launched a systematic review of research on programs to reduce teen pregnancy,  STIs, and associated sexual risk behaviors. The main purpose of the review is  to identify, assess, and rate the rigor of program impact studies on teen  pregnancy and STI prevention programs. The term “program” is defined broadly to  include any structured intervention with an educational component, including  classroom- or group-based curricula, individualized clinic services, and youth  development approaches. The review findings are used to describe the strength of  evidence supporting different program models and to identify programs with  evidence of impacts on teen pregnancy, STIs, or associated risk behaviors. The  review focuses only on assessing the research evidence. It does not examine the  specific content, lesson plans, or delivery of any program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The project has so far involved  two rounds of reviews. An initial review of the evidence began in fall 2009,  covering research released from 1989 through roughly December 2009. Summary  findings were released in spring 2010 in conjunction with the TPP program and  PREP Innovative Strategies (PREIS) grant announcements (OAH 2010). The findings  were also highlighted in the 2010 state PREP grant announcement (ACF 2010). The  review findings were later updated in spring 2012 to cover research published  from roughly December 2009 through January 2011. Additional updates are planned  for the future.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This paper presents additional  findings from the review beyond those highlighted in the federal grant  announcements. Specifically, the paper presents detailed counts of the number  of studies that have been considered for review and the number that met the review  criteria for study quality. The paper also presents information on the  characteristics of included studies and the number of program models with  evidence of impacts on teen pregnancy, STIs, or associated risk behaviors.  Findings are used to draw conclusions about the relative strengths and  weaknesses of the literature and directions for improving future research.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Methods</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The review is conducted for HHS  by Mathematica Policy Research and a partner organization, Child Trends. HHS  initiated and defined the scope of the review. Mathematica developed the review  protocol at the direction of HHS. Mathematica also has lead responsibility for  identifying studies, training and managing the review team, and synthesizing  the results. The study assessments and data extraction are conducted by trained  reviewers from Mathematica and Child Trends, all with doctorates or master’s  degrees in a relevant discipline. Reviewers are required to declare any  conflicts of interest. None have been reported to date.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The review is conducted  following a protocol developed by Mathematica at the direction of HHS  (Mathematica Policy Research 2012). In developing the protocol, the review team  drew on the standards and procedures used by established systematic reviews and  evidence assessment groups (Advocates for Youth 2008; Blueprints for Violence  Prevention 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011; Kirby 2007;  Scher et al. 2006; What Works Clearinghouse 2012). The protocol was first  developed in September 2009 for the initial review of the evidence. The  protocol was later amended in December 2010 to expand the literature search  through roughly January 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Study Identification</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the initial review of the  evidence, studies were identified in four ways: (1) scanning the reference  lists of prior systematic reviews and research syntheses (Advocates for Youth  2008; Ball and Moore 2008; Chin et al. 2012; Kim and Rector 2008; Kirby 2007;  Oringanje et al. 2009; Scher et al. 2006); (2) searching the websites of  relevant federal agencies and research or policy organizations; (3) issuing a  public call for studies to identify new or unpublished research; and (4) having  a research librarian conduct a keyword search of electronic citation databases.  For the first update to the review findings, the review team also conducted a  hand search of 10 relevant research journals and scanned the conference  proceedings of five professional associations. The search covered both  published and unpublished studies. Focusing only on published studies can lead  to bias in systematic reviews (IOM 2011), since published studies tend to  overrepresent favorable and statistically significant findings relative to null  or negative findings. Additional details on the search strategy are available  in the review protocol (Mathematica Policy Research 2012).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Study Screening</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All studies identified through  the literature search were screened against prespecified inclusion criteria. To  be eligible for review, a study had to examine the impacts of an intervention  using quantitative data and statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Both  randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiments were eligible. Given this  focus on studies designed to test causal program effects, the review excluded  the large number of correlational studies that examine risk and protective  factors for adolescent sexual activity, as well as qualitative studies of  program implementation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A study had to measure program  impacts on a least one measure of pregnancy, STIs, or associated sexual risk  behaviors (sexual initiation, frequency of sexual activity, recent sexual  activity, number of sexual partners, or contraceptive use). Measures without  established validity (for example, reports from males of their female partners’  use of birth control pills) and composite scales of sexual risk behavior were  excluded. The study sample had to consist of U.S. youth ages 19 or younger at  the time of sample enrollment. International studies were excluded. The initial  review of the evidence covered studies released from 1989 through roughly  December 2009. The updated review findings added studies released from roughly  December 2009 through January 2011.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The range of eligible program  models included all programs eligible for funding under the federal TPP  program. This included individualized and group curriculum-based programs, as  well as youth development approaches. It excluded early childhood education  programs, home visiting programs, high school dropout prevention programs, <a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack"></a>and broad state- or federal-policy changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The screening process had two  steps. First, the review team screened the titles and abstracts of all studies  identified through the literature search. Second, for studies that passed this  first stage of screening, the review team obtained full text of the studies for  another round of screening. In some cases, study authors reported findings from  a single study in multiple journal articles or reports (for example,  Basen-Engquist et al. 2001; Coyle et al. 1999, 2001; Kirby et al. 2004, 2011).  To avoid double-counting these studies, the review team linked together any  articles or reports generated from the same underlying study. In other cases, a  single journal article or report presented findings from multiple studies or a  multi-armed trial (for example, Jemmott et al. 1998). In these cases, the  review team counted each study or trial arm separately.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Study Quality Assessment</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All studies that met the review  inclusion criteria were assessed by teams of two trained reviewers for the  quality and execution of their research designs. The reviewers made their  assessments following a prespecified set of standards documented in the review  protocol. Differences of opinion were resolved through consensus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the end of the assessment,  each study was assigned a quality rating of <i>high, moderate,</i> or <i>low</i>  according to the risk of bias in the study’s impact estimates. The highest  quality rating was reserved for randomized controlled trials with low attrition  of sample members, no reassignment of sample members across conditions, and no  systematic differences in the timing or mode of data collection across the  treatment and control groups. Cluster randomized trials were required to have  at least two clusters (of schools, classrooms, and so on) assigned to each  condition. Studies that received this highest rating were considered to provide  the most credible estimates of program effects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The moderate quality rating was  considered for (1) quasi-experimental comparison group designs and (2)  randomized controlled trials that did not meet all the review criteria for the  highest quality rating. To receive a moderate rating, a study had to  demonstrate baseline equivalence of the research groups (that is, the program  and comparison groups) on three key demographic characteristics: age, gender,  and race/ethnicity. For studies with sample members at least 14 years old at  baseline, the study authors also had to demonstrate evidence of baseline  equivalence for at least one outcome measure. This criterion was not applied to  studies with younger sample members who were less than 14 years old, because  rates of sexual risk behaviors are very low for this age group. As required for  the highest study rating, the timing and mode of data collection had to be the  same across program and comparison groups, and cluster designs had to have at  least two clusters (of schools, classrooms, and so on) in each group.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The lowest quality rating was  applied to studies that did not meet the review standards for either a high or  moderate rating. Low-rated studies were excluded from the subsequent data  extraction and analysis, as the risk of bias in these studies was considered  too high to yield credible estimates of program effects. A more detailed  description and justification of the study ratings is presented in the review  protocol (Mathematica Policy Research 2012).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Data Extraction</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For studies that met the review  criteria for a high or moderate quality rating, the review team extracted  information on the program model tested, evaluation setting, study sample, and  research design. The review team also extracted detailed information on the  program impact estimates. Specifically, for each relevant outcome, the review  team recorded the name and description of the outcome measure, length of  follow-up, analytic sample used to estimate the program impact, magnitude of  the impact estimate, reported statistical confidence interval or associated  standard error of the estimate, reported <i>p</i>-value or other associated  test statistic, and statistical significance level as reported by the study  authors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Analysis</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The analysis had three steps.  First, all studies included in the data extraction were tabulated by program  type and other key features of the evaluation setting, study sample, and  research design. These tabulations were used to summarize and describe  characteristics of the evidence base. Second, the program impact findings were  used to identify program models with evidence of a statistically significant  positive effect (and no adverse effects) on at least one of the following outcomes:  sexual activity (initiation, recent sexual activity, frequency of sexual  activity, or number of partners); contraceptive use or consistency of use; STIs;  or pregnancy or birth. To reduce the possibility of detecting chance findings  due to multiple hypothesis testing, this assessment was limited to program  impacts estimated for either the full study sample or a subgroup defined by  gender or baseline sexual experience. Third, the review team tabulated the  resulting program models according to the strength and nature of the supporting  evidence (for example, the duration of program impacts, and whether the  observed impacts have been replicated by two or more studies).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The review did not consider  evidence from subgroups defined by sexual activity at follow-up. To estimate  program impacts on measures such as condom or contraceptive use, studies often  limit their analytic samples to only those youth who report being sexually  active at follow-up. These impact estimates are at risk of bias, however,  because the size and composition of this “endogenous” subgroup of sexually  active youth may be affected by the intervention (Colman 2012). To minimize the  risk of bias, the review focused only on analytic samples defined by  characteristics independent of the intervention—namely, either the full study  sample or subgroups defined by gender or sexual experience at baseline<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span>.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The review did not require  conducting a quantitative meta-analysis. The main purpose of the review was to  describe the evidence base and identify program models with evidence of  positive impacts on youth outcomes. In identifying these programs, there was  little need or opportunity to average impact findings for the same program  across multiple studies, because the large majority of teen pregnancy and STI  prevention programs have been evaluated only once (shown below). Unlike some  prior systematic reviews of the teen pregnancy prevention literature (Chin et  al. 2012; Gavin et al. 2010; Oringanje et al. 2009; Scher et al. 2006), this  review did not aim to summarize or compare findings across broader groups of  program models.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Results</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">More than 1,900 citations were  found through the literature search (Figure 1). From this initial citation  list, 1,438 (73 percent) were screened out by title and abstract. Full text  articles were obtained for 541 citations, and from these citations, the review  team identified 452 unique studies. An additional 252 studies were screened out  after reviewing the full text, and 112 studies were dropped for failing to meet  the review criteria for a high or moderate study quality rating. A total of 88  studies met the review criteria for a high or moderate rating and were included  in the final data extraction and analysis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The studies tested a mix of  program models delivered in diverse settings (Table 1). Nearly half the  included studies (47 percent) examined impacts for sexuality education  programs—defined broadly as curriculum-based programs providing general  information on teen pregnancy and STI prevention, including the use of  contraceptives. Other studies examined abstinence-based programs (19 percent),  clinic-based programs offering individualized services (11 percent), youth  development programs (11 percent), or programs for specialized populations such  as pregnant or parenting teens or youth in the foster care or juvenile justice  systems (11 percent). Most programs were delivered in after school or  community-based organizations (38 percent) or in school during the regular  school day (29 percent). Among the in-school programs, more were delivered in  middle schools than in high schools or elementary schools. Relatively few  studies were set in community health clinics (16 percent) or specialized  settings such as juvenile justice facilities (11 percent). Six percent of the  studies combined data across multiple settings.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Most studies (62 percent)  included mixed-sex samples, and slightly more than half featured predominately  African American samples (51 percent). Among the single-sex studies, more  focused on females than on males. The distribution of studies by age group  found equal proportions of studies with youth ages 14 to 17 (44 percent) and  youth ages 13 and under (44 percent). Fewer studies focused on older youth ages  18 or 19 (11 percent).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Randomized controlled trials  accounted for a large majority of included studies (Table 2). The most common  method was random assignment of individual youth (44 percent), but nearly an  equal proportion (41 percent) assigned youth in clusters such as schools. Two  studies used a mix of individual- and cluster-based assignment. Few studies  used quasi-experimental designs (13 percent). Sample sizes ranged from a low of  62 to a high of 5,244, with a median sample size of 447.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most studies involved more than  one follow-up period. Indeed, nearly half (47 percent) involved three or more  follow-ups. In most studies, the first follow-up was conducted immediately after  the intervention. The length of the last follow-up ranged from immediately after  the intervention to 15 years after the intervention ended. The most common  outcome measures examined were behavioral: sexual activity (86 percent) and  contraceptive use and/or consistency (80 percent). Fewer studies examined  impacts on STIs (23 percent) or pregnancy or births (28 percent).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Among the 88 studies included  in the analysis, the review team identified 78 unique program models (Figure  2). The number of unique program models is only slightly lower than the number  of studies because few programs have been evaluated more than once. Among the  78 unique programs, 34 had null findings: the review team found no evidence of  a statistically significant positive impact on teen pregnancy, STIs, or sexual  risk behaviors for either the full sample or a key subgroup. Another 13  programs were dropped because evidence of positive impacts was shown only for  an endogenous subgroup defined by sexual activity at follow-up. For the  remaining 31 programs, the review team found evidence of a statistically  significant positive impact (and no adverse effects) on at least one targeted  outcome measure.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most of the positive impact  evidence focused on measures of sexual activity and contraceptive use (Table  3). Among the 31 program models with evidence of effectiveness, 22 had impacts  on a measure of sexual activity, 14 had impacts on a measure of contraceptive  use or consistency, 5 had impacts on STIs, and 5 had impacts on pregnancy or  birth. Of the 31 programs, 19 had impacts on only one of these four categories  of outcome measures, 10 had impacts on two or three categories of outcomes, and  one program (DiClemente et al. 2004) had impacts on all four categories of  outcome measures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One program model (Jemmott  1992; Jemmott et al. 1999, 2010) had evidence of impacts replicated across  multiple studies (Table 4). The other programs were supported by evidence from  a single qualifying impact study. In most cases, the supporting impact study  was a randomized controlled trial that met the review criteria for a high study  quality rating. The remaining programs were supported by either a  quasi-experimental study (four programs) or a randomized trial that met the  review criteria for a moderate (but not high) study quality rating (six  programs). A total of 9 programs were supported by evidence of subgroup  impacts, defined </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The number and rigor of  evaluation studies on teen pregnancy and STI prevention programs have grown  substantially since the 1980s. To help summarize this research, a systematic  review of the literature, sponsored by HHS as part of the federal government’s  recent efforts to promote evidence-based approaches to teen pregnancy  prevention, identified and assessed some 200 program impact studies released  from 1989 through early 2011. Of the studies assessed, a total of 88 met the  review criteria for study design and execution. Analysis of the study impact  findings identified 31 program models with evidence of a statistically  significant positive impact on teen pregnancy, STIs, or associated sexual risk  behaviors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Prominence of Randomized  Trials</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A main strength of the  literature is the large number of randomized controlled trials. In some areas  of program evaluation and policy research, randomized controlled trials either are  not feasible or are considered an unrealistic standard. For example, in studies  of community-level interventions, there are often too few communities involved  to support a sufficiently powered randomized trial. By contrast, in this review  of the teen pregnancy and STI prevention literature, a large majority of  included studies (87 percent) used randomized designs. These designs have been  used successfully with all types of program models and in diverse settings,  ranging from schools (such as Coyle et al. 1999, 2001; Tortolero et al. 2009)  to juvenile justice facilities (such as Bryan et al. 2009; Magura et al. 1994).  These findings strongly suggest that randomized controlled trials are a  realistic expectation for the teen pregnancy and STI prevention literature and  the foundation on which future research should be built.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Use of Multiple Follow-Up  Surveys</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another strength of the  literature is the common use of multiple follow-up surveys. Conducting multiple  follow-ups enables researchers to test both short- and longer-term program  impacts as well as the mechanisms or pathways through which programs work. For  example, studies often use shorter-term follow-up surveys to measure program  impacts on key mediating outcomes such as skills, attitudes, and intentions.  Longer-term follow-ups are often better for measuring program impacts on  behaviors or health outcomes, which can take longer to emerge. Researchers are  clearly attuned to the benefits of multiple follow-up surveys, as just over  three-quarters (76 percent) of the studies included in the review featured more  than one follow-up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Future research should more carefully  consider the best timing for follow-up surveys. A relatively common approach is  to conduct follow-ups at regular six-month intervals—for example, immediately  after the intervention and again 6 and 12 months later. For most studies, this  schedule is sufficient for measuring program impacts on sexual activity or  contraceptive use, but it does not always allow for measuring impacts on  pregnancy and STIs, two outcomes that take longer to unfold. The frequent use  of a 6-month follow-up schedule is likely one reason studies tend to focus more  on behavioral outcomes such as sexual activity and contraceptive use than on the  longer-term health outcomes of STIs and pregnancy. Future studies should  consider whether alternative follow-up schedules—for example, two follow-ups  conducted 6- and 18-months after the intervention—allow for testing impacts on  a broader range of outcomes at similar cost.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Less clear is the ideal number  of follow-ups. A full 20 percent of studies included in the review featured  four or more follow-ups. However, unless the program is especially long or the  study is designed to test very long-term effects (Hawkins et al. 1999, 2008;  Lonczak et al. 2002), the analytic value of four or more follow-ups is often  modest, at increased cost. Adding a fourth or fifth follow-up can also lead to  overly optimistic assessments of program effectiveness—namely, if analyses  using each round of follow-up data are treated as independent assessments. To  help avoid chance findings, researchers must apply appropriate statistical  adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing to control the type-1 error rate.  Given these concerns, resources are often better spent increasing the study  sample size or obtaining higher response rates than adding a fourth or fifth  follow-up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Diversity of Program Models  and Settings</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The literature is also strong  in its focus on a broad range of program models delivered in diverse settings.  High-quality studies have been conducted with programs ranging from  curriculum-based abstinence and sexuality education programs to individualized  clinic-based services, in settings ranging from schools to residential  substance abuse and mental health facilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This diversity is important for  two reasons. For one, there is no single recipe for success in improving  adolescent sexual health outcomes. Prior studies have shown that, among similar  types of programs (for example, among all clinic-based or youth development  programs), there is often significant variation in program impacts (Chin et al.  2012; Kirby 2007; Underhill et al. 2007a, 2007b). Some programs have  demonstrated evidence of success whereas others have not. Even in cases in  which two programs have tried following the same approach, the impacts on youth  outcomes have differed (see for example, Philliber et al. 2002; Kirby et al.  2005). Until there is more rigorous evidence about why some program models are  more effective than others, the field is best served by continuing to test a  range of programmatic approaches.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Diversity is also important to  meet the unique needs and interests of local communities. No single program  model is right for every population and setting. For example, schools have  different programmatic needs than community-based organizations or  institutional settings such as juvenile justice facilities. Similarly, youth in  rural areas may respond differently to programs originally developed in urban  settings (Stanton et al. 2005, 2006). Because no one size fits all, it is  important to have a variety program models available for implementation, and  this in turn requires a research literature that is equally broad in focus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Need for Studies of  Replication and Scale-Up</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The biggest gap in the  literature is a lack of replication studies. Researchers increasingly recognize  replication as a key step in the process of identifying effective interventions  (Valentine et al. 2011). Yet the findings from this review show that only one  program model (Jemmott 1992; Jemmott et al. 1999, 2010) in the teen pregnancy  and STI prevention literature has demonstrated evidence of program impacts  across multiple studies. Instead, most of the current evidence base consists of  single small-scale “efficacy trials” (Flay et al. 2005) conducted in closely  managed settings, often by the program developers. These efficacy studies are  important for establishing initial evidence of program impacts, but to  determine whether the impacts generalize to broader populations and more  real-world conditions, they must be followed by subsequent effectiveness or  replication studies, ideally conducted independently of the program developer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Research from outside the field  of teen pregnancy and STI prevention finds that efficacy trials typically  produce larger impacts than when programs are “scaled up” as in effectiveness or  replication studies. For example, a recent review article of early intervention  programs for crime and delinquency prevention suggests that program impacts may  be “discounted” by up to 50 percent when programs are implemented on a very  large scale (Welsh et al. 2010). For the literature on teen pregnancy and STI  prevention programs, these findings give warning that the existing evidence in  support of some program models may weaken as the research literature expands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Need for Research on  High-Risk Populations</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is also a need for more  research on specific populations at high risk for teen pregnancies or STIs,  most notably the large and growing U.S. Latino population. Latino youth  currently have the highest teen birth rate of all major racial/ethnic groups in  the United States—49.4 births per 1,000 teens ages 15 to 19, compared with the  national average of 31.3 per 1,000 teens (Hamilton et al. 2012). Yet this  review found that less than a quarter of the relevant impact studies conducted  to date had predominately Latino research samples. Only two program models  designed specifically for use with Latino youth have found evidence of a  statistically significant program impact on sexual risk behaviors (Lesser et  al. 2009; Villarruel et al. 2006), and one of these programs is used only with  teen parents. Five other programs with evidence of effectiveness were evaluated  with predominately Latino research samples (Coyle et al. 2004; Coyle et al.  2006; Koniak-Griffin et al. 2003; Rotheram-Borus et al. 2003, 2004; Tortolero et  al. 2009), but the programs themselves were not culturally tailored  specifically for Latinos.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is also little evidence  for smaller but high-risk groups such as pregnant or parenting teens, youth  living in foster care, and American Indian and Alaska Natives. Only two studies  included in the review focused specifically on pregnant and parenting teens (Koniak-Griffin  et al. 2003; Lesser et al. 2009), one examined youth in foster care (Kerr et  al. 2009), and none focused specifically on American Indians and Alaska  Natives. All of these groups are at above-average risk of teen pregnancy  (Bilaver and Courtney 2006; Klerman 2004; Suellentrop and Hunter 2009) and thus  merit the attention of future research.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Need for Improved Research  Quality and Reporting</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addressing these gaps,  studies also must strive for improved research quality and reporting standards.  More than half the studies considered for this review did not pass the bar for  study design and execution. Three common problems that led to a downgrade in  study rating were high rates of sample attrition in randomized trials, poorly  matched comparison groups in quasi-experimental studies, and the use of a  cluster design with only one cluster assigned to each research group. Some  studies failed to report a complete description of the study design and  execution. The median sample size was 447, which may be too small to detect  substantively meaningful program effects (Kirby 2007).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other common problems that did  not factor directly into our review but represent key areas for improvement  were failure to properly adjust statistical significance tests for multiple  hypothesis testing or the use of a clustered study design, insufficient  reporting of consent rates and the timing of consent in randomized trials, and  a heavy reliance on subgroup estimates to demonstrate evidence of program  effects (Donner and Klar 2004; Schochet 2009).  Studies also failed to  consistently report effect size information. More than one-third of all  statistically significant impact estimates were lacking necessary information  to calculate an effect size. All of these issues can be addressed through more  careful execution of the evaluation study and more complete reporting of future  research studies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Summary and Conclusions</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like any field of research, the  evidence base on teen pregnancy and STI prevention programs has both strengths  and weaknesses. Key strengths are the large number of randomized controlled  trials, the common use of multiple follow-up surveys, and attention to a broad  range of program models delivered in diverse settings. Main weaknesses are the  current lack of replication studies, the need for more research on Latinos and  other high-risk populations, and a general need for improved research quality  and reporting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Addressing these gaps is  important not only to advance the research literature but also to inform future  policy initiatives and programming decisions. Efforts like the new federal TPP  program and PREP reflect a growing emphasis on the use of research evidence in  policy and programming decisions (Haskins and Baron 2011). Both within and  outside the federal government, funding decisions are increasingly conditioned  on available evidence of program effectiveness. Such reliance on evidence has  the potential to maximize the effectiveness of new policy initiatives and make  the best use of scarce public resources. But evidence-based policies and  programs are only as strong as the supporting research evidence. In addition to  the need for rigorous program impact studies, there is also a need for research  on program implementation, measures of fidelity, identification of core  components, and acceptable adaptations. Such a strong and expanding research  literature is necessary to ensure that evidence-based approaches to teen pregnancy  prevention make a positive difference in the lives of youth.</p>
