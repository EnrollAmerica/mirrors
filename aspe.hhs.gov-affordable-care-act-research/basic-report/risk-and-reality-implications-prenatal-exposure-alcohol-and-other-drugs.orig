<h2>THE IMPLICATIONS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO  ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS</h2>

<hr /><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The use of illicit drugs and abuse of alcohol exact a  steep price from our society. The complicity of substance  abuse in serious social ills such as crime, domestic  violence, and traffic injuries is well established.  Recently, however, another threat has come to the attention  of the public. This is the threat to children born to women  who abuse alcohol and other drugs during their pregnancy.  Experts now estimate that one-half to three-quarters of a  million infants are born each year who have been exposed to  one or more illicit drugs in utero. When the legal drugsalcohol  and tobaccoare added, the figure rises to considerably  more than one million substance exposed infants.</p>
<p>The onset of the crack epidemic during the 1980s gave  rise to a number of rather dramatic articles in the press  that often presented an image of drug-exposed infants and  children as "hopeless" members of a "lost  generation" (Toufexis 1991; Norris 1991).  These  articles, based largely on anecdotal accounts, helped to  fuel a number of misperceptions.  Among them are:  </p>
<ul><li> There are an ever-increasing number of drug-exposed  children who will in time overrun Head Start programs, early  elementary classrooms, and social service agencies.  </li>
<li> There are permanent neurological, developmental, and  behavioral consequences that are directly attributable to  prenatal drug exposure.  </li>
<li> Preschools and schools are unprepared to effectively  control and educate children who were prenatally exposed to  drugs.  </li>
</ul><p>As a result of these portraits of children with  intractable deficits, Head Start and public school staff  have grown concerned about the unknown numbers of  drug-exposed children who might enter their classrooms. In  fact, teachers and administrators report increasing numbers  of children who lack social skills and have difficulty  keeping pace with routine demands. Some children are  persistently withdrawn; others are prone to sudden episodes  of violence. Primed by inaccurate media reports, educators  have begun attributing these behaviors, as well as a wide  range of other behaviors and developmental delays, to the  effects of prenatal drug exposure. </p>
<p>Although prenatal drug exposure has captured a great  deal of public attention, prenatal exposure to alcohol is  more widespread and has perhaps an even more serious impact.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 60  percent of women of childbearing age consume alcoholic  beverages despite the fact that alcohol consumption during  pregnancy is implicated in a wide range of birth defects and  developmental disabilities, including mental retardation,  physical abnormalities, and visual and auditory impairments.  </p>
<p>As they assess the threat that prenatal exposure to  alcohol and other drugs presents to children and schools,  policy makers and practitioners must separate myth from  fact. The practice of labeling children should also be  avoided since it can lead teachers and parents to have  diminished expectations for educational success. Finally,  educators and parents need assistance in creating an  educational environment that will enable children to fulfill  their potential.  </p>
<h2>OVERVIEW OF THE MONOGRAPH</h2>
<p>This monograph is one in a series of products created by  Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) to address the  needs of administrators and teachers for accurate,  up-to-date information on the effects of prenatal exposure  to alcohol and other drugs. This report also examines what  is known about other risk factors that may amplify these  effects or produce similar consequences.</p>
<p>The first chapter addresses what the research suggests  about the short- and long-term effects of prenatal exposure  to alcohol and other drugs. </p>
<p>The second chapter discusses environmental factors  which, by themselves or in combination with the effects of  prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, can affect a  child's development.</p>
<p>The third chapter explores the implications for  education in preschool and primary grades and describes  specialized programs that serve children identified as  having been prenatally exposed to alcohol or other drugs, as  well as the behavioral and developmental characteristics  these children display.</p>
<p>Finally, this report sums up the central findings and  suggests ways that this information can guide the  development of strategies, techniques, and materials to help  teachers and administrators provide children at risk with  appropriate and effective educational experiences.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 1:</h2>
<h2>EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUGS</h2>
<p>Research on the extent and effects of prenatal exposure  to alcohol and other drugs is complex and sometimes  contradictory. This chapter contains five major sections. It  begins with a discussion of some important methodological  issues. A second section examines data on the prevalence of  prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs. A third  section summarizes the current research on the effects of  prenatal exposure to five widely used substances:  cocaine,  opiates, amphetamines and methamphetamines, phencyclidine  hydrochloride (PCP), and marijuana, as well as research on "mixed"  samples. Finally, the relationship between maternal use of  alcohol and other drugs and the risk and developmental  consequences of preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA)  birth is examined. This chapter ends with some general  conclusions on the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol  or other drugs.</p>
<h2>METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>The difficulties of research on the extent and effects  of prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs are those  common to any medical research conducted under  nonexperimental conditions, those particular to an  investigation of illegal or disapproved-of activities, and  those particular to an emotionally charged subject. </p>
<p>Some of the methodological challenges include finding an  appropriate sample.  </p>
<ul><li> Most hospitals lack protocols for identifying pregnant  women who use alcohol and/or other drugs; in addition, such  protocols have limited use because people often do not admit  such behavior (McCalla et al. 1992; McNagny and Parker 1992;  Cohen, Green, &amp; Crombleholme 1991; Lurio, Younge, &amp;  Selwyn 1991; Wilkins-Haug &amp; Gabow 1991; GAO 1990; Matera  et al. 1990; Senate Office of Research 1990; Zuckerman et  al. 1989; Zuckerman et al. 1985; Rouse, Kozel, &amp;  Richards 1985; Legislative Analyst n.d.).  </li>
<li> Toxicologic assessments can result in false positives  or fail to reveal alcohol or other drug use because those  substances have metabolized (Mayes et al. 1992; Szeto 1991;  Larsen &amp; Horowitz 1991; Matera et al. 1990; Hawks &amp;  Chiang 1986).  </li>
<li> Researchers frequently fail to base their prevalence  estimates on samples representative of the general  population (Mayes et al. 1992).  </li>
<li> Researchers often have trouble establishing a matched  control group, especially when studying those groups most at  risk of substance abuse (Chasnoff 1991; Strauss &amp; Allred  1986).  </li>
</ul><p>Other problems concern the difficulty of isolating the  effects of a particular substance and determining the  relationship between the effects and both the amount of a  substance used and when it was used during pregnancy.</p>
<ul><li> Researchers find it extremely difficult to control for  the effects of other factors (such as prenatal care or  nutrition) that influence perinatal and developmental  outcomes (Mayes et al. 1992; Frank et al. 1988; Zuckerman &amp;  Hingson 1986; Neugut 1981).  </li>
<li> Polydrug use (including alcohol and tobacco) is common  among women who use drugs (Chasnoff 1991; Streissguth et al.  1991a). Cigarette smoking has been linked to many of the  perinatal and developmental effects also attributed to  illicit drugs and alcohol (Zuckerman 1991b; Fried &amp;  Watkinson 1990; Haglund &amp; Cnattingius 1990; Zuckerman  1988; Abel 1984; Pirani 1978).   </li>
<li> Toxicologic assessments reveal nothing about the  overall pattern of the use of alcohol and other drugs (Day,  Wagener, &amp;  Taylor 1985), and self-reports about this  behavior lack reliability (Wilkins-Haug &amp; Gabow 1991;  Matera et al. 1990; Zuckerman et al. 1985; Rouse, Kozel, &amp;  Richards 1985; Legislative Analyst n.d.). It is possible  that mixtures of illegal drugs, or combinations of illegal  drugs and alcohol, have different effects than the use of a  single substance (Randall 1992a).  </li>
<li> Illicit drugs vary greatly in dosage and purity  (Chasnoff 1991).  </li>
</ul><p>Finally, individual studies and the pool of accessible  research may reflect a bias. Koren et al. (1989), for  example, found that reports concluding that there are  minimal reproductive hazards associated with maternal use of  cocaine were less likely to be accepted for presentation  than reports finding greater hazards, regardless of  methodological rigor. These methodological issues should be  kept in mind when considering estimates of the extent of  prenatal alcohol and other drug exposure and interpreting  research results.</p>
<h2>PREVALENCE </h2>
<p><b>Estimates of the Extent of Prenatal Exposure to  Alcohol and Other Drugs  </b></p>
<p>Prevalence estimates vary. Chasnoff and Griffith (1989)  estimate that 11 percent of all newborns, more than 459,690  children born each year, have been exposed to illicit drugs.  Gomby and Shiono (1991) estimate that more than 739,000  women each year use one or more illegal substances during a  pregnancy.  </p>
<p>The dramatic increase in the popularity of cocaine (and  especially crack) during the late 1980s prompted much of the  contemporary concern with prenatal drug exposure. Estimates  of the percentage of children born prenatally exposed to  cocaine (including crack) each year range from 1 to 4.5  percent (Gomby &amp; Shiono 1991; Besharov 1990; GAO 1990).  Using these rates, it is estimated that women give birth to  between 41,790 and 188,055 children each year who were  exposed to cocaine. (Unless otherwise noted,  National  Center for Health Statistics estimates of live births for  1990 provide the basis for all statistical extrapolations.)</p>
<p>Despite the growing use of cocaine, marijuana remains  the most widely used illicit drug. Rates of newborns  prenatally exposed to marijuana have been estimated at  levels from 3 to almost 20 percent (MacGregor et al. 1990;  Gomby &amp; Shiono 1991; Hingson et al. 1982), which would  indicate that every year women give birth to between 125,370  and 835,800 children prenatally exposed to marijuana. </p>
<p>Prenatal exposure to alcohol far exceeds that of illicit  drugs. Gomby and Shiono (1991) estimate that women give  birth to more than 2.6 million infants exposed to alcohol  each year. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) annually affects  between 1.3 and 2.2 children per 1,000 live births in North  America (US DHHS 1990; Streissguth &amp; Giunta 1988).  Researchers estimate that cases of Alcohol-Related Birth  Defects (ARBD) exceed those of FAS by a ratio of 2:1 to 3:1  (Streissguth &amp; Giunta 1988; Abel &amp; Dintcheff 1984).  This would indicate that women in the U.S. annually give  birth to between 16,548 and 22,064 children exhibiting the  effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. </p>
<p>Other evidence also indicates that the number of  children born exposed to alcohol and other drugs is high.  </p>
<ul><li> 4.5 million (7.7 percent) of the women of childbearing  age in the U.S. have used an illicit drug in the past month,  including 601,000 cocaine users and 3.3 million who have  used marijuana. Many more are heavy drinkers (NIDA, 1991).  </li>
<li> Childbearing-age women comprise the majority of women  who use drugs (Yamaguchi &amp; Kandel 1987).  </li>
<li> Women who use illicit drugs other than marijuana have  a premarital pregnancy rate twice that of those who do not  (Yamaguchi &amp; Kandel 1987).  </li>
<li> The majority of women entering drug treatment programs  have children (Deren 1986).   </li>
</ul><p>Research on a woman's consumption of alcohol and other  drugs, once she knows she is pregnant, is inconclusive.  Factors such as substance, age, socioeconomic status, and  the presence of prenatal care may all affect consumption  (Sarvela &amp; Ford 1992; Poole 1992; Marques &amp; McKnight  1991; Zambrana et al. 1991; Ihlen et al. 1990; Gilchrist,  Gillmore, &amp; Lohr 1990; Pletsch 1988; Johnson, McCarter, &amp;  Ferencz 1987; Eriksson, Steneroth, &amp; Zetterstrom 1986;  Day, Wagener, &amp; Taylor 1985; Fried, Innes, &amp; Barnes  1984). Serdula et al. (1991) found that, while the overall  rate of women who drink during pregnancy declined during the  mid-1980s, the rate among less-educated women or those under  the age of 25 remained the same.</p>
<h2>EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ILLICIT DRUGS</h2>
<p>This review is restricted to drugs with a relatively  substantial body of research data: cocaine, opiates  (primarily heroin and methadone), amphetamine and  methamphetamine, phencyclidine hydrochloride (PCP), and  marijuana.</p>
<p>Animal models have proved useful for the type of  controlled experimental research impossible in humans for  methodological and ethical reasons. Such studies have cast  much light on issues such as placental transfer of drugs,  fetal and intrauterine distribution, fetal drug metabolism,  and pharmacological effects (Rudolph 1985) and can provide  supporting evidence for clinical findings under experimental  conditions (see, for example, Hutchings 1985).</p>
<h2>Cocaine</h2>
<p>Much of the current research on prenatal exposure to  drugs focuses on cocaine.  Despite this, the perinatal and  developmental effects of such exposure remain topics of  controversy.</p>
<p>One study has implicated prenatal exposure to cocaine in  an increased risk of stillbirth (Handler et al. 1991).  Cocaine's involvement in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome  (SIDS), however, remains inconclusive, largely because of  the difficulties in controlling for possible confounding  factors (Bancalari 1991; Durand, Espinoza, &amp; Nickerson  1990; Ward et al. 1990; Chasnoff et al. 1989c; Bauchner et  al. 1988; Riley, Brodsky, &amp; Porat 1988). Some studies  have implied that cocaine may be implicated in irregular  neonatal respiratory patterns that may be related to an  elevated rate of SIDS (McCann &amp; Lewis 1991; Sylvestri et  al. 1991). Other studies question this finding (Zuckerman,  Maynard, Cabral 1991; Kelley, Walsh, &amp; Thompson 1991).</p>
<p>More generalized findings associate prenatal cocaine  exposure to increased risks of</p>
<ul><li> <b>preterm delivery</b> (Feldman et al. 1992; Cohen,  Green, &amp; Crombleholme 1991; Chasnoff 1991; Handler et  al. 1991; Spence et al. 1991; Mastrogiannis et al. 1990;  Dixon 1989; Cherukuri et al. 1988; Finnegan 1988; Chasnoff,  Burns, &amp; Burns 1987; MacGregor et al. 1987)  </li>
<li> <b>abruptio placentae</b>, the premature detachment  of a placenta (Cohen, Green, &amp; Crombleholme 1991;  Dombrowski et al. 1991; Handler et al. 1991; Mastrogiannis  et al. 1990; Dixon 1989; Cherukuri et al. 1988; Chasnoff  1985; Acker et al. 1983)   </li>
<li> <b>meconium staining</b> (Meconium is a term used to  describe the dark green mucilaginous material in the  intestine of the full-term fetus.)  (Mastrogiannis et al.  1990; Livesay et al. 1988)  </li>
<li> <b>smaller-than-normal head size and low birthweight</b>  (Coles et al. 1992; Chasnoff et al. 1992; Cohen, Green, &amp;  Crombleholme 1991; Dombrowski et al. 1991; Kelley, Walsh &amp;  Thompson 1991; McCalla et al. 1991; Handler et al. 1991;  Little &amp; Snell 1991; Petitti &amp; Coleman 1990;  Burkett, Yasin, &amp; Palow 1990; Fulroth, Phillips, &amp;  Durand 1989; Chasnoff et al. 1989a; Zuckerman et al. 1989;  Dixon 1989; Cherukuri et al. 1988; Finnegan 1988; Chouteau,  Namerow, &amp; Leppert 1988; Livesay et al. 1988; LeBlanc et  al. 1987; MacGregor et al. 1987; Oro &amp; Dixon 1987)  </li>
<li> <b>low scores on the Apgar, which assesses the  condition of newborns</b> (Spence et al. 1991; McCalla et  al. 1991; Finnegan 1988)  </li>
<li> <b>disorganized behavioral states in the prenate and  neonate, which may reflect central nervous system damage</b>  (Coles et al. 1992; Magnano, Gardner, &amp; Karmel 1992;  Chasnoff et al. 1989; Dixon 1989; Hume et al. 1989; Chasnoff  &amp; Griffith 1989; Griffith 1988; Doberczak et al. 1988;  Chasnoff, Burns, &amp; Burns 1987)  </li>
</ul><p>One study implies that infants exposed to cocaine in  utero may have an increased risk of motor dysfunction  (Schneider &amp; Chasnoff 1992). Some researchers suggest  that prenatal cocaine exposure can increase the risk of  intravenicular hemorrhages (Dixon &amp; Bejar 1989). Others  maintain that such hemorrhages do not affect cocaine-exposed  neonates at rates differing from the general population  (Sweidan et al. 1990). Questions also exist concerning the  relationship of such hemorrhages to developmental outcomes  (Vohr et al. 1992; Kosofsky 1991; Greenberg &amp; Crnic  1988). Another study of the neurological implications of  prenatal cocaine exposure did indicate that exposure may be  related to Central Nervous System (CNS) abnormalities (Heier  et al. 1991).</p>
<p>Fulroth, Phillips, and Durand (1989) indicated that some  babies prenatally exposed to cocaine undergo withdrawal.  However, a review of the research by Zuckerman (1991b)  concluded that "a withdrawal symptom has not been  identified and, therefore, at this time it is inaccurate to  describe a cocaine-exposed newborn as crack addicted."</p>
<p>While some studies indicate that the effects of prenatal  cocaine exposure (including suspected neurological  abnormalities, low birthweight, and the consequences of  withdrawal) normalize within the first year after birth  (Doberczak et al. 1988; Black &amp; Schuler n.d.),  preliminary reports from one longitudinal study found that  30 to 40 percent of a sample of cocaine-exposed children had  language development and attention problems through at least  their fourth year of life (Griffith 1991, testimony).</p>
<p>The results of the studies summarized in this section  are not entirely consistent. Some studies find effects that  other studies do not (see, for example, Richardson &amp; Day  1991).  At least one study of Canadian social cocaine users  found no effects on perinatal outcomes (Graham et al. 1992).  Such discrepancies are often attributed to differences in  samples, sample size, and the purity and dosage of drugs  used by subjects.</p>
<p>A recent commentary in the <i>Journal of the American  Medical Association  </i> concluded that "available evidence from the  newborn period is far too slim and fragmented to allow any  clear predictions about the effects of intrauterine exposure  to cocaine on the course and outcome of child growth and  development" and that "significantly, no  prospective study of unique long-term consequences of  intrauterine cocaine, nonopiate exposure has been published  in the peer-review literature" (Mayes et al. 1992). A  recent meta-analysis of research on prenatal cocaine  exposure came to similar conclusions (Lutiger 1991).</p>
<h2>Opiates</h2>
<p>While the "crack epidemic" has drawn public  attention away from other drugs, heroin remains a widespread  social problem. Prenatal heroin exposure is associated with</p>
<ul><li> <b>preterm delivery</b> (Maas et al. 1990; Gregg,  Davidson, &amp; Weindling 1988; Finnegan 1988)  </li>
<li> <b>miscarriages</b> (Suffet &amp; Brotman 1984)  </li>
<li> <b>smaller-than-normal head size and low birthweight</b>  (Fulroth, Phillips, &amp; Durand 1989; Zuckerman et al.  1989; Pasto et al. 1988; Householder et al. 1982; Stimmel et  al. 1982)  </li>
<li> <b>meconium staining</b> (Pasto et al. 1988;  Householder et al. 1982)  </li>
</ul><p>Some evidence associates heroin with an increased risk  for SIDS (McCance-Katz 1991; Deren 1986; Householder et al.  1982).</p>
<p>The majority of babies born to women addicted to heroin  (or on methadone maintenance) suffer from neonatal  abstinence syndrome. (McCance-Katz 1991; Mas et al. 1990;  Fulroth, Phillips, &amp; Durand 1989; Rosen &amp; Johnson  1985). This condition includes neurologic signs (hypertonia,  tremors, sleep disturbances, seizures), autonomic nervous  system dysfunctions, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and  respiratory problems (Hoegerman &amp; Schnoll 1991).</p>
<p>Some long-term studies indicate that children prenatally  exposed to heroin suffer from below-average weight and  length, adjustment problems, and psycholinguistic and other  ability deficits through six years of age (and, in Olofsson  et al. [1983] through age 10) (Deren 1986; Olofsson et al.  1983; Wilson et al. 1979).</p>
<p>However, as with much of the research on prenatal drug  exposure, many of the cognitive and behavioral effects could  result from confounding environmental influences. One review  of the literature on opiates concluded that: "In  general, [the infants of opiate-addicted women] have a  number of behavioral disturbances early in life, but lasting  cognitive-developmental differences between these children  and controls have not regularly been found" (Strauss &amp;  Allred 1986).</p>
<p>Studies of prenatal methadone exposure report some  association with initial developmental deficits. Researchers  have not identified consistent long-term effects of prenatal  methadone exposure and speculate that these effects largely  depend on a combination of biologic and environmental  factors (Rosen &amp; Johnson 1985; Chasnoff 1985; Johnson,  Rosen, &amp; Glassman 1983).</p>
<p>Methadone maintenance programs result in improved birth  outcomes for addicted women (Maas et al. 1990; Stimmel et  al. 1982; Ramer &amp; Lodge 1975). Such programs often  include improved prenatal and medical care, as well as  improved maternal nutrition, which suggests that some of the  consequences of prenatal opiate exposure result from a lack  of prenatal care and poor maternal health rather than  represent a direct effect of the drug.  </p>
<h2>Amphetamines and Methamphetamines</h2>
<p>Some of the research on the prenatal effects of  amphetamines or methamphetamines demonstrates perinatal  results similar to those found in studies of cocaine or  heroin.  However, most researchers express reservations  concerning their inability to control for the effects of  variables such as poor prenatal care or foster-care  placement (Dixon 1989; Little, Snell, &amp; Gilstrap 1988;  Eriksson, Larsson, &amp; Zetterstrom 1981; Billing et al.  1980).  </p>
<p>In one study of eight year olds whose mothers had abused  amphetamines during pregnancy, Eriksson et al. (1989) did  not find any significant differences from children whose  mothers had not used drugs, on measures of physical health  (including growth), IQ, and performance on psychometric  tests. This research team suggested that the differences  found (including increased levels of aggression and problems  relating to peers) may result from socioenvironmental  factors. (See also Little, Snell, &amp; Gilstrap 1988 for a  report of no effects.) Thus, although some of the research  indicates that prenatal exposure to amphetamines or  methamphetamines may have some short-term consequences for  the neonate, most of the research on this group of drugs  remains inconclusive.  </p>
<h2>Phencyclidine Hydrochloride (PCP)</h2>
<p>The research on prenatal exposure to PCP describes a  number of consequences, including intrauterine growth  retardation, preterm delivery, neonatal withdrawal, meconium  staining, and poor consolability. Neurobehavioral symptoms  associated with prenatal exposure to PCP include  irritability, tremors, jitteriness, extreme sensitivity to  stimuli, poor visual tracking, and hypertonicity (Tabor,  Smith-Wallace, &amp; Yonekura 1990; Howard, Kropenske, &amp;  Tyler 1986; Golden et al. 1984; Chasnoff et al. 1983;  Strauss, Modanlou, &amp; Bosu 1981). With one exception,  these studies take the form of case reports with severely  limited sample sizes (one to seven infants) and a lack of  controls for other variables (most notably, the mother's  heavy consumption of other substances). </p>
<h2>Marijuana</h2>
<p>Much of the research on the prenatal effects of  marijuana has associated heavy use with the following:</p>
<ul><li> <b>low birthweight</b> (Zuckerman et al. 1989; Kline,  Stein, &amp; Hutzler 1987; Fried et al. 1987; Hatch &amp;  Bracken 1986)  </li>
<li><b>a shortened gestational period</b> (Fried,  Watkinson, &amp; Willan 1984)  </li>
<li><b>meconium staining and complications in delivery</b>  (Greenland et al. 1982)  </li>
<li><b>neonatal neurobiological abnormalities</b> (Lester &amp;  Dreher 1989; Fried 1985)  </li>
</ul><p>Differences between children of marijuana-using and  nonusing mothers often disappear when demographic  characteristics and other confounding factors are controlled  for (O'Connell &amp; Fried 1991; Linn et al. 1983; Gibson,  Bayhurst, &amp; Collry 1983). For example, Fried (1985)  found no significant differences between matched  marijuana-using and nonusing samples in terms of miscarriage  rates, birth presentations, Apgar scores, and frequency of  birth complications or major abnormalities. (See also Day et  al. [1991] and Abel [1985] for lack of consequential  effects.)</p>
<p>Fried and Watkinson (1990) reported that:</p>
<p>At 48 months, significantly lower scores in verbal and  memory domains were associated with maternal marijuana use  after adjusting for confounding variables.  This negative  relationship is the first reported association beyond the  prenatal stage, and may represent a long-term effect of the  drug upon complex behavior that, at a younger age, had not  developed and/or could not be assessed.</p>
<p>Contradictory findings resulting from the research on  prenatal exposure to marijuana may arise from an inability  to control dosage and the purity (and strength) of the  marijuana being used. (See, for example, the discussion of  comparative results in Tennes et al. [1985]).  </p>
<h2>Mixed Samples of Illicit Drug Users</h2>
<p>Studies of samples composed of a mix of users of  cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, and PCP tend to  replicate the generalized findings of studies of individual  drugs. Ward et al. (1990) suggested that abnormal sleeping  ventilatory patterns in the infants of mothers who abuse  alcohol and other drugs may increase the risk of SIDS.  However, this study also confirmed the difficulties of  eliminating the effects of confounding variables revealed in  some of the drug-specific studies. Still, there are other  studies that link prenatal substance exposure to respiratory  difficulties (McCann &amp; Lewis 1991). </p>
<p>Other adverse effects found in mixed samples include  increased rates of low birthweight, small birth size, and  signs of neurobehavioral disturbances (Dominquez et al.  1991; Van Baar et al. 1989; Gillogley et al. 1990; Kaye et  al. 1989; Dixon &amp; Bejar 1989; Fulroth, Phillips, &amp;  Durand 1989; Oro &amp; Dixon 1987; Chasnoff 1985). Some of  these studies also seem to substantiate the finding that  most consequences of prenatal drug exposure resolve within a  year (Van Baar, Fleury, &amp; Ultee 1989;  Chasnoff 1985),  although some </p>
<p>indicated the possibility of longer-term language  acquisition difficulties (Van Baar 1990; Rodning, Beckwith,  &amp; Howard 1989). </p>
<h2>EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL</h2>
<p>Research implicates alcohol in a wide range of perinatal  effects including:  </p>
<ul><li><b>an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and  stillbirth</b> (Abel 1981)  </li>
<li><b>shorter gestation periods</b> (Hingson et al. 1982)  </li>
<li><b>reduced birth size and weight</b> (Autti-Ramo &amp;  Granstrom 1991)  </li>
</ul><p>Researchers normally divide the long-term effects of  prenatal exposure to alcohol into two categories: (1) Fetal  Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and (2) Alcohol-Related Birth Defects  (ARBD, sometimes called Fetal Alcohol Effects or FAE).</p>
<h2>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</h2>
<p>In 1973, K.L. Jones, D.W. Smith, and their colleagues  realized that a substantial number of children affected by  prenatal exposure to alcohol exhibited a characteristic set  of facial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, and  psychomotor disorders. They labelled this characteristic  covariance Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) (Jones et al. 1973).  Since that time, researchers have developed a number of  competing diagnostic definitions for FAS (Weiner &amp; Morse  1988; Burd &amp; Martsolf 1989; Clarren &amp; Smith 1978).  The Fetal Alcohol Study Group of the Research Society on  Alcoholism (Rosett 1980) requires the presence of signs in  each of three categories:</p>
<ul><li><b>prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation</b>  (weight, length, and/or head circumference below the tenth  percentile corrected for gestational age)  </li>
<li><b>central nervous system involvement</b> (indications  of neurological abnormality, developmental delay, or  intellectual impairment)  </li>
<li> <b>facial abnormalities</b> (with at least two of the  following signs: head circumference below the third  percentile; narrow eye slits; flat and long upper lip;  underdeveloped midface; and flattened nose bridge)   </li>
</ul><p>The FAS facial features described above create a  characteristic look that has been described by other  researchers as well (Russell 1991; Jessup &amp; Green 1987;  Nelson et al. 1990; Umbreit &amp; Ostrow 1980; Overholser  1990; US DHHS 1990; McCance-Katz 1991).  While these facial  anomalies appear less pronounced over time, deficits and  impairments in the other categories do not. Victims of FAS  never catch up in size or cognitive ability to their  nonaffected peers (Streissguth et al. 1991b; US DHHS 1990;  Jessup &amp; Green 1987; Streissguth, Clarren, &amp; Jones  1985; Rosett &amp; Weiner 1984; Iosub et al. 1981;  Streissguth, Herman, &amp; Smith 1978a,b; Hanson, Jones, &amp;  Smith 1976).</p>
<p>Other physical abnormalities associated with FAS include  cardiovascular problems, cardiac murmurs, kidney troubles,  respiratory dysfunction, hernias, shortened fingers, and  profusion of facial hair (Burd &amp; Martsolf 1989; Holzman  1983; Weiner &amp; Morse 1988).  Delayed motor development  also characterizes many children with FAS and, in many  cases, motor development never normalizes (Sparks 1984;  Warren &amp; Bast 1988). Physical abnormalities related to  FAS can affect linguistic and cognitive development.  Abnormal palates and other oral structures can cause  articulation difficulties (Iosub et al. 1981). A significant  proportion of children with FAS have impaired vision and/or  hearing (Stromland 1987; Streissguth &amp; Giunta 1988;  Church &amp; Gerkin 1988), which can affect learning  ability.</p>
<p>Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders related to FAS  include acute sensitivity to sound, irritability, little  body activity, attention problems, and jitteriness (Pierog,  Chandavasu, &amp; Wexler 1977; Streissguth &amp; Giunta  1988).</p>
<p>Cognitive impairments associated with FAS include  deficits in the ability to use and comprehend language and  process and store information (Becker, Warr-Leeper, &amp;  Leeper 1990). Streissguth, Herman, and Smith (1978a,b) found  that children with FAS had IQ scores ranging from normal to  severely mentally retarded, with a mean score of 65. These  scores do not appear to improve over time (Streissguth,  Randels, &amp; Smith 1991). FAS may surpass Down syndrome  and spina bifida as a leading cause of mental retardation  (Abel &amp; Sokol 1987; Abel &amp; Sokol 1986a; CDC 1982;  Clarren &amp; Smith 1978; Jones &amp; Smith 1973). </p>
<p>Research shows that FAS results from chronic maternal  drinking (although not all women who drink heavily during  their pregnancy produce children with FAS) (Weiner &amp;  Morse 1988; US DHHS 1987; Abel 1985; Streissguth &amp;  Martin 1983). The effects of </p>
<p>limited social drinking by pregnant women remain a  subject of controversy (Autti-Ramo &amp; Granstrom 1991;  Russel 1991; Overholser 1990; Ernhart et al. 1989; Warren &amp;  Bast 1988; Jessup &amp; Green 1987; Abel 1984; Lochry et al.  1982; Edwards 1979).</p>
<h2>Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD)/Fetal Alcohol  Effects (FAE)</h2>
<p>Researchers have estimated that, among the children  prenatally exposed to alcohol, the number suffering  potentially severe developmental effects without diagnostic  signs of FAS is twice the number of those with FAS  indicators (Streissguth &amp; Giunta 1988; Weiner &amp;  Morse 1988). These effects include alcohol-related physical  features (alcohol dysmorphia), growth retardation, and  various cognitive deficits (Coles et al. 1991) and may  represent the effects of lower levels of alcohol consumption  by the mother, different usage patterns, the influence of  confounding factors, and/or genetic differences in  susceptibility.  </p>
<p>Failure to take account of FAE underestimates the  dangers of alcohol use for pregnant women and their  children. Barr et al. (1990) found that prenatal exposure to  alcohol affected fine and gross motor performance at four  years of age. The same research team discovered that social  and binge drinking "predicts a pattern of  neurobehavioral deficit that includes attention and memory  deficits . . . a variety of 'process' variables reflecting  poor integration and quality of responses; behavior patterns  involving distractibility and poor organization; and an  inflexible approach to problem solving (Streissguth et al.  1989 a,b;  See also Sampson et al. 1989). This research also  revealed that consumption of an average of two drinks a day  by pregnant women was related to a seven-point decrease in  IQ at age seven. However, they noted that environmental  factors were associated with outcomes and "these  patterns should not be interpreted as biologic thresholds"  (Streissguth, Barr, &amp; Sampson 1990).</p>
<h2>PRETERM AND SMALL-FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE (SGA) BIRTH</h2>
<p>The research shows that:</p>
<p>Low birthweight is the most frequent and clearly  documented adverse outcome associated with gestational  exposure to narcotics and other toxic addictive substances  including nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. While  decreased birthweight can be attributed primarily to  impaired fetal growth, an increased occurrence of premature  birth, as reported with maternal use of heroin and cocaine,  may also play a role (Lifschitz &amp; Wilson 1991).</p>
<p>If prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs elevates  the risk of preterm or small-for-gestational-age (SGA)  birth, then it also elevates any consequent perinatal or  developmental risks. </p>
<h2>Risk Factors for Preterm and SGA Birth</h2>
<p>Many factors in addition to drug and alcohol consumption  contribute to an elevated risk of preterm and SGA births.  These include stress, low weight, age, inadequate prenatal  care, hypertension, poor nutrition, and smoking (National  Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality 1990; Hughes et al.  1988; National Center for Health Statistics 1988; Samuels  1986). Except in extreme cases (such as chronic  malnutrition), the interaction and complexity of these risk  factors makes it difficult to identify an individual cause  for specific cases of preterm or SGA birth (Cassady &amp;  Strange 1987; Holmes, Nagy Reich, &amp; Pasternack 1984).</p>
<p>The 1980s saw an increase in the risk factors that  contribute to preterm and SGA birth. The percentage of women  who received no prenatal care increased by half. The number  of infants born to unmarried women rose by 40 percent  (National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality 1990). The  National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality concluded  that the concentration of extreme poverty, drug use,  inadequate health care, and other factors have turned some  communities into "infant mortality disaster areas"  (National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality 1990).</p>
<p>Prenatal care can reduce the risks of preterm or SGA  birth even in the presence of these risk factors (Hughes et  al. 1988). As Margaret Boone (1989) wrote in her study of  infant mortality and morbidity in America:  "Prenatal  care emerges as a critical element. . . . The inner-city  women who obtain care clearly have infants with higher  birthweight than women who do not get care, regardless of  any other characteristics."</p>
<p>Evidence also exists that improved prenatal and neonatal  care can alleviate many of the effects of prenatal drug or  alcohol exposure (Broekhuizen, Utrie, &amp; Van Mullem 1992;  Feldman et al. 1992; Randall 1991; Greene et al. 1991;  Griesbach &amp; Polloway 1990; MacGregor et al. 1989;  Finnegan 1988; Bingol et al. 1987; Fitzsimmons et al. 1986;  Suffet &amp; Brotman 1984; Rosner, Keith, &amp; Chasnoff  1982). However, women who abuse drugs and alcohol tend to  receive less prenatal care than others (Abma &amp; Mott  1991; McCalla et al. 1991; Kelley, Walsh, &amp; Thompson  1991; Burkett, Yasin, &amp; Palow 1990; Matera et al. 1990;  Dixon 1989; Keith, MacGregor, &amp; Sciarra 1988; Cherukuri  et al. 1988).  </p>
<p><b>Perinatal and Long-Term Risks Associated with  Preterm and SGA Birth</b>  </p>
<p>Infants born too soon or too small can face serious and  fatal threats, including elevated risks of Respiratory  Distress Syndrome, intrauterine hypoxia, birth asphyxia,  perinatal infections, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  Low-birthweight infants die in the neonatal period at a rate  40 times that of other infants and represent two-thirds of  all neonatal deaths in the United States (Samuels 1986; also  see Overpeck, Hoffman, &amp; Prager, [1992]). Other  perinatal risks associated with preterm and SGA birth  include nutritional disturbances, intraventricular  hemorrhaging, and meconium staining (Werthmann 1981). All of  these risks have also been attributed to prenatal drug or  alcohol exposure and demonstrate the difficulty of  determining the precise causal linkages between prenatal  risk factors and postnatal status.</p>
<p>Some evidence exists that preterm and SGA birth  (especially in cases of very low birthweight) can result in  subtle cognitive and language acquisition delays and  impairments and differences in IQ (Hack et al. 1991; Largo  et al. 1986; Aylward et al. 1989; Wilson 1985; Cohen &amp;  Parmelee 1983; Hunt 1981). Whether these differences mean  anything in terms of a child's actual linguistic and  cognitive abilities remains unclear. Some studies indicate  that preterm and very SGA birth can have consequences  throughout childhood (Smedler et al. 1992; McCormick et al.  1992; Menyuk et al. 1991; Hoy et al. 1992; Seidman et al.  1992; Lagerstrom et al. 1991a; Lagerstrom et al. 1991b;  Ross, Lipper, &amp; Auld 1991; Lagerstrom et al. 1991c; Hack  et al. 1991; Saigal et al. 1991).  Most studies agree that  preterm and SGA birth have little, if any, long-term effects  on intelligence, language skills, or temperament (Casiro, et  al. 1991; Ludman et al. 1987; Wilson 1985; Greenberg &amp;  Crnic 1988; Menyuk et al. 1991; Watt 1987; Riese 1988;  Oberklaid, Prior, Sanson 1986). Sameroff (1981) concluded  that:</p>
<p>The single most potent factor influencing developmental  outcome turns out to be the cultural environment of the  child, as expressed in socioeconomic status and parental  education level. . . . In all the studies there was a  significant overlap between the outcomes for the preterm  groups and the control groups. No single factor, either  birthweight alone or accompanying physical problems, clearly  predicted a specific developmental outcome.</p>
<p>Another review stated that "the major biological  markers of prematurity made little direct contribution in  predicting their later developmental status" (Greenberg  &amp; Crnic 1988). The fact that early postnatal  intervention can make major differences in the developmental  outcomes of preterm and SGA infants (Brooks-Gunn, Liaw, &amp;  Klebanov 1992; Infant Health and Development Program 1990;  Achenbach et al. 1990) provides additional evidence for the  strength of environmental, rather than biologic, factors.</p>
<p>Social factors can predict the long-term developmental  performance of preterm and SGA children better than biologic  indicators (Carter et al. 1992; Cohen et al. 1986; Cohen &amp;  Parmelee 1983). The poor suffer the consequences of  vulnerable birth status more than those of higher income.  The developmental deficits that normalize by school age in  most children tend to persist longer in those from  low-income families (Largo et al. 1986; Wilson 1985).  Beckwith (1984) found that the developmental scores of  preterm children born to middle-class families and families  of higher socioeconomic status improved as the child  progressed to school age, while those of lower socioeconomic  status children actually declined. This decline may be  associated with biologic risks in the infant's postnatal  environment, such as inadequate nutrition, lead poisoning,  and lack of access to health care. However, the research  also shows that preterm or SGA birth itself affects an  infant's relationship with its parents in ways that have  developmental consequences.</p>
<h2>Preterm and SGA Birth and Parent-Child Interaction</h2>
<p>Beckwith (1984) identified three elements essential for  normal infant development:</p>
<ul><li>verbal interaction  </li>
<li>mutual visual regard  </li>
<li>parents' rapid response to the infant's indication of  stress  </li>
</ul><p>A lack of such stimulation and interaction can have  profound consequences for cognitive and linguistic  development (Holmes, Nagy Reich, &amp; Pasternack 1984;  Cohen, Beckwith, &amp; Parmelee 1978; Rocissano &amp;  Yatchmink 1983). Infants behave in ways that stimulate  caretakers to pick them up, cuddle them, and provide verbal  interaction, mutual visual regard, and response to stress.  But babies born preterm, SGA, or with the neonatal  abstinence syndrome often undergo extensive stays in  hospital neonatal intensive care units and cannot interact  easily with their caregivers (Mundal et al. 1991).</p>
<p>The high-risk infant is forced to spend his initial  weeks or months in an environment that is not only  overstimulating, but disorganized. It is an environment  characterized by few contingencies between the behavior of  the infant and environmental response. . . . There are many  reasons to believe that such an environment is far from  optimal for infant development and may be responsible for  some of the behavioral deficits observed in these children  (Holmes, Nagy Reich, &amp; Pasternack 1984).</p>
<p>Like many of the other factors that can delay neonatal  development, the effects on the infant of a stay in a  neonatal intensive care unit seem to dissipate after six  months. However, the effects of this experience on parents  seem longer-lived. Spungen and Farran (1986) concluded that  a stay by a preterm infant in a neonatal intensive care unit  "was more pervasive on parents' perceptions of their  infants" than on the infants themselves. Seeing a very  small and fragile-looking infant hooked to a maze of wires  and tubes in an incubator may frighten parents. They resist  emotional involvement with a child who they believe may  suffer some irreparable damage. Their perception of the  child's fragile condition may result in a reluctance to pick  up the infant unless absolutely necessary (Holmes, Nagy  Reich, &amp; Pasternack 1984).  </p>
<p>Preterm babies sleep more than fullterm babies. This  allows them to complete some of the development that should  have taken place in the womb. However, while asleep they do  not demand the attention and interaction necessary for  normal development (Holmes, Nagy Reich, &amp; Pasternack  1984).</p>
<p>Having a preterm or SGA infant places a great deal of  stress upon parents, especially mothers. They need higher  levels of formal and informal support than other parents  (Affeckt 1986). The presence or absence of this support can  have critical consequences for parental interaction and  child development. </p>
<p>Crnic, Greenberg, and Slough (1986) found that "early  stress was associated with less positive maternal attitudes  and mother-infant interactive behavior, as well as less  secure infant attachment to the mother." They also  found that "intimate support provided by the mother's  spouse or partner was the most powerful predictor with the  greatest breadth of effect across both mother and infant  functioning" and that professional support has profound  consequences for parenting and infant development.</p>
<p>Mothers of preterm and SGA infants often receive  increased levels of support from husbands, relatives,  friends, and medical professionals. However, single, poor  women often lack such a support system (Beckman et al.  1986). Thus, the same group of women faces both an elevated  risk of giving birth to a preterm or SGA infant and an  increased chance that postnatal factors will compromise the  child's long-term developmental status. Research indicates  that the presence or absence of such support can be critical  for family-child relations and child health outcomes  (Saylor, Lippa, &amp; Lee 1991).</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>While precise data is lacking, it appears that a fairly  substantial number of women use alcohol and other drugs  during their pregnancies. Many of these women face  additional biologic risks to the health of their babies  because of inadequate prenatal care and other risk factors  associated with poverty and chronic abuse of alcohol and  other drugs.</p>
<p>Methodological challenges make it difficult to  investigate the consequences of prenatal drug and alcohol  exposure. The research has demonstrated that:</p>
<ul><li>The use of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to Fetal  Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and other permanent physical and  cognitive defects.  </li>
<li>Heroin, and possibly other illicit drugs, can result in  the neonatal abstinence syndrome. While the long-term  effects of this condition remain uncertain, it places  substantial stress on both the infant and parents and  requires extensive and expensive medical care.  </li>
<li>Prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs may  contribute to a risk of other adverse perinatal outcomes and  developmental delays. The extent of this contribution and  the duration of these delays remain uncertain.  </li>
<li>Prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs can  contribute to preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA)  birth. Other factors that elevate the risk of preterm and  SGA birth tend to concentrate in those sociodemographic  groups that also have an elevated risk of prenatal drug and  alcohol exposure.  </li>
<li>Preterm and SGA birth associated with, or independent  of, prenatal drug or alcohol exposure can have developmental  consequences. Socioeconomic factors, and especially the  extent of prenatal care, predict the extent of these  consequences far better than biologic birth status.  </li>
</ul><p>The risks to infant development do not end with the  neonatal period. As Chasnoff et al. (1992) wrote:</p>
<p>The long-term effects which will be found within the  general population of drug-exposed children will not be  explained by drug exposure alone. Before we can predict the  developmental outcomes for these high-risk children we need  further research into the additive and interactive effects  of the multiple risk factors to which they are exposed,  including in many cases the global effects of poverty,  multigenerational substance abuse, and the impact of growing  up in a drug-seeking environment.</p>
<p>The next chapter of this monograph will explore these  multiple risk factors and their effects on child  development.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 2:</h2>
<h2>  ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>As seen in the previous chapter, research evidence on  the developmental effects of prenatal drug exposure is  sparse, but recent evidence indicates that drug-exposed  children are generally not as impaired as early reports had  predicted. Drug exposure is only one of many factors that  may negatively affect a child's development.</p>
<p>Researchers and scholars have been steadily moving  toward an ecological approach to understanding the complex  factors that contribute to child development (Belsky 1980;  Bronfenbrenner 1979; Gabarino 1990; Kaltenbach &amp;  Finnegan 1984; Sameroff &amp; Chandler 1975; Sameroff &amp;  Fiese 1990). The complex interaction of individual, family,  environment, and community is most evident when one attempts  to understand the dynamics of alcohol and other drug abuse,  particularly as they affect children.</p>
<p>Researchers widely recognize that, as Dr. Barry  Zuckerman states, "The outcome of children of heavy  drug-using parents is due to the dynamic interaction of the  child and the social environment" (Zuckerman 1991a).  Practitioners, too, are keenly aware of the environment and  its influence on children's development. "Parents in  prison, inadequate health care and parenting skills, abuse  and neglect, and multiple foster placements are among the  many environmental factors that children encounter. How can  we possibly say that these children's behaviors are a direct  result of the prenatal drug exposure?" asks Carol Cole,  former teacher in the PED (Children Prenatally Exposed to  Drugs) Program in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>To fully understand the effects of exposure to drugs on  children, it is essential to examine the environmental  factors present in at-risk communities. Below is a review of  literature that addresses the nature of the caregiving  environment in families in which alcohol and other drugs are  abused, the effects of foster care, and the known  developmental consequences of child abuse and neglect.</p>
<h2>CHILDREN, POVERTY, AND VIOLENCE</h2>
<p>More children live in poverty than ever before. Between  1979 and 1989, the number of poor children under age six  increased by 46 percent, even though the total population of  six year olds remained relatively stable. The picture is  even bleaker for children of color. Half of all black  children under six and 40 percent of all Hispanic children  under six are poor. Thirty percent of children in central  cities are poor. Of these, 61 percent live in areas of  concentrated poverty (National Center for Children in  Poverty 1991).</p>
<p>It is in the poor, inner-city communities that much of  the client base exists for the programs that currently  report new and troubling behaviors among their children. But  even more disruptive are two interrelated environmental  stresses to which children growing up in at-risk  neighborhoods are exposed:  drug trafficking and violence.</p>
<p>The relationship between violence and poverty has been  thoroughly documented (Williams 1984; Centerwall 1984;  Loftin &amp; Hill 1974; Parker &amp; Smith 1979; Wilson  1987). Urban areas, especially inner cities, tend to have  much higher rates of interpersonal violence than do rural  and suburban communities (American Psychological Association  1993). Areas that are both poor and urban are thus in double  jeopardy.</p>
<p>Alcohol and other drugs play a major role in the levels  of violence that exist in these communities. At least half  of all the perpetrators and victims of homicides in America  have been drinking, and a large percentage of violence  occurs in places where alcohol is consumed (University of  California/Centers for Disease Control 1985). </p>
<p>One consequence of drug use and drug traffic is the high  rate of associated neighborhood crime (Gropper 1985). The  National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates conservatively  that at least 10 percent of homicides and assaults in the  United States are drug related (Harwood et al. 1984). Other  studies have demonstrated that violent crime and drug abuse  tend to occur in the same neighborhoods; also, users of  certain types of illicit drugs tend to be arrested for  serious crimes against persons at a far greater rate than do  persons who do not use those drugs (McBride et al. 1986).  Sixty percent of those arrested in Washington D.C. in 1988  tested positive for cocaine and 40 percent for PCP (Molotsky  1988).</p>
<p>Because drugs such as heroin and cocaine are both  illegal and valuable, their marketing involves considerable  violence: violence among drug dealers over turf, violence  between dealers and their customers over price and quality,  violence between dealers and those who see them as robbery  targets, and violence among drug users over drugs. </p>
<h2>Effects of Violence on Children's Development</h2>
<p>From an early age, children in at-risk neighborhoods  witness violence and crime close to home. Living with the  fear of violence in school, in neighborhoods, and at home  takes its toll on the development of children, even if they  have not been physically injured.</p>
<p>Dr. Barry Zuckerman describes the symptoms that may  emerge in children who witness violence:  "a diminished  ability to concentrate in school because of intrusive  thoughts and images; persistent sleep disturbances;  disordered attachment behaviors with significant caretakers;  nihilistic, fatalistic orientation to the future which leads  to increased risk-taking behaviors" (Zuckerman 1991a).</p>
<p>While not enough research has been done on the extent to  which preschool-aged children in inner-city neighborhoods  are aware of this violence, anecdotal evidence and some  studies have shown that it does not go unnoticed by older  children. A study of fourth through sixth graders from  low-income neighborhood schools in Washington D.C. revealed  that almost 30 percent had witnessed at least one incidence  of community violence. Almost 16 percent had witnessed  shootings and over a quarter had witnessed gang violence.  Forty percent of the parents said that their children had  witnessed at least one violent episode (Hill 1991).</p>
<p>Twenty-four percent of 168 Baltimore adolescents  visiting an inner-city clinic for routine medical care had  witnessed a murder, 72 percent knew someone who had been  shot, and all had been victims of violence (Zinmeister  1990). Ninety percent of children using the psychiatric  clinic at the King/Drew Medical Clinic in South-Central Los  Angeles have witnessed violence (Timnick 1989).</p>
<p>The available evidence indicates that such violence can  take a toll upon the development, behavior, and emotional  well-being of children who are exposed to it. Children in  violence-infected neighborhoods have begun to display the  symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, including  depression, violent outbursts, difficulty concentrating, and  reduced involvement in the outside world (Pynoos &amp; Eth  1985; Kristal 1982; Landers 1990). Research has begun to  document the effects of witnessing violence on child  development, which include impaired cognition, memory and  learning disorders, and poor school performance (Garbarino,  Kostelny, &amp; Dubrow 1991). These effects bear a striking  resemblance to those often attributed to prenatal drug  exposure.</p>
<h2><b>FAMILIES IN WHICH ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS ARE  ABUSED:  THE CAREGIVING ENVIRONMENT</b></h2>
<p>Whether or not they live in at-risk communities,  children who live in families abusing alcohol and other  drugs are exposed to more immediate risks. The quality of  the caregiving environment, reflected in family discord,  stability, and status, has been related to children's  development in study after study (Sameroff, Barocas, &amp;  Seiffer 1984; Goldstein &amp; Tuma 1987). Emerging research  on resiliency suggests that neither prenatal exposure to  drugs nor poverty can, in itself, predict the developmental  outcomes (Werner 1990; Johnson et al. 1990; Leif 1985).  However, without support and intervention, the prospects for  children from families in which alcohol and other drugs are  abused are not promising. </p>
<h2>Substance Abuse and the Ability to Fulfill Parental  Roles</h2>
<p>Many factors detract from the capacity of women abusing  alcohol and other drugs to be the kind of mothers they want  to be. Howard (1989) found that many women who abuse drugs  and/or alcohol were themselves victims of physical, sexual,  and emotional abuse as children. Among the 58 women Howard  studied, 72 percent had been physically and/or sexually  abused, 66 percent came from households where one or both  parents used drugs, 55 percent had multiple caretakers while  growing up, and over 74 percent experienced violent episodes  during their lifetimes. </p>
<p>Substance abuse results in behaviors that are in  conflict with secure and nurturing caregiving: social  isolation; poor coping skills; and difficulty in managing  finances, accessing community resources, making child-care  arrangements, or pursuing vocational and educational  activities (Leif 1985;  Zuckerman 1991a; Pearlman et al.  1982; West &amp; Dalton 1982). Some research has tied  alcohol and drug abuse directly to an increased risk of  child abuse and neglect (Wright et al 1991; Rose 1991).</p>
<h2>Child-Rearing Challenges and Parents' Behaviors</h2>
<p>The challenges begin even before the hospital stay is  over. Faced with a "difficult baby" at birth,  mothers may be upset by the child's high-pitched cries,  restlessness, irritability, spitting up, and need for  frequent feedings. Once home, children "often  experience inconsistent parenting, with their mother  behaving one way when she is high and another when she is  straight" (Leif 1985). Parents may ignore an infant's  signals for stimulation and nutrition, as they lack an  understanding of children's needs for routines in daily  life. As researchers from the Family Center at Jefferson  Medical College note, "If a woman is using additional  drugs [other than methadone] which have a soporific effect,  she may neglect to feed her child on time, keep an infant  dry and clean, and if, at the time, she is withdrawing, she  may also be irritable and abusive" (Regan, Ehrlich, &amp;  Finnegan 1987). </p>
<p>Parents who abuse alcohol and other drugs may also lack  practical skills such as reading a thermometer,  administering medication, and preparing nutritious meals  (Howard 1989; Leif 1985; Zuckerman 1991a, 1991b; Howard &amp;  Kropenske 1990; Fiks, Johnson, &amp; Rosen 1985). They often  have difficulty learning the importance of interacting with  their child and are often unaware of the child's  psychological needs. Their lack of understanding of child  development can lead to unrealistic expectations. For  example, they may interpret a toddler's eager exploration of  the world as "misbehaving." These unrealistic  expectations can generate rigid rules and a negative style  of interrelating with their children (Bauman &amp; Levine  1986).</p>
<p>The effects of poor childrearing skills can produce  and/or amplify the types of developmental consequences  associated with prenatal drug exposure (Sher et al. 1991;  Kronstadt 1991; Johnson, Boney, &amp; Brown 1990-1991; Burns  &amp; Clark 1991; Johnson &amp; Rosen 1990; Howard 1989;  Howard et al. 1989; Griffith 1988; Jeremy &amp; Bernstein  1984; Bauman 1980; Leif 1985). </p>
<p>It is a mistake, however, to conclude that all mothers  who use alcohol and other drugs uniformly provide inadequate  care. As Leif reports, "The stereotyped image of the  inadequate addict parent is not necessarily the true  picture."  With support, many mothers can retain  custody, prove themselves capable of learning about  developmental issues, and respond to the needs of the  growing infant. Unfortunately, without the intensive support  needed, many are unable to care for their own children.   </p>
<h2>FOSTER CARE </h2>
<p>Many infants who are prenatally exposed to drugs never  go home with their parents and are placed in the foster care  system at birth. In a study of 10 hospitals, an estimated  1,200 of the 4,000 drug-exposed infants born in 1989 were  placed in foster care (GAO 1990). Even if drug-exposed  infants remain in the care of their families after birth,  many enter the social services system later, because of the  chaotic and often dangerous environment associated with  parental drug abuse (GAO 1990).  </p>
<p>There has been a dramatic rise in the number of foster  care placements coinciding with the rise of crack cocaine  use in the mid- and late-1980s. The estimated demand for  foster care nationwide increased 29 percent between 1986 and  1989; however, the demand for placement for children under  age 6 rose approximately 40 percent (GAO 1990). There have  been regional reports that indicate increases in foster care  placements by 80 to 235 percent since 1985 (State  Interagency Task Force on Perinatal Substance Abuse 1991;  Norris 1991).  </p>
<p>Infants living with caretakers who abuse substances face  a special set of vulnerabilities and risks. According to the  U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Children,  Youth and Families, "Increasing numbers of infants are  being born drug-exposed, placing them at particular risk of  the multiple problems that lead to out-of-home care"  (Report of the Select Committee 1989). Families abusing  alcohol and other drugs, whose children are placed in foster  homes, are more likely than other families with children in  foster care to include mothers with less education, to be  poorly housed, and to receive Aid to Families with Dependent  Children (AFDC) prior to placement (Walker, Zangrillo, &amp;  Smith 1991). Additionally, children from families in which  alcohol and other drugs are abused are more likely to enter  the foster-care system at a younger age than those placed  from the general population. The median age of children  placed in foster care because of parental drug abuse is 4.7  years, as compared to 7.5 years for other children (Walker,  Zangrillo, &amp; Smith 1991).</p>
<p>Children from homes in which substance abuse occurs may  be at higher risk for multiple foster-care placements. These  children often exhibit difficult and frustrating behaviors,  requiring greater skills and caretaking on the part of  foster parents. Long-term, single placements are uncommon  for most children in foster care. However, children who have  the constellation of behavioral problems frequently  associated with families in which substance abuse occurs  seem to be harder to place and at higher risk for multiple  placements. Pamela Osnes, director of the Carousel Preschool  Program in Tampa, Florida, described a child, two and a half  years old, who had already been in 15 placements at the time  of entry into an early intervention program. While this  specific case may be extreme, another practitioner, Carol  Cole, reported that children in the PED Program in Los  Angeles average five or six foster care placements before  they are school age.</p>
<p>Consequently, infants from families in which alcohol or  other drugs are abused can represent a special challenge to  the foster-care system. According to a recent report by the  National Black Child Development Institute (Walker,  Zangrillo, &amp; Smith 1991), our nation's child welfare  system is inadequate and is not effectively "coping  with the problems and magnitude of maternal drug-related  cases coming into the system. This is illustrated by low  discharge rates, low rates of reunification with biological  parents, low rates of adoption, infrequent parent-child and  parent-caseworker visiting, and inadequate services  essential for reunification." It is interesting to  note, however, that one study comparing adoption outcomes  found that parents adopting drug-exposed children were just  as satisfied with their children as were parents adopting  children who had not been exposed in utero (Barth 1991b).  This suggests that parent characteristics may have a greater  effect upon parent-child relations and child behavior than  drug exposure.</p>
<p>The need for family services is especially important  when one considers that a fairly high proportion of children  are returned to foster-care placements after reunification  with their biological parent(s); 32 percent of children  previously placed in foster care reenter the social services  system, as compared to only 2 percent of children who are  adopted (Stein 1987). Research has shown that reunification  is twice as likely for parents who do not use drugs as  compared to parents who do (Walker, Zangrillo, &amp; Smith  1991). The probability of reunification also decreases over  time (Goerge 1990; Fanshel &amp; Shinn 1978). "On  discharge indicators [discharge from the foster-care  system], it was the children of drug-abusing parents who  fared worse. These cases showed (1) fewer discharges  overall; (2) much less frequent reunification with the  biological parent; (3) more adoptions, but so few as to be  insignificant; and (4) in New York, earlier returns to care  after discharge . . . half returned within four months"  (Walker, Zangrillo, &amp; Smith 1991).  </p>
<p>Overall, children from families in which alcohol and  other drugs are abused are at especially high risk for  placement in an alternate care setting (Kelley 1992; Regan,  Ehrlich, &amp; Finnegan 1987). The overwhelming proportion  of children in foster care are there because the courts have  judged them to be abused or neglected. Child abuse and  neglect also intersect with the other risk factors  described:  prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol,  premature birth, inadequate parenting skills, and foster  care. And like these other risk factors, abuse and neglect  can also play a critical role in how children develop and  behave.</p>
<h2>CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</h2>
<p>Between 1984 and 1989, there was a 3,000 percent  increase in the number of drug-related abuse/neglect  petitions in the U.S. juvenile courts. Today, 22 states  report that chemical dependency is now a dominant factor in  child protective custody cases (Longino 1991).</p>
<p>For society as a whole, reports of child abuse and  neglect have been rising at an alarming rate for the past  five years. In 1989, there were 2.4 million reports of child  abuse and neglect throughout the United States (National  Committee on the Prevention of Child Abuse 1990). This  represents a 30 percent increase over reports made in 1986  (USDHHS 1988). According to the Study of National Incidence  and Prevalence of Child Abuse and Neglect, an estimated 1.5  million children were maltreated in 1986. Of these, 63  percent (or about 1,003,600 children) were neglected and 43  percent (or about 675,000 children) were abused (USDHHS  1988). Below, the variety of risk factors that contribute to  the maltreatment of children is explored. This is followed  by a section summarizing the results of prospective,  longitudinal research that has examined the learning and  behavioral consequences of abuse and neglect on young  children.  </p>
<h2>Family and Maternal Risk Factors</h2>
<p>Researchers' understanding of child maltreatment has  moved away from a belief in a single cause toward a  conceptual framework that takes into account the ongoing  interaction between the individual characteristics of  parents and children, the psychosocial environment of the  family, and the stresses or support for families within the  broader community and society-at-large (Bronfenbrenner 1979;  Belsky 1980; Cicchetti &amp; Rizley 1981). The previous  section examined some of the powerful stresses that exist in  at-risk urban communities and their contributions to  psychosocial and later learning problems experienced by  children who live in them. Below, additional risk factors  for families, mothers, and children that can increase the  danger of child abuse and/or neglect are explored. </p>
<p>Publicity concerning the tragic death of Lisa Steinberg  in New York in 1987 and the trial of her father, an  attorney, have helped to dispel some of the myths held about  child abuse. This case and others like it illustrate that  abuse does not occur only in families that live in poverty.  While anyone is potentially a child abuser, the dynamics of  poverty place an enormous strain on families, so that even  the healthiest of individuals may be affected. As Zigler and  Hall (1989) state, "No longer do we believe that being  poor `causes' child abuse. Rather, the scant educational,  economic, and social network resources that so often  accompany being poor in America are the variables that  contribute to an increased likelihood of abuse."  The  impact of poverty on a family's ability to cope is  illustrated by statistics from the National Center for  Children in Poverty (NCCP). NCCP reports that abuse is seven  times greater in families with incomes below $15,000 than in  those with higher incomes (Levine 1990).</p>
<p>Unemployment has long been associated with child abuse  and spouse abuse (Galdston 1965; Gelles 1973; Gil 1970;  Light 1973; Steinmetz &amp; Straus 1974; Gabarino &amp;  Crouter 1978). In addition to the material deprivation that  unemployment can cause, some have postulated that it also  contributes to feelings of low self-esteem, frustration, and  isolation. Bugental, Mantyla, and Lewis (1989) suggest that  these effects on the family can be significantly amplified  by a lack of social supports.  </p>
<p>Moreover, families in which child abuse occurs often  have violent or conflict-ridden relationships (Burgess &amp;  Conger 1978; Lahey et al. 1984; Lorber, Felton, &amp; Reid  1984; Straus 1980). As discussed earlier in this section,  parents who abuse alcohol and other drugs are more apt than  others to witness and be involved in violent acts within and  outside of the home. Children in homes where substances are  abused are likewise at higher risk for witnessing or  experiencing violence (Bandura 1973).</p>
<p>The psychosocial functioning of the parent can affect  that parent's ability to provide a nurturing and safe  environment for children. Mental illness, such as chronic  depression, can make it difficult for parents to sustain  meaningful interaction with their children. Depressed  parents may be emotionally distant and unavailable to their  children and unsuccessful in controlling their children's  behavior (Orroschel, Weissman, &amp; Kidd 1980; Weissman &amp;  Paykel 1974; Regan, Ehrlich, &amp; Finnegan 1987). Such  parental attributes are correlated with an elevated risk of  child neglect or abuse.</p>
<p>A number of factors render a child at an elevated risk  for abuse, especially when parents are subject to other  stresses and lack social support. Preterm babies can be  difficult to comfort, have a high-pitched cry, and appear  unresponsive to parents (Egeland &amp; Brunnquell 1979;  Frodi et al. 1978; Parke &amp; Collmer 1975; Vietze,  O'Connor, &amp; Altmeier 1982). Parents often must learn to  modify the stimulation they provide to help the infants make  gains (Field 1983; Als et al. 1986). </p>
<p>Children with disabilities (cognitive and physical) and  those with behaviors that are difficult to manage have also  been considered to be at elevated risk for child abuse (Terr  1970; Kempe 1971; Morse, Sahler, &amp; Friedman 1970;  Baldwin &amp; Oliver 1975; Johnson &amp; Morse 1968;  Herrenkohl &amp; Herrenkohl 1979, 1981; Herrenkohl,  Herrenkohl, &amp; Egolf 1983).</p>
<p>While there is no question that some children are more  difficult to raise than others, reviews of the literature  call into question the direct relationship between specific  child characteristics and maltreatment (Starr et al. 1984;  Brachfield, Goldberg, &amp; Sloman 1980; Sameroff &amp;  Chandler 1975). "These reviews and observational  studies are in agreement in noting the power of parental  responsiveness and the caretaking milieu in overcoming early  developmental difficulties as well as the inability to  predict that these children will be maltreated simply on the  basis of their own characteristics or behavior"  (Pianta, Egeland, &amp; Erickson 1989).</p>
<h2>Developmental Consequences of Child Maltreatment</h2>
<p>Research has clearly documented that the harmful  consequences of child maltreatment persist through early  childhood into adolescence and adulthood (Erickson, Egeland,  &amp; Pianta 1989; Bruner, Cole, &amp; Lloyd). In recent  years, investigators have adopted both clearer definitions  of abuses and, with a developmental perspective, have begun  to examine the specific developmental and learning sequelae  of child maltreatment.</p>
<p>Clinical observations and prospective studies shed the  most light on the variability of children's responses to  maltreatment. Among these is the Minnesota Mother-Child  Interaction Project. Instituted at the University of  Minnesota in 1975, the project was specifically designed to  develop an integrative model for examining the antecedents  of child maltreatment (Pianta, Egeland, &amp; Erickson  1989). Minnesota researchers have conducted longitudinal,  prospective studies that have begun to isolate the varied  effects of different types of maltreatment over the course  of a child's development from infancy to early school years.  Their findings are highlighted below.</p>
<h2>Physically Abused Children</h2>
<p>Pianta, Egeland, and Erickson's (1989) longitudinal  study indicated no significant differences between children  who were physically abused and non-abused children until the  age of 18 months. At this time infants who were abused began  to display signs of insecure attachment that were higher  than normal. By two years of age, abused children were angry  and frustrated and could be described as noncompliant. Their  overall scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development  were lower than those of their non-maltreated peers. Over  the preschool years, researchers noted increasing negative  affect among the abused children, finding also that these  children lacked control and exhibited little creativity in  problem solving. </p>
<p>By kindergarten, they scored lower on the Wechsler  Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI)  (vocabulary, comprehension, and block design) and were more  impulsive, creating classroom disturbances. Their teachers  described them as extremely inattentive, unpopular, and  aggressive. It is interesting to note that the Minnesota  longitudinal study found many of the same results for  children who experienced hostile verbal abuse as for those  who were physically abused.</p>
<p>Crittenden (1989) hypothesizes that abusive parents have  high achievement expectations for their children and tend to  view relationships in terms of control and coercion.  Children can react differently to high and often unrealistic  parental demands, with the abuse resulting from "non-compliance."  Some children anticipate parental demands and become high  achievers to avoid abuse. Others become defiant, taking no  responsibility for their own or their parents' behavior.  Children who become the focus of concern are usually those  who respond by being non-compliant and hypervigilant about  their relationships with other adults such as preschool and  primary school teachers.</p>
<h2>Sexually Abused Children</h2>
<p>Sexual abusewhether one incident or repeated  incidents over timerequires children to make social,  psychological, and cognitive adjustments in order to  survive. How these adjustments are made has a lasting effect  on development (Hartman &amp; Burgess 1989). Sexually abused  children may manifest symptoms of the abuse in several  different ways. Physical responses to sexual abuse in  children may include headaches, stomachaches, changes in  appetite, and urinary tract infections. Psychologically,  sexually abused children may be unable to concentrate and  appear preoccupied, depressed, and less involved or less  interested in activities. They may also be anxious around  strangers and more anxious or angry in general.  Behaviorally, children may respond to sexual abuse by acting  out sexually, becoming clingy or withdrawn, or being  hyperactive. The emergence of phobias or fears may be  especially notable (Tufts-New England Medical Center 1984).  </p>
<p>Sexual abuse also has implications for children's  behavior in the classroom. Research has indicated that  sexually abused children often have a poorer comprehension  of daily school tasks, cause more classroom disturbances,  and are generally less involved in classroom activities.  Sexually abused children are also more likely to make  irrelevant responses in class, be less attentive, and appear  more nervous and anxious. </p>
<p>Teachers have rated these children as having a strong  need for approval, engaging in more help-seeking behaviors,  and having poor overall social-emotional adjustment.  Teachers have also described sexually abused children as  impulsive and dependent, with behavior ranging from  withdrawn to aggressive. In general, they are not well-liked  by their peers (Erickson, Egeland, &amp; Pianta 1989).  </p>
<h2>Neglected Children</h2>
<p>Children who were neglected generally proceeded down a  somewhat different path. By the age of nine months, they  received significantly lower scores on the Bayley Scales of  Infant Development and by one year of age, they showed signs  of being anxiously attached to their mothers. At two these  neglected children had poor coping strategies, lacked  enthusiasm, were frustrated when presented with  problem-solving tasks, and displayed anger and resistance.  At three and one-half years of age, these children were  characterized by researchers as having very poor impulse  control and being inflexible in their approach to solving  problems. When presented with a task, neglected children  were very distractable and withdrew. Perhaps most striking  is the report by observers that more than all other groups  of maltreated children, neglected children appeared the "most  unhappy."  In preschool settings, neglected children  between the ages of four and one-half and five were highly  dependent on teachers and exhibited adjustment problems.  </p>
<p>In kindergarten, they had difficulty understanding the  day-to-day demands placed on them, and they had poor work  habits. Teachers characterized them as anxious, withdrawn,  unpopular, and inattentive. On the WPPSI, neglected children  scored much lower on vocabulary and comprehension, and  within the daily routine they had difficulty in acquiring  reading skills. </p>
<p>Crittenden (1989) hypothesizes that the early lack of  exposure to stimulus and response in the caretaking  environment leads to a basic lack of understanding of cause  and effect. Once neglected children can move about on their  own, they are overactive in their exploration of the world.  However, without adult supervision or facilitation, their  explorations are disorganized, uncontrolled, and often  dangerous. Later, as they enter school, neglected children  can appear reckless, inattentive, and lacking in social  competence. A disturbing characteristic ascribed to  neglected children is that they treat others as objects"pushing  them out of the way as if they are chairs or grabbing toys  from them as if they are shelves" (Crittenden 1989).</p>
<p>Erickson et al. (1989) report a teacher's description of  a six-year-old victim of maltreatment:</p>
<p>Her school performance is extremely erratic. One day she  does fine and the next day she can't seem to do anything.  Then she usually becomes frustrated and ends up tearing up  the work she did the day before. Her behavior is an enormous  problem for everyone in the school. One minute she is sweet  and loving, holding my hand, and the next minute she is  screaming and throwing things. I have never seen such anger!   She's a bomb ready to explode!</p>
<p>This behavioral description is a particularly striking  example of the similarities between the behavior often  ascribed to children who have been prenatally exposed to  drugs and the behavioral characteristics of maltreated  children.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>There are many environmental risks that pose threats to  healthy child development. These risks can act in  combination with one another, as well as in combination with  the perinatal risks described in the first chapter of this  monograph, to produce a number of developmental deficits and  other behavioral and cognitive problems that can threaten a  child's development and educational success, as well as pose  challenges to parents, other caregivers, and educators.  Children with such attributes have begun appearing at  increased rates in our nation's schools and preschools. At  the same time, a number of programs designed specifically  for drug-exposed children are making great strides in  acknowledging the multiplicity of risk factors that come  into play in the lives of these children. In addition, such  programs seek to find strategies to improve the  developmental and educational outcomes for at-risk children.  These programs and the children they serve are the subject  of the next chapter.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 3: </h2>
<h2>IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION IN PRESCHOOL AND PRIMARY  GRADES</h2>
<p>The previous chapters of this monograph explored the  biological and environmental risks that affect the lives of  many children in the United States. The risks begin with the  poor health and nutritional status of the mothers. If a  mother has poor nutrition, consumes illicit drugs or  tobacco, and/or receives inadequate or no prenatal care, her  baby is far more likely to be born prematurely, be small for  gestational age, and have perinatal complications. While  these conditions can pose significant danger to the infant,  targeted interventions during early childhood can help avoid  adverse outcomes. </p>
<p>Maternal use of alcohol, on the other hand, can lead to  permanent and lifelong problems including mental  retardation, physical abnormalities, and visual and auditory  impairments (Autti-Ramo &amp; Granstrom 1991; USDHHS 1990;  Jessup &amp; Green 1987; Streissguth, Clarren, &amp; Jones  1985; Rosett &amp; Weiner 1984; Iosub et al. 1981;  Streissguth et al. 1978; Hanson, Jones, &amp; Smith 1976).  </p>
<p>While the physiological effects of prenatal exposure to  alcohol appear to differ from those of prenatal exposure to  illicit drugs, children growing up in families that abuse  alcohol or other drugs are often exposed to a number of  environmental risks. By the time children enter preschool,  the caregiving environment has had ample opportunity to  affect their development. For some, the environment poses  many hazards, including inadequate caregiving; multiple,  short-term foster-care placements; and abuse and neglect. As  described in the previous chapter, the consequences of such  environmental stress on child development can be  devastating.</p>
<p>Both the consequences of maternal substance abuse and  the effects of the environment on children's development and  learning must be understood in order to marshall effective  resources for prevention and intervention. As Costella Tate,  social worker for Project D.A.I.S.Y., in Washington D.C.  comments, "Some of the identified children (prenatally  exposed to drugs) had significant problems at birth due to a  lack of oxygen, a byproduct of drug abuse. However, by age  three, most of these children are not exhibiting serious  problems. This is especially true if the mom and baby had  access to formal or informal support systems."  </p>
<p>Given the many and varied influences on children who are  prenatally exposed to drugs, it is no wonder that such  children exhibit a range of characteristics. The patterns of  maternal drug abuse, a family's stability, the caretaking  skills of the parents, access to quality health care and  education, and the availability of social support all vary  enormously. So then do the developmental profiles of  children.</p>
<h2>DIVERSE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN</h2>
<p>The fact that there is no typical profile of  drug-exposed children is unanimously confirmed by leading  practitioners. Their collective experiences underscore the  individual needs and strengths of the children they serve.</p>
<p>In an effort to obtain firsthand accounts of specific  behaviors exhibited by children prenatally exposed to drugs,  our investigators included interviews with program  administrators and practitioners from:</p>
<ul><li>PED (Children Prenatally Exposed to Drugs) Program in  Los Angeles, California  </li>
<li>Operation PAR (Parental Awareness and Responsibility)  in Largo, Florida  </li>
<li>Project D.A.I.S.Y. (Developing Appropriate Intervention  Strategies for the Young Child) in Washington, D.C.  </li>
<li>Carousel Preschool Program in Tampa, Florida  </li>
<li>Parent-Child Intervention Program in East Palo Alto,  California  </li>
<li>Hillsborough County Training Program in Tampa, Florida  </li>
</ul><p>They confirmed that the infants and young children in  their programs display a range and variety of behaviors.  Their clinical impressions are based on observations. While  these reports are of children who have been (or are  suspected of being) prenatally exposed to drugs, these  experts stressed that the behavioral characteristics they  observe are <i>not necessarily </i>the consequence of  prenatal drug exposure. As Vicky Ferrara, a teacher in the  PED Program, states, "once we have examined the  histories of children, it is difficult to look at their  behavior as specifically due to prenatal drug exposure."  </p>
<p>Because practitioners do not see a specific  constellation of behaviors and learning problems associated  with drug-exposed children, they were asked to identify  behavioral or developmental problems that most concern  teachers working with an at-risk population. While their  responses varied, three themes emerged.  </p>
<h2>Disorganization</h2>
<p>Some children appear to have no framework by which to  organize themselves or their environment. This  disorganization is manifested in many ways. Some children  move from object to object and place to place having great  difficulty in completing age-appropriate tasks. While this  affects their ability to manipulate materials and learn in  solitary play, it can also affect their ability to  participate in group activities. For example, a child  participating with the teacher in a small group activity may  be easily distracted by other materials or drawings on the  wall. Once distracted by other items in the room, the  child's attention is lost. This short attention span,  coupled with a high level of activity, can create classroom  disruptions that make it difficult for other children to  play and learn.  As a result, other children who are also  disorganized are easily distracted and, once interrupted,  have difficulty returning to the activity at hand.</p>
<p>Difficulty coping with change or transitions in the  environment is viewed by some as another manifestation of  the disorganization that some children experience. Children  can be very fearful when encountering a new situation.  Costella Tate from Project D.A.I.S.Y. illustrated this point  by recounting a recent class field trip. Even with  preparation, children became afraid of the subway and what  might happen to them in this situation. What might have been  an enjoyable excursion for many children became a  frightening experience for these children at risk.  </p>
<p>Changes in the staff of a preschool program present  another type of transition. Some children will be very upset  and cry if they come into the room and see that they have a  substitute teacher for the day. The predictability of the  daily schedule and the consistency of staff in the program  are critical strategies that limit changes and help children  organize their environment. Children who have difficulty  coping with change need multiple cues to facilitate their  moving from one activity to another.  </p>
<p>Practitioners offer a variety of explanations for the  levels of disorganization that they observe in some  children. Some practitioners attribute the disorganization  to a lack of early stimulation at home. Children who attend  their programs have little or no exposure to the kinds of  materials and equipment available in a typical preschool.  Others emphasize the lack of adult-child interaction that  helps children explore their environment systematically and  develop a basic understanding of cause and effect. Some  suspect that the disorganization they observe in some  children is a consequence of neurological damage resulting  from prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs.  </p>
<h2>Language Delays</h2>
<p>Practitioners also report a range of language and speech  delays, including language- processing problems, poor  articulation, limited vocabulary, and limited expressive  language skills. Some children do not understand simple  questions such as, "Are you hungry?"  Even at five  years old, they are unable to follow two-steps commands.   Another characteristic of children's language-processing  problems is their inability to understand the real meaning  of words and to generalize these "symbols of experience"  to new but similar situations. Carol Cole offers a typical  example, "If you tell a child not to go out into the  street, he or she does not understand that you mean all  streets." </p>
<p>Many practitioners identified poor articulation as a  common problem, which makes children's communication  attempts unintelligible to both teachers and peers.  Superintendent Dr. Charlie Knight reported that children  from the Parent-Child Intervention Program (PCIP) in East  Palo Alto could not enunciate the word "potty"  well enough to make themselves understood, and as a result  had frequent toileting accidents.  </p>
<p>Children's lack of vocabulary and limited abilities to  express themselves are also related to some of the  aggressive and disruptive behaviors reported. Children with  limited language find themselves unable to engage in  imaginative play. Taking on a role and acting it out are  crucial to developing more advanced forms of play. Moreover,  the frustration that children can feel when they are unable  to make their needs known can lead to a variety of  aggressive acts. Anyone who has taught in a preschool knows  the importance of a child's being able to say "I was  playing with that!" When the child cannot, grabbing is  usually the next best strategy. Costella Tate from Project  D.A.I.S.Y. provides the following vignette:</p>
<p>One little girl in the program was very distant with the  teachers in the classroom. She was aggressive with other  children and would strike out and hit them. As we worked  with her, especially on her expressive language skills, her  behavior started to improve. She was finally able to express  her needs and feelings. It is hard to know exactly why she  had no communication skills. Perhaps it was related to her  exposure to drugs prenatally. Maybe it was the physical  abuse she experienced as a baby.       </p>
<p>Program staff repeatedly mentioned their concern about  the caregiving environment as a factor contributing to  children's language problems. "The lack of positive  verbal interactions between parents and children along with  the amount of TV that many children watch at home, all can  affect a child's ability to communicate," said Linda  Delapenha, diagnostic supervisor in the Hillsborough County  Public Schools.</p>
<h2>Insecure Attachments</h2>
<p>Practitioners frequently refer to children's history of  poor attachment to their caregivers. The PED Program reports  that many children have five or six foster care or  out-of-home placements by the age of three. Even if there  are fewer placements, frequently they are unstable. In  describing the foster-care system in California, Carol Cole  explained that homes are often licensed for certain age  groups only, so that as children mature, their foster  placement changes. She states that "many children move  for this reason. Others are waiting for decisions about  reunification with their biological families. This lack of  stability and security does not promote attachment and may  affect children cognitively as well as emotionally."   </p>
<p>It is not surprising, then, that some children have  difficulty forming relationships with adults. Practitioners  report that these children are indiscriminate in their  attachments and will be too friendly or overly affectionate.  Others rarely seek the assistance, comfort, and support of  an adult.</p>
<p>It is well documented by researchers that early bonding  and attachment can influence the development of future  relationships. Many theorize that early bonding experiences  provide children with a template that they continue to apply  to their interactions, not only with adults but also with  their peers. Depending on their early experiences, children  may cling to adults, and be reluctant to venture out on  their own and explore. When children's confidence and trust  are compromised, they have difficulty making decisions and  moving toward independencea critical task in the  preschool years.   </p>
<p>Disorganization, speech and language problems, and the  effects of poor attachment are some of the behaviors that  most trouble professionals working with children who have  been prenatally exposed to drugs and are exposed to other  environmental risks.   </p>
<p>These problems can impede learning, social development,  and mastery over oneself and the environment.  </p>
<p>Practitioners are just now beginning to follow into  kindergarten and into the primary grades the cohort of  children who were prenatally exposed to drugs and other  risks.  However, it is clear that if such problems persist,  children will be at high risk for school failure.</p>
<p>As Courtney Cazden states, "language is both the  curriculum content and the learning environment, both the  object of knowledge and the medium through which knowledge  is acquired." From first through third grade children  are learning to write and to read, to encode symbols and  decode symbols. They are asked to work increasingly on their  own, remember and follow instructions, and relate concepts  to one another. At this age children become intensely  interested in their peers and through their positive social  interaction develop social competence. </p>
<p>Early intervention provided through such specialized  programs as those described below and comprehensive child  development programs such as Head Start will assist many  children at risk to develop the skills needed to succeed in  school.</p>
<h2>THE PROMISE OF SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>While researchers have been studying prenatal drug  exposure, administrators and teachers have begun to develop  programs to effectively address the troubling behaviors  exhibited by children from environments in which substances  are abused. Six nationally recognized programs are described  below. They illustrate the range of characteristics  exhibited by children at risk and detail the key features  that make these programs successful. </p>
<h2>PED Program</h2>
<p>As early as 1984, the Los Angeles Unified School  District recognized the need to establish a program to serve  preschool children who were prenatally exposed to drugs.   Initially, the PED (Children Prenatally Exposed to Drugs)  Program was located in the Salvin School, one of 17 schools  serving children in the district with special needs. </p>
<p>To be eligible for the PED Program, children must be  three years of age and have an IQ within the normal range.  In addition, children enrolled must have had a medical  history of prenatal drug exposure and display one or more of  the following behavioral characteristics: tremors,  perceptual disorganization, blanking out, speech and  language disorders, minimal developmental delays,  disorganized play, difficulty with transitions, poor peer  relationships, and poor coping skills (Los Angeles Unified  School District 1989). </p>
<p>Early in its history, the sponsors of the PED Program  recognized that children prenatally exposed to drugs do not  need to be placed in a separate classroom. Maintaining  children in separate classrooms allowed PED practitioners to  learn more about such children's specific needs and to  design appropriate interventions. Over the years, PED  Program staff have systematically documented the behavioral  characteristics of children enrolled and specific strategies  that they found effective. Published as a practical guide,  <i>Today's Challenge: Teaching Strategies for Working with  Young Children Pre-Natally Exposed to Drugs/Alcohol</i> is  now used by many other programs across the country (Los  Angeles Unified School District 1989).</p>
<p>The PED Program articulates a clear philosophy based on  children's needs for consistent and nurturing relationships.  Therefore, an accepting and respectful emotional climate is  at the heart of the PED Program's approach to intervention.  The context suggested by PED practitioners is one where "children  know what's expected of them and know what to expect,"  explains Carol Cole, a former PED program teacher. The  quality of teachers' interactions with children, predictable  routines and rituals, careful observations and assessments,  transition planning, and a high teacher-to-child ratio are  all "protective factors" that PED staff  incorporate into their design of preschool classrooms. </p>
<p>PED's guidebook organizes teaching strategies into six  major areas:  learning, play, social/emotional,  communication, motor development, and home/school  partnership. Suggested strategies embody developmentally  appropriate practice and reflect the understanding that  young children must be actively engaged in the learning  process. </p>
<p>PED's pioneering work has significantly influenced the  field through its clearly articulated approach to working  with children prenatally exposed to drugs and environmental  risks. The Los Angeles Unified School District, Division of  Special Education has recently launched the Infant/Preschool  Program, a model demonstration project to test strategies  outlined by the PED Team in the district's publicly funded  child-care centers. This important project, begun in 1991,  will provide critical information on how successful and  adaptable the PED Program model is when applied to  integrated settings.</p>
<h2>Operation PAR</h2>
<p>As a therapeutic community in Florida, Operation PAR  (Parental Awareness and Responsibility) has provided a  comprehensive range of services since 1970. Because of its  focus on recovering adults, PAR represents a different  approach from PED and other school-based programs. In April  1990, a collaborative research and demonstration project  between Operation PAR and the University of Southern Florida  Psychiatry Department expanded PAR's treatment program for  women. PAR Village is a residential therapeutic community  where mothers, living with their children, participate in  drug treatment. PAR Village is designed to address the  common problem that chemically dependent mothers facethe  lack of adequate child care that often forces mother to  forgo or interrupt their treatment. </p>
<p>Mothers who enter this residential family program must  be 18 or older and have a serious drug abuse or dependency  problem. They must have a child under 12 months of age; they  may also bring a second child age 10 or younger. </p>
<p>A key feature of PAR Village is a child-care program for  drug-exposed infants and children of chemically dependent  parents. Children enrolled in the center receive  comprehensive evaluations that form the basis of individual  education plans. The educational approach is based on the  High Scope Curriculum and the curriculum addresses the  social, emotional, motor, language, and cognitive  development of the children enrolled. In addition to typical  child care activities, mothers routinely visit their  children at child care to enhance the bonding between parent  and child. </p>
<p>PAR Village offers a unique combination of services that  addresses the multiple needs of chemically dependent mothers  and their children. The program evaluation currently  underway will yield important data on whether child care  services linked to treatment produce better treatment  outcomes for parents in the long term.  </p>
<h2>Project D.A.I.S.Y</h2>
<p>Project D.A.I.S.Y. (Developing Appropriate Intervention  Strategies for the Young Child) is one of the initiatives of  the Early Childhood Program Branch in the District of  Columbia Public Schools. This program is a developmentally  appropriate, regular education program that includes in its  population children who have been prenatally exposed to  drugs.</p>
<p>Project D.A.I.S.Y. currently serves 60 children. Each  classroom is comprised of fifteen children in each of the  four classroom sites. Of the fifteen children in each  classroom, five children are documented from the D.C.  General Hospital Birth to Three tracking system as  prenatally substance exposed. The other ten children in the  classroom are students for whom no risk factors have been  identified. The classrooms are multi-aged settings that  fully integrate drug-exposed children with their non-exposed  peers in regular education early childhood classrooms.</p>
<p>Project D.A.I.S.Y. is supported by a multidisciplinary  consultation team comprised of two clinical social workers,  three speech and language pathologists, two clinical  psychologists, and a nutritionist. Additionally, the program  offers parent groups and home-based intervention support to  all of the children in the D.A.I.S.Y. classrooms and their  families. </p>
<p>The emphasis of Project D.A.I.S.Y. is in the development  of strategies that can be generalized to diverse populations  of children that exhibit similar concerns. Some key concepts  of this project include:</p>
<ul><li>Caring communities in which children share a common  sense of belonging must be developed.   </li>
<li>Consistent routines and rituals that provide  predictability in the environment must be established.  </li>
<li>Environments must reflect the range of developmental  needs of students.  </li>
<li>Teachers must use and model a common language to create  a common set of experiences and understanding for children.  </li>
<li>The curriculum must reflect the diversity of children.  </li>
<li>Parents must be viewed as partners in the educational  process.  </li>
</ul><p>The dissemination of the effective strategies used in  Project D.A.I.S.Y. is currently taking place in 60 schools  within the District of Columbia.</p>
<p><b>Carousel Preschool Program</b> </p>
<p>The Carousel Preschool Program is based at the Florida  Mental Health Institute at the University of South Florida.  Children are referred from the pediatric department within  the College of Medicine at the University and are also  self-referred from the community.  </p>
<p>Prior to enrollment, children attend a full-day  screening. They are observed by staff who use specific  protocols for data collection. Standardized intelligence  tests are also administered. Children attend the program  five days per week, six hours per day. The program is in  session for 11 months of the year. Two teachers with special  education backgrounds and a part-time supervisor who has a  mental health background are assigned to each classroom. In  addition, each child is assigned a case manager who works  with the entire family, referring the family to support  services and evaluating the entire family's progress.  </p>
<p>Carousel is funded by the Office of Special Education  Programs in the U.S. Department of Education to develop a  model for working with prenatally exposed children age two  and one-half to school age. The program has been operating  for six years. Currently they are serving sixteen childreneight  typically developing children who have no known history of  prenatal drug exposure and eight who have had positive  toxicity screens at birth.   </p>
<h2>Parent-Child Intervention Program</h2>
<p>Six years ago the Ravenswood City School District in  East Palo Alto, California, began to search actively for  support to develop programs for children prenatally exposed  to drugs. The impetus came from the superintendent, Dr.  Charlie Knight, who began getting calls from teachers  expressing concerns about the difficult and different  behaviors they were observing in the incoming kindergarten  classes. Teachers noticed that many children took far longer  to acclimate to the rules and routines of school. Unlike  past groups of kindergartners, many of these five and six  year olds would have frequent toileting accidents. The most  disturbing problems identified were episodes of explosive  and unprovoked violence. </p>
<p>Recognizing that drugs played an increasingly  destructive role in the community, the district applied for  and received funding from the Office of Substance Abuse  Prevention (OSAP, HHS) to launch a Parent-Child Intervention  Program (PCIP). Working with hospitals, clinics, and child  protective service agencies, since 1989 the PCIP has  provided child care for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers  prenatally exposed to drugs. Now serving 49 children from 20  families, PCIP offers both parent/caregiver education and  support services. Through early intervention, the Ravenswood  City Schools District is attempting to prevent the troubling  behaviors that its teachers have observed in recent  kindergarten classes.</p>
<p>Key ingredients for successful programming based on  PCIP's experience include the following (Knight 1991):</p>
<ul><li>Support early development by providing services at or  near birth.  </li>
<li>Provide child care that enables mothers and other  caregivers to get respite care as well as treatment and  other support services.  </li>
<li>Locate all the relevant community resources.  </li>
<li>Offer long-term services that acknowledge the range of  supports that parents need to move away from drugs, acquire  education, and settle in to employment.   </li>
<li>Require mothers to attend parenting counseling several  times per week.  </li>
<li>Coordinate with critical county agencies such as child  protective services,  health clinics, treatment programs,  and housing.  </li>
<li>Provide thorough and ongoing training for staff to  equip them to respond to the diverse strengths and needs of  the children and families they serve.  </li>
</ul><h2>Hillsborough County Training Program</h2>
<p>Hillsborough County Public Schools in Tampa, Florida, is  the twelfth-largest district in the U.S., serving urban,  rural, and suburban communities. Three years ago, the  district organized a countywide task force called the Drug  Exposed Children's Committee (DECC) to plan and coordinate  services for drug-exposed children. </p>
<p>Comprised of school administrators, specialists,  teachers, Head Start staff, and other community leaders,  this committee began its work by conducting a study to  identify four to six year olds prenatally exposed to drugs.  Using a teacher-developed checklist of behaviors commonly  attributed to drug-exposed preschoolers, researchers rated  the behaviors of 85 children enrolled in programs serving a  high-risk population. In addition, experienced clinical  staff conducted interviews with children's parents to  determine whether or not these children had been prenatally  exposed to alcohol or other drugs. While the findings remain  unpublished, DECC Chairperson Linda Delapenha reports that "there  was no correlation between at-risk behaviors and parents'  self-reports of substance abuse. Children with developmental  and behavioral problems had complex histories including  child abuse, parental death, prescription drug use by  pregnant mothers, and other environmental or health problems  sufficient to cause them to be at risk for school failure"  (Delapenha n.d., unpublished). </p>
<p>Study results have formed the basis of the current  philosophy of DECC and related school services. Linda  Delapenha notes:</p>
<p>One child in the study sample seemed to exhibit all the "classic  signs" of a child who has been prenatally exposed to  drugs:  distractible, disorganized play, and somewhat  violent and aggressive behavior. I was convinced that, of  all the children studied, this child had definitely been  exposed to drugs. The caregiver interview revealed something  different. The child was being sexually abused. This was a  good lesson for all of us (Delapenha 1991, personal  communication).   </p>
<p>Recent efforts of the DECC and the school district have  primarily focused on providing an inservice training program  for the district's preschool and primary school teachers to  enhance their skills in working with at-risk children.  Designed for teachers in mainstream settings, the training  program is based on an early childhood education model  rather than an instructional approach. It assumes that  classrooms are equipped with interest centers, and children  are actively engaged with a range of materials. </p>
<p>The training program is organized into six three-hour  evening sessions and is designed to be highly interactive  and practical. Early on, teachers are involved in  make-and-take activities, which give them concrete ideas to  integrate into their programs. Teacher recertification  credits are offered to all those attending the training  programs, providing an additional incentive for teachers to  attend. Participating teachers come from a variety of  school- and community-based settings, including state-funded  preschool, preschool special education, Head Start, day  care, and primary grades. The success of the training  program has been recognized by the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation, which has awarded the Hillsborough County Public  Schools with a two-year grant to develop its training  program and disseminate it nationally.</p>
<p>These six programs are examples of ways in which the  education and treatment communities are designing services  to meet the needs of families and children living in  situations in which alcohol and other drugs are abused. The  list of communities adapting these approaches continues to  grow. In some cases, this takes the form of direct services  to preschoolers; in others, the services are focused on  enhancing the skills of classroom staff in mainstream  settings, such as preschools and primary grade classrooms.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Even though practitioners often find it difficult to  define clearly the etiology of the problem behaviors they  confront in the classroom, they have identified a number of  strategies to improve both the classroom environment and  educational outcomes. Some of these strategies are grounded  in sound early childhood education practices, while others  are adapted from strategies used in special education.  Practitioners have found that children need:</p>
<ul><li>environments that are flexible and allow visual stimuli  to be regulated according to their abilities to manage these  stimuli  </li>
<li>consistent and nurturing staff who form close bonds  with the children in their care  </li>
<li>predictable routines so that they are able to  anticipate and manage change  </li>
<li>transition procedures that allow them to ease slowly  from one activity to another  </li>
</ul><p>Other aspects of sound programming include:</p>
<ul><li>the use of a wide range of assessment techniques that  generate information regarding children's skill levels,  coping strategies, and learning styles  </li>
<li>sound individual education plans  </li>
<li>learning environments that enable teachers to meet  children's individual needs effectively  </li>
<li>strong partnerships between families and schools  </li>
<li>parent services, including parenting education, drug  treatment programs, and social services  </li>
</ul><h2>SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>Many risk factors can compromise infant prospects for  healthy development. The use of illicit drugs or alcohol by  their mothers during pregnancy is among those risks.  However, there are many other pre- and postnatal factors  that can affect infant development. Some, such as prenatal  care, can help moderate the risk of adverse outcomes  associated with drug or alcohol exposure. Others, such as  inadequate childrearing skills, can transform perinatal  vulnerabilities into psychosocial disabilities with lifelong  implications. What follows is a summary of conclusions drawn  from the research about the role that prenatal exposure to  drugs and other risk factors play in challenging the healthy  development of our children as well as some of the ways in  which this challenge can be met.</p>
<h2>EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS</h2>
<ul><li>The use of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to Fetal  Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Alcohol-Related Birth Defects  (ARBD), both of which involve permanent physical and  cognitive disabilities.  </li>
<li>Heroin, and possibly other illicit drugs, can result in  the neonatal abstinence syndrome. While the long-term  effects of this condition remain uncertain, it places  substantial stress on both the infant and parents and  requires extensive and expensive medical care.  </li>
<li>Prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs may  contribute to a risk of other adverse perinatal outcomes and  developmental delays. The extent of this contribution and  the duration of these delays remain uncertain.  </li>
<li>Prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs can  contribute to preterm and small-for-gestational-age (SGA)  birth. Other factors that elevate the risk of preterm and  SGA birth tend to concentrate in those sociodemographic  groups that also have an elevated risk of prenatal drug and  exposure.  </li>
<li>Preterm and SGA birth associated with, or independent  of, prenatal drug or exposure can have developmental  consequences. Socioeconomic factors, and especially the  extent of prenatal care, predict the extent of these  consequences far better than biologic birth status.  </li>
</ul><h2>EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS   </h2>
<ul><li>A number of postnatal risk factors can, individually or  in combination with other factors including drug or alcohol  exposure and/or preterm or SGA  birth, contribute to  behavioral and cognitive impairments.  </li>
<li>A substantial number of children who have been  prenatally exposed to drugs grow up in environments  characterized by postnatal risk factors, including poverty,  exposure to violence, inadequate caregiving, parents who  abuse alcohol and other drugs, child abuse and neglect, and  multiple foster care placements.  </li>
<li>The effects of exposure to and anxiety caused by  witnessing violence in the home and community can also  affect children's emotional life and development.  </li>
<li>Risk factors in households in which the primary  caregivers abuse alcohol and other drugs include family  discord and violence, inadequate or inappropriate  interactions with children, lack of adult supervision, and  disorganization and instability.  </li>
<li>Child abuse or neglect can play a critical role in how  children develop and behave. Risk factors for child abuse or  neglect include a vulnerable perinatal status due to drug or  alcohol abuse; preterm or SGA birth; parents who abuse  alcohol and other drugs; and a household subject to   stresses such as poverty and a lack of social supports.   </li>
<li>Many infants and children who are prenatally exposed to  drugs have parents who abuse alcohol and other drugs, have  been abused or neglected, and/or are placed in foster homes.  Many experience multiple placements before they reach school  age. While foster care may be preferable to life in a  household in which alcohol and other drugs are abused, the  instability and disruptions caused by foster placement, and  especially multiple placements, also take a toll on a  child's emotional and cognitive development.  </li>
<li>Postnatal risk factors can, individually or in  combination, produce effects including behavioral  disorganization, language delays, difficulties with  attachment and bonding, memory and learning disorders,  inadequate social skills that result in difficulty relating  to peers and adults, post-traumatic stress disorder, and  behavioral problems ranging from withdrawal to unprovoked  violence.  </li>
</ul><h2>EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS </h2>
<p>Children entering preschool and elementary classrooms  bring with them a wide range of behaviors, dispositions, and  learning styles. Some of these pose problems, both for the  children's healthy development and educational outcomes, and  for classroom management. Many strategies for managing  classrooms with children with cognitive and developmental  challenges have been developed and used successfully  throughout the country. In addition, a number of specialized  programs are developing and refining approaches dealing with  children whose development and educational success are  threatened by prenatal drug and alcohol exposure, as well as  the other risk factors outlined in this monograph. Careful  assessment techniques, tailored educational interventions,  opportunities for individual attention, and small class size  can contribute to the healthy development of children and  mediate the effects of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive  problems, whatever their etiology.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to oversimplify a response to the "problem  of drug-exposed children."  Stereotyping these children  can mislead teachers and other caregivers as to children's  abilities and potential. Prenatal drug or alcohol exposure  may indicate that a child is at risk, but exposure cannot be  taken as a definitive sign that the child will not develop  normally. As Richard Barth (1991) wrote, "Children  exposed to drugs in utero do not represent a class of  childrenthey may be as varied as children who are not  exposed."  At the same time, many children who are not  prenatally exposed to alcohol face incredible threats to  their health and development because of child abuse and  maltreatment, parents who abuse alcohol and other drugs,  violence, and a host of social ills. Ignoring these children  simply because they are not drug exposed seriously  underestimates the damage done by these other hazards.</p>
<p>It is up to us whether at-risk children will become  members of a "lost generation." The success that  dedicated practitioners have in reaching such children  proves that growth, healthy development, and educational  achievement are real possibilities for all children. With  the proper knowledge and resources, practitioners can meet  this challenge. Parents, educators, and citizens cannot, and  should not, refuse these children the help they deserve in  surmounting the barriers to a healthy and fulfilling future.</p>

<p>APPENDIX A</p>
<h2>SOURCES OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>This appendix explains the sources of information used  in the three major sections of the monograph.</p>
<h2>EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS</h2>
<p>Five databases were searched for citations to research  reports since 1980 on the effects of prenatal exposure to  alcohol and other drugs. These databases included MEDLINE,  ERIC, ECER, PsycINFO, and Drug Information-Alcohol  Use/Abuse. Selected articles were read to inform our work,  focusing on:</p>
<ul><li>the primary research on the effects of prenatal drug  exposure and its long-term developmental outcomes   </li>
<li>the most important historical and contemporary research  on prenatal alcohol exposure, as well as several  comprehensive reviews of the literature on this subject  </li>
<li>reports, descriptions, and materials emanating from  programs whose goals include improving the developmental and  educational outcomes of children prenatally exposed to drugs  and alcohol  </li>
</ul><p>Published research was augmented with interviews with  six researchers currently engaged in studies of prenatal  drug or alcohol exposure. These studies were identified by  reviewing:</p>
<ul><li>research reports cited in the literature searches  described above  </li>
<li>grant and contract awards and other resource materials  provided by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation, the Department of Education, the  National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Administration on  Children and Families  </li>
<li>testimony at congressional hearings provided by the  project sponsors and identified through a search of the  Government Printing Office Monthly Catalog Database and  obtained from congressional committees and subcommittees  </li>
<li>the Federal Research in Progress database  </li>
</ul><p>The researchers generously shared their time and  thoughts concerning prenatal exposure to alcohol and other  drugs. None commented in detail on current unpublished  research. The standards of medical research and the  requirements of many peer-reviewed medical journals  recognize the danger of premature release of research data  or conclusions, which may be misinterpreted by the lay  community, divorced from the methodological context and the  author's full text. However, the researchers provided  citations to or copies of recent and forthcoming  publications, ensuring access to the most recent available  information. Appendix B includes a list of those  interviewed.</p>
<p>Research and information on the effects of preterm and  small-for-gestational-age births were identified as well as  prevalence and sociodemographic considerations, by:</p>
<ul><li>searching MEDLINE  </li>
<li>consulting resources on early child development  </li>
<li>reviewing the reference lists of relevant articles  identified during the primary literature search  </li>
<li>reviewing HOLLIS, the catalog of the library  collections of Harvard University  </li>
</ul><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>Much of the base material for this section was gathered  using:</p>
<ul><li>standard sources on the relevant issues  </li>
<li>targeted literature searches in MEDLINE, ERIC, ECER,  Family Resources, Child Abuse and Neglect Database, and  PsycINFO  </li>
<li>reference lists of the articles on prenatal drug and  alcohol exposure, many of which cite research relevant to  confounding and intervening variables  </li>
</ul><p>Also utilized were inhouse expertise and resources on  child development; substance abuse; child abuse and neglect;  domestic, peer, and community violence; and the effects of  poverty on family systems.</p>
<h2>IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION IN PRESCHOOL AND PRIMARY  GRADES</h2>
<p>Comprehensive studies describing the behavioral,  psychological, and demographic characteristics of the  current population of at-risk children seen in preschools  and </p>
<p>programs for drug-exposed children do not exist. A few  programs have published clientele descriptions, but these  lack methodological rigor. Thus most of our information on  these children was obtained from practitioners and  practitioner reports. Practitioners with programs for  drug-exposed children were identified by reviewing:</p>
<ul><li>program descriptions and reports identified through the  literature review  </li>
<li>testimony before congressional hearings   </li>
<li>articles in the popular press provided by the project  sponsors and identified through searches of the PAPERS, UPI,  and AP databases  </li>
<li>program descriptions and materials provided by the  project sponsors  </li>
</ul><p>Using semistructured protocols, representatives from 12  programs were interviewed. Appendix B identifies these  individuals and their programs.</p>
