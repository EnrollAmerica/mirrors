<p>Mental illness, like any health concern, can disrupt the ability to  		work. Less than 20 percent of people who receive publicly funded mental health  		services are employed, although research consistently demonstrates that, with  		the right supports, 40-60 percent of people with serious mental illness (SMI)  		can work. Many of those who do so work part-time, intermittently, or at low  		wages (Blyler 2003; Bond 2004, 2007; SAMHSA 2011). Unemployment or low levels  		of work may lead to reliance on disability benefit programs, which gives the  		social safety net an important role in their lives. Working-age people with  		psychiatric disorders are the largest and most rapidly expanding group of  		Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income  		(SSI) beneficiaries. Currently, 36 percent of SSDI and 60 percent of  		working-age SSI beneficiaries have a mental illness (SSA 2011a, 2011b), and  		estimates suggest that less than 4 percent of SSDI beneficiaries exit the  		program due to earnings within the first ten years of enrollment (Stapleton et  		al. 2010).</p>
<p>For those with access to mental health care and whose illnesses are  		responsive to treatment, disruptions to the ability to work are often  		short-term, allowing them to return to existing jobs and former productivity  		levels quickly. People who cannot afford treatment, whose treatment is not  		quickly or fully effective, or whose illness frequently recurs, however, may  		find that work disruptions due to mental illness result in long-term disability  		and unemployment. These people require a range of supports in addition to  		mental health services if they are to return to work quickly and stay at  		work.</p>
<p>A number of employment programs and services have proven effective at  		helping people with SMI and other psychiatric disorders find and keep work. In  		particular, evidence-based supported employment, especially the standardized  		Individual Placement and Support model, has been shown to be more effective  		than traditional vocational programs in helping people with SMI obtain  		competitive employment. Supported employment is a strategy for helping people  		with disabilities participate in the labor market, in a job of their choosing,  		with professional support (Bond et al. 2001). Supported employment helps  		individuals with a variety of characteristics--age, gender, diagnosis,  		education, and so on--achieve higher rates of competitive employment than those  		in control groups who have the same characteristics. Job-development services  		and integration of vocational and clinical services are vital for making  		supported employment successful.</p>
<p>Evidence-based practices also exist for helping individuals with less  		severe conditions; for example, Wang et al. (2007) demonstrated that a  		telephone-based care management program targeted to employees with significant  		depression significantly improved job retention and hours worked. In a  		systematic review, Nieuwenhuijsen et al. (2008) found that psychodynamic  		therapy in combination with tricyclic antidepressant medication reduced  		sickness absence. Dewa et al. (2003) found that early intervention was  		significantly associated with a reduced length of disability episode. Burton et  		al. (2007) found that those who met antidepressant treatment adherence criteria  		during a three-month acute-phase follow-up period were significantly less  		likely to have any short-term disability absence. In another study, Adler et  		al. (2006) concluded that, although clinical interventions improve mental  		health, additional workplace interventions may be required to improve the  		performance of depressed employees.</p>
<p>But although these services and supports are critical for preventing or  		minimizing work disruptions associated with mental illness and for facilitating  		re-entry into the workforce, not everyone has access to them. People with low  		incomes, high health care needs, or no insurance may have limited access, if  		any, particularly if they are not eligible for Medicaid or other public mental  		health programs. Access is even more limited for people meeting all three of  		these conditions, such as the nearly 2.5 million Americans with SMI who have  		incomes under 400 percent of the federal poverty level and are uninsured  		(Malone 2012). Even for those who are insured, affording mental health and  		employment-support services may be a challenge since these services are not  		covered by many health insurance plans (Beronio et al. 2013; Garfield et al.  		2010). Enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 (42 USC 2714)  		expands access to health insurance, including coverage of mental health  		services, and also has the potential to enhance existing funding options for  		employment-support services for people with mental illness. In this issue  		brief, we explore the provisions of the ACA that may enable Americans with  		mental illness to obtain the mental health treatment and support services they  		need to continue working or get back to work.</p>
<h2><a name="expanded" id="expanded">Expanded Options for Health Insurance  		Coverage</a></h2>
<p>The ACA expands access to both public and private health insurance  		coverage. The law permits states to extend Medicaid eligibility to individuals  		based solely upon income and contains a number of provisions that improve  		access to private insurance, regardless of employment status. Extending health  		insurance coverage to those who were previously ineligible or unable to  		purchase it may improve access to mental health services, including  		employment-support services, which may in turn help people with mental  		illnesses to sustain their productivity and/or return to work quickly after an  		episode of mental illness.</p>
<h3>The Expansion of Medicaid</h3>
<p>The Medicaid program is currently the primary funder of mental health  		services in the United States (Kaiser Family Foundation 2011). Before the ACA  		was enacted, Medicaid beneficiaries with mental illness generally qualified for  		the program due to disability (meaning they met the definition of disability  		established for the federal SSI program), or they had dependent children, or  		they lived in a state that offered coverage to those with extremely low incomes  		(Bazelon Center 2012). Beginning in January 2014, the ACA provides federal  		funding for states that choose to expand Medicaid eligibility to include  		individuals with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level,  		regardless of disability or parental status (Rosenbaum et al. 2011).<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note1">1</a></sup> This means that people without children and those who  		do not qualify on the basis of disability may now have access to Medicaid  		coverage. About 7 percent of those newly eligible for Medicaid are expected to  		have SMIs, and many more new Medicaid beneficiaries will have mild or moderate  		disorders (Malone 2012). The effect of this expansion for people with mental  		illnesses will vary by state, however, as the Supreme Court has ruled that each  		state can decide whether to expand its Medicaid program (Musumeci 2012).</p>
<p>In states that choose to expand Medicaid as authorized by the ACA, the  		benefits provided may be different from those offered to individuals eligible  		for the state's full Medicaid plan. Benefits for the newly eligible do have to  		cover a full range of essential health benefits defined by the ACA,<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note2">2</a></sup>  		including mental health and substance use disorder services and rehabilitative  		and habilitative services (Wishon Siegwarth &amp; Koyanagi 2012). In addition,  		federal mental health parity requirements apply to these mental health and  		substance use disorder benefits.</p>
<p>The benchmark plans and alternative benefit plans modeled after them are  		highly unlikely to cover supported employment. However, under the Social  		Security Act, some groups are exempt from mandatory enrollment in these  		"alternative benefit plans" and are entitled to a state's traditional package  		of Medicaid benefits (Bazelon Center 2012; Wishon Siegwarth &amp; Koyanagi  		2012) which sometimes do include supported employment. Exempt groups include,  		among others, certain institutionalized populations and those considered  		medically frail or having special medical needs--a category that specifically  		includes people with SMIs. Thus, newly eligible individuals with SMI may become  		eligible for supported employment even if those services are not covered in the  		alternative benefit plan in their state as long as they are covered in the  		Medicaid benefits specified in the state plan.</p>
<p>Although states are permitted to provide an alternative benefit package  		to newly eligible adults in non-exempt categories, they have the option of  		providing the state's full Medicaid package to these individuals (CMS 2012).  		Many states, in fact, are opting to use their state plan benefits as the  		coverage they provide to all newly eligible individuals, thereby avoiding the  		need to determine who qualifies as medically frail and eligible for state plan  		benefits instead of alternative benefits. Additionally, states may provide  		different alternative benefit plans targeted to different populations, so they  		can, if they wish, tailor benefits, including employment-support services to  		meet the unique needs of people with mental illnesses. States also have the  		option to provide additional "wraparound" benefits to people in alternative  		benefit plans (Bazelon Center 2012).</p>
<p>In any case, some aspects of supported employment cannot be covered by  		Medicaid without a waiver or adoption of the new 1915(i) state plan option  		described below, and thus additional wraparound funding from block grants and  		state funds will still be needed in some cases to provide access to these kinds  		of employment supports.</p>
<h3>Enhancements to the Medicaid Program</h3>
<p>In addition to expanding access to Medicaid, the ACA introduced new  		Medicaid options and enhanced existing options that may be used to make  		employment supports more widely available for people with mental illness,  		including those who are newly eligible for the program as well as those  		eligible under pre-ACA rules. The Medicaid Section 1915(i) state plan option is  		one such option. Added to the Social Security Act by the Deficit Reduction Act  		of 2005, 1915(i) is an option that states can use to offer home and  		community-based services (HCBS) to Medicaid beneficiaries, including those with  		mental illnesses. Prior to 2005, state Medicaid programs primarily provided  		HCBS through Medicaid Section (1915(c) waivers, which allow states to offer  		HCBS to beneficiaries who would otherwise require an institutional level of  		care (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005). But 1915(c) waivers have rarely been used  		to provide HCBS to people needing them as a result of mental illness because of  		the requirement that waiver services be cost-neutral<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note3">3</a></sup>--a challenging requirement for states to meet given  		that inpatient services provided in "institutions for mental diseases" are  		excluded from Medicaid reimbursement (Bazelon Center 2012). As an alternative  		to waivers, states that adopt the 1915(i) option are not required to  		demonstrate cost neutrality (Bazelon Center 2012); this provision expands the  		opportunity for states to fund HCBS, including employment supports, for people  		with mental illnesses. Moreover, unlike 1915(c) waivers, 1915(i) permits states  		to provide HCBS to individuals with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal  		poverty level without regard to whether such individuals need an institutional  		level of care (CMS 2010b).</p>
<p>The ACA made a number of changes to Section 1915(i) that may make the  		option even more useful for states wishing to provide employment and other  		community-based services to people with mental illnesses. First, the law  		expanded the types of services states can provide; in addition to services  		listed in statute, states may now offer "such other services requested by the  		state as the Secretary may approve" (CMS 2010b). These services could include  		all elements of a supported employment program (Wishon Siegmarth &amp; Koyanagi  		2012). This is significant since some elements of supported employment,  		including job placement and job coaching activities, cannot otherwise be  		covered by Medicaid. Additionally, the ACA gave states flexibility to offer  		different populations different services--varying in amount, duration, type,  		and scope. This change makes it possible for a state to target a 1915(i)  		benefit package specifically to persons with mental illness for evidence-based  		supported employment. The ACA also expanded financial eligibility criteria for  		1915(i) services to include a new optional Medicaid eligibility group of  		individuals with incomes up to 300 percent of the SSI federal benefit rate who  		are eligible for (though not necessarily enrolled in) HCBS under a 1915(c),  		1915(d), or 1915(e) waiver or 1115 demonstration in the state.<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note4">4</a></sup> Another amendment prohibited state waiting lists,  		which were permitted under the original authority, and required states to offer  		services statewide to all who are eligible, rather than limiting services to  		certain areas of the state (CMS 2010b).</p>
<p>Some observers have speculated that several of the ACA's amendments to  		1915(i) will deter widespread adoption (Justice 2011); states may be  		particularly reluctant to accept the prohibition of waiting lists, which  		eliminates their ability to control costs through enrollment caps.  		Nevertheless, states have great freedom in designing their needs-based  		criteria, which might serve as a lever for states to control eligibility and  		enrollment--and hence costs--by imposing stringent requirements. In addition,  		states may have a financial incentive to adopt the 1915(i) option in order to  		substitute federal Medicaid funds for the state and county funds that many  		currently use to provide services to adults with mental illness (Bazelon Center  		2012). Furthermore, the ability to target particular populations provides new  		flexibility states can use to offer comprehensive supported employment services  		while containing the costs by limiting their availability to individuals with  		very serious mental health conditions. As of April 2014, 14 states had an  		approved 1915(i) state plan option or plan to implement one in 2014 (Kaiser  		Family Foundation 2013).</p>
<p>The ACA also promotes the coordination of care for Medicaid  		beneficiaries, including supportive services for those with mental illnesses,  		through a handful of care coordination options. One such opportunity is the new  		Medicaid option to provide health home services to certain Medicaid  		beneficiaries. The health home model--based on the medical home concept--is  		intended to enhance coordination of medical care, behavioral health care, and  		community-based social services and supports for people with chronic illness,  		and it is therefore highly relevant to people with mental health needs (CMS  		2010a). If a state adopts the option, it is initially granted an increased  		federal matching rate for reimbursing providers that offer health home  		services<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note5">5</a></sup> to individuals with chronic  		disorders.<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note6">6</a></sup> Community mental health centers are  		among the providers that may serve as health homes (CMS 2010a). The care  		coordination to be provided through health homes creates the opportunity to  		link Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI to supported employment services as long  		as those services are covered by the state's Medicaid program--either the state  		plan, 1915(i) or some other option. In states that include supported employment  		in the state's Medicaid program, however, supported employment services  		provided through or coordinated by a health home should be covered by Medicaid  		for those who meet the needs-based criteria for them.</p>
<h3>Expanding Private Coverage</h3>
<p>In addition to creating opportunities for states to expand their  		Medicaid programs, the ACA expands access to private insurance through newly  		created health insurance exchanges It also makes a number of reforms to the way  		the private market operates. Both these steps may be beneficial to people with  		mental illness who are looking for work or who wish to retain their current  		job. Of those likely to become eligible for insurance through reforms to the  		private health insurance market, an estimated 6 percent are expected to have a  		SMI (Malone 2012). Though private plans are somewhat unlikely to cover a full  		range of employment-support services, increased availability of health  		insurance and consistent access to appropriate care are critical to a person's  		ability to maintain health and secure and retain employment. Moreover, there  		are types of employment supports that may more readily fit in private insurance  		benefit designs than comprehensive supported employment and that may be more  		appropriate for the milder forms of mental illness that are more prevalent  		among people engaged in employment.</p>
<p>In all states, certain people will be able to purchase insurance through  		a health insurance exchange, also known as the Health Insurance Marketplace, as  		of October 1, 2013 (HHS 2013a). In 2014, people with incomes between 100  		percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level who are not eligible for  		coverage through their employer or through public programs like Medicaid are  		eligible to receive premium tax credits to help them afford insurance through  		an exchange. Even individuals who are eligible for coverage through an employer  		can receive premium tax credits if the employer's share of the cost of coverage  		is less than 60 percent, or if the premium for individual coverage is more than  		9.5 percent of the person's income. In addition, to help limit out-of-pocket  		costs, cost-sharing subsidies are available to individuals with incomes at or  		below 250 percent of the federal poverty level (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012).  		In states that do not expand their Medicaid programs, those who are ineligible  		for Medicaid but who remain below 100 percent of the federal poverty level  		cannot receive premium tax credits and will likely be unable to afford private  		insurance on their own (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012).</p>
<p>Until the enactment of the ACA, coverage of mental health and substance  		use disorder benefits by any private insurers was optional. In addition,  		federal parity requirements under the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental  		Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 (Pub.L.No. 110-343,  		secs. 511-512) applied only to large group insurance plans--defined as those  		sponsored by employers with more than 50 employees (Sarata 2011). When mental  		health or substance use disorder services are covered, MHPAEA prohibits plans  		from imposing stricter financial requirements or treatment limitations on these  		benefits than they impose on most medical or surgical benefits. The parity  		requirements apply to both in-network and out-of-network benefits (Sarata  		2011).</p>
<p>The ACA expands access to mental health and substance use disorder  		services and rehabilitative services by requiring any new insurance plans  		offered in the individual or small-group market, both inside and outside of the  		exchanges, to cover the ten essential health benefits defined by the ACA  		(Kaiser Family Foundation 2012).<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note7">7</a></sup> Further, in  		implementing the essential health benefit provisions of the ACA, the U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has finalized regulations that  		extend federal parity requirements to the mental health and substance use  		disorder benefits that both small-group and individual plans must include  		(Beronio et al. 2013).<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>States have significant latitude in defining the scope of essential  		health benefits that individual and small-group plans must offer (Wishon  		Siegwarth &amp; Koyanagi 2012). States can choose a benchmark plan to define  		essential health benefits (HHS 2013b) and supplement those benefits to meet  		other ACA provisions including the application of federal parity rules to the  		mental health and substance use disorder benefits.<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note9">9</a></sup> Parity requirements coupled with the essential health  		benefit category of rehabilitative and habilitative services may encourage  		private insurance plans to consider including employment-support services for  		people with mental illnesses. The population of individuals covered by private  		insurance is likely to include many individuals with milder mental health  		conditions than those eligible for Medicaid, often including milder forms of  		depression and anxiety. Evidence-based practices do exist for helping  		individuals with these types of conditions; for example, the study cited  		earlier by Wang and others demonstrated that a telephone-based care management  		program targeted to employees with significant depression substantially  		improved job retention and hours worked (Wang 2007).</p>
<h2><a name="other" id="other">Other Insurance Reforms</a></h2>
<p>In addition to expanded access to insurance through Medicaid and health  		insurance exchanges, other reforms to the private insurance market made by the  		ACA may assist people with mental illnesses in accessing the services and  		supports they need to maintain health and the ability to work. Under the ACA,  		young adults can remain enrolled in a parent's employer-based or individual  		insurance plan until they reach age 26. This provision is particularly  		important for young adults who experience mental health symptoms. Young people  		often work in jobs that do not provide health insurance benefits, and many are  		unable to afford individual coverage. Unless they meet the Social Security  		Administration's definition of disability and have low earnings, making them  		eligible for SSI or SSDI benefits, and unless they live in a state that has  		expanded Medicaid, most are also ineligible for public health insurance  		coverage.<sup><a href="how-affordable-care-act-can-support-employment-people-mental-illness.html#note10">10</a></sup> People with behavioral health  		conditions often experience their first episode of SMIs or onset of substance  		use disorders in young adulthood (Kessler et al. 2007). Improved access to  		private insurance is therefore important to ensure that potentially disabling  		mental health symptoms are treated as they emerge.</p>
<p>Several other elements of the ACA may also help those with mental  		illnesses obtain health insurance and the support services they need to  		maintain employment. First, the law prohibits coverage denials due to an  		individual's pre-existing conditions (Altarum Institute 2010). Second, the law  		prohibits annual and lifetime limits on the dollar value of any essential  		health benefits provided. In addition, the ACA requires insurers to cover  		preventive services with no cost-sharing, including depression screening and  		screening and behavioral counseling for alcohol abuse. Finally, employers can  		no longer use wage levels to determine who within the company will be eligible  		for health insurance. This means that people who have lower-wage jobs should  		now have greater ability to gain insurance--which may include needed mental  		health and substance use disorder services and rehabilitation coverage--through  		their employers. In general, these reforms should improve access to private  		insurance coverage for individuals with behavioral health conditions and  		hopefully encourage employers to also provide access to employments supports  		that have been shown to improve workplace as well as clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>If providing behavioral health and employment-support services to those  		experiencing mental illness improves their ability to work and results in  		increased earnings, transitions between Medicaid and other insurance programs  		may be inevitable. For example, if the income of an individual newly eligible  		for Medicaid rises above 138 percent of the federal poverty level because of  		employment, the individual may no longer qualify for Medicaid coverage and  		would have to transition to other health insurance coverage (Koyanagi et al.  		2011). For people with continuing or recurring mental illnesses, such coverage  		transitions could seriously disrupt care, since the mental health and  		employment-support benefits, pharmaceuticals, and providers available under  		Medicaid would likely differ from those available through employer plans or the  		health insurance exchanges. Disruptions in care due to benefit differences  		could potentially hamper or even reverse progress made in health and  		employment, possibly resulting in relapse, job loss, and a renewed need and  		eligibility for Medicaid services or exchange subsidies. The cycle of gaining  		and losing Medicaid benefits has been referred to as "churning." To avoid  		churning and ensure that people with continuing or recurring mental illnesses  		have uninterrupted access to needed care, states may wish to consider closely  		aligning their Medicaid and private insurance coverage options.</p>
<h2><a name="looking" id="looking">Looking Ahead</a></h2>
<p>The ACA contains many important provisions that will improve access to  		health insurance coverage and health care for people with mental illness at  		risk of being disabled. Although the ACA is likely to expand access to health  		care services that may be important for maintaining employment, the extent to  		which private plans and state Medicaid programs will provide people with mental  		illnesses with supports they need to obtain and maintain employment is unknown.  		Requirements regarding essential health benefits and parity may encourage  		employers and private health plans to include employment supports for milder  		mental health conditions in their benefit packages in light of growing evidence  		that addressing mental health needs can help improve employment outcomes.  		Improving access to care regardless of disability status should also encourage  		individuals with more serious conditions to seek employment instead of  		remaining on SSDI in order to maintain their health care coverage.</p>
<p>Before the ACA, many people with chronic mental illness could obtain  		health insurance only by qualifying for SSDI or SSI on the basis of  		disability--that is, by proving that they could not work. Although these income  		support programs generally qualify beneficiaries for Medicare (SSDI) or  		Medicaid (SSI), beneficiaries who earn more than a set amount (called  		"substantial gainful activity" or SGA) may no longer qualify for income  		benefits and the health care coverage associated with them. The linkage between  		SSI/SSDI and Medicaid and Medicare eligibility, therefore, may encourage people  		with SMI and other disabilities to work less than they otherwise would in order  		to maintain critical health insurance benefits. Because the ACA begins to break  		this link, more people with SMI may be able to work without risking loss of the  		care needed to maintain their mental health. These individuals might lose  		income support if they engage in SGA, but employment is also likely to offer  		them substantial gains in mental health recovery and overall well-being.  		Moreover, increased employment among people with chronic mental illnesses and  		other disabilities has the additional advantage of potentially helping address  		the financing challenges of the SSI and SSDI programs. In order to enable  		individuals with behavioral health conditions to more fully achieve their  		employment potential, strategies are needed to build upon the opportunities in  		the ACA for improving access to employment supports.</p>

<p><a name="note1" id="note1">The</a> law expands eligibility to 133 percent of  			 the federal poverty level. A 5 percent income disregard established in the ACA  			 effectively raises this limit to 138 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Essential</a> health benefits include the following:  			 ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and  			 newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including  			 behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and  			 habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness  			 services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral  			 and vision care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">Cost</a> neutrality means that waiver services  			 offset institutional costs that would have been incurred to Medicaid absent the  			 waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">Section</a> 1915(d) and 1915(e) waivers provide HCBS  			 to individuals 65 and older and to children under age 5 who were infected with  			 HIV at birth, currently have AIDS, or were dependent on heroin, cocaine, or PCP  			 at birth, as long as those children would otherwise require  			 institutionalization. Section 1115 demonstrations are experimental or pilot  			 Medicaid programs approved for a five-year period that can be renewed for an  			 additional three years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Services</a> provided by a health home must include  			 comprehensive care management, care coordination and health promotion,  			 comprehensive transitional care from inpatient to other settings, individual  			 and family support, referral to community and social support services when  			 needed, and the use of health information technology when appropriate and  			 feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">Individuals</a> must: (1) have at least two chronic  			 conditions; (2) have one chronic condition and be at risk for another; or (3)  			 have one serious and persistent mental health condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">Grandfathered</a> plans are exempt from this  			 provision, meaning that individuals covered by a plan with grandfathered status  			 may remain without mental health benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">The</a> defines small-group coverage as that  			 sponsored by employers with fewer than 100 employees for non-federal  			 governmental plans. For group health plans and health insurance issuers subject  			 to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue  			 Code, those with 50 or fewer employees remain exempt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">A</a> benchmark plan may be: (1) the largest plan by  			 enrollment in any of the three largest products in the state's small-group  			 market; (2) any of the three largest state employee health benefit plan options  			 by enrollment; (3) any of the three largest national Federal Employees Health  			 Benefits Program plan options by enrollment; or (4) the largest insured  			 commercial health maintenance organization in the state. In states that fail to  			 select a plan, a default option will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">In</a> most states, SSI eligibility automatically  			 qualifies an individual for Medicaid. To be eligible for SSI based on  			 disability, one must have a physical or mental impairment that results in an  			 inability to perform SGA, and that can be expected to result in death or has  			 lasted or is expected to last for at least 12 months. In general, individuals  			 who do not receive SSI but seek Medicaid coverage based on disability must  			 prove they have an impairment that prevents them from performing SGA for at  			 least a year. SSDI eligibility automatically qualifies an individual for  			 Medicare, but eligibility for SSDI benefits requires a work history through  			 which the applicant has paid SSDI taxes, and many young people have not yet  			 worked enough to qualify. Moreover, Medicare eligibility does not begin until  			 24 months of SSDI benefit receipt, leaving many young people with serious  			 mental health care needs uninsured during an extended period of  			 disability.</p>
