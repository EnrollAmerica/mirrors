<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>In April 1999, a report entitled "<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/ifpattrn.htm">A Descriptive Analysis  		of Patterns of Informal and Formal Caregiving among Privately Insured and  		Non-Privately Insured Disabled Elders Living in the Community</a>" was  		submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Robert Wood  		Johnson Foundation. The purpose of that report was to provide basic descriptive  		statistics on disabled policyholders of private long-term care (LTC) insurance  		who had accessed insurance benefits in the community. Information about these  		individuals and their service use was compared to similar data among  		non-insured disabled community-dwelling elders.</p>
<p> As part of the study the primary informal caregivers of these disabled  		insured claimants were also interviewed. These were the individuals identified  		by the claimant as helping the most with everyday activities but who did not  		receive payment for doing so. In the April report, we showed that these  		individuals continued to provide a great deal of care even as the claimant  		received substantial amounts of formal (paid) care. Moreover, many of the  		informal caregivers indicated that they had not reduced the amount of care they  		were providing to their disabled care-receiver since receipt of insurance  		benefits. Finally, an overwhelming majority of informal caregivers said that  		the presence of insurance-financed formal care had reduced the level of stress  		associated with caregiving.</p>
<p> The focus of the April report was on claimants. The purpose of this  		supplementary report is to provide more information and greater detail on the  		primary informal caregivers (ICG) of disabled private LTC insurance  		policyholders who have accessed long-term care benefits and are living in the  		community. We also compare key characteristics of these individuals to informal  		caregivers of non-privately insured disabled elders.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Caregiver effort expended on privately insured  		and non-privately insured disabled community-dwelling elders is measured as  		well. Finally, we evaluate caregiver perceptions regarding the value of the LTC  		insurance policy and summarize and discuss the implications of findings.</p>
<p>Key findings are presented below.</p>
<h3>The Demographic Profile of Informal Caregivers</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Informal caregivers of privately insured disabled elders are often  			 elders themselves, are well educated, typically female, and people who  			 generally enjoy high economic status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A large number of ICGs are married to their care-receivers. The  			 majority of informal caregivers for the privately insured are spouses, whereas  			 for the non-privately insured, relatives other than a spouse provide the bulk  			 of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not formal care substitutes for informal care is related  			 to the demographics of the caregiver. For adult children it is more common for  			 formal care to substitute for informal care, but this is not generally the case  			 for spouses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mere 6% of caregivers of the privately insured has children under  			 the age of 25 living in their homes. Thus, while the problems of the "sandwich"  			 caregivers are important and socially significant, it must be emphasized that  			 this group is not a substantial component of this sample of informal  			 caregivers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Care Provided by Informal Caregivers</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The majority of the caregivers in our sample reported that they have  			 been providing informal care to the insured for four years or less (83%), with  			 most saying they have provided care for between two and four years  			 (69%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On average, ICGs help claimants with 2.6 ADLs. As the severity of  			 ADL dependency increases (i.e. more ADLs), the likelihood that a spouse will be  			 the ICG increases. Only 30% of non-spousal ICGs care for claimants with five or  			 six ADLs, compared to 40% of spousal ICGs in that category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caregivers provide an average of 39 hours of help per week, with a  			 median of 24 hours. For those ICGs that were working more than 30 hours per  			 week, this average drops to 19 hours of help per week with a median of 12  			 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spousal ICGs caring for severely disabled claimants (e.g. those with  			 five to six ADL limitations) are much more likely to provide 40 or more hours  			 per week of care than are children caring for similarly disabled individuals --  			 56% versus 18%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid helpers provide complementary help to unpaid caregivers. Where  			 the ICG is providing eight hours per week or less of ADL help, paid help also  			 tends to be low. Where the ICG is providing large amounts of ADL help there are  			 more frequent uses of paid help for large blocks of time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Employment Status</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Thirty-five percent (35%) of informal caregivers of privately  			 insured disabled elderly are currently working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 10% of spousal ICGs were currently employed, while employment  			 was much higher among child and child-in-law ICGs -- about two in  			 three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average weekly hours worked for employed ICGs was 38.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact of Caregiving on Employment</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The effects of caregiving on the employment of ICGs are pervasive  			 and wide-ranging. The responsibility of providing care for a disabled elder  			 does not mean that one simply leaves the labor force or fails to enter it. It  			 also affects the amount of time one is able to work, the quality of work one is  			 capable of performing, whether or not one can search for a new job or even  			 whether one can seriously consider the offer of a new job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 7% of all respondents (and 18% of child ICGs) indicated that  			 they had stopped work in order to take care of the disabled claimant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About two-in-five working caregivers said they are currently working  			 fewer hours due to caregiving and two-in-five non-working caregivers indicated  			 that at some point in the past, they had worked fewer hours per week than they  			 would have liked because they were helping the claimant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forty percent (40%) also stated that they had to take time off  			 without pay with an average of 17 days of work missed per year due to caring  			 for a disabled elder. This represents about 8% of the work year. The average  			 earnings of these employed caregivers are $67,417. Thus, these lost workdays  			 translate to lost earnings of $5,393 per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 85% of those who were employed answered that they had at some  			 time had to rearrange their job schedule because of caregiving  			 responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sixteen percent (16%) reported that caregiving had kept them from  			 looking for a job and another 11% had to turn down a job because of the care  			 that they were providing. For spousal ICGs, those who had been kept from  			 looking or who had to turn down a job was less than 10%, but 27% of child ICGs  			 had been kept from looking and 20% had had to turn down a job.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact of Caregiving on Emotional Well-being and  		Stress</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>More than half of the informal caregivers (58%) responded that  			 caregiving bothered them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over half (55%) stated that they do not sleep through the night as a  			 result of providing care. If one only looks at the instances where the  			 caregiver and care-receiver are living with one another, 66% of caregivers say  			 that their sleep is interrupted because of the care they provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing care has more of an emotional effect on caregivers than  			 physical although about one-quarter of the respondents agreed that caring  			 caused their health to get worse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most informal caregivers reported that caregiving is hard on them  			 emotionally and limits their privacy and social or free time. Moreover, many  			 feel that the care-receiver needs medical care that they cannot provide and  			 that they have to provide the care-receiver with constant attention.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Comparing Informal Caregiving of Privately Insured and  		Non-Privately Insured Community-Dwelling Disabled Elders<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Informal caregivers of the privately insured disabled tend to be  			 older, more highly educated, and enjoy higher incomes than their counterparts  			 caring for the disabled without private insurance. Moreover, they are more  			 likely to be married.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informal caregivers of the privately insured disabled are about four  			 times more likely to be employed than are those caring for non-privately  			 insured disabled elders -- 35% compared to 9%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caregivers caring for disabled individuals without private insurance  			 are more likely to live with them. There is also a greater likelihood that  			 these caregivers are adult children, many of whom are unmarried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On average, informal caregivers of the privately insured report  			 providing about 40 hours a week of assistance compared to about 42 hours for  			 those caring for non-privately insured disabled elders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among employed caregivers, those caring for the privately insured  			 are more likely to have to take time off without pay, to have to rearrange  			 their work schedule to accommodate the care needs of the care-receiver, and  			 have had to quit a job to continue to provide care.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Impact of Private Long-Term Care Insurance on  		Caregiving</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>About two-in-three caregivers indicated that the presence of  			 insurance-financed formal care has reduced their general stress level.</p>

</ul><h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p> One of the most important findings of this study is that despite caring  		for very disabled elders, many caregivers of privately insured care-receivers  		are able to continue to work, especially adult children caregivers. While they  		may continue to experience inconveniences (e.g. having to rearrange their  		schedule, missing days of care, and others) they have not had to drop out of  		the labor force completely.</p>
<p> The differences in care provision and caregiving experience between  		spousal and non-spousal caregivers is stark. For the most part, spousal  		caregivers care for the most disabled claimants, provide more weekly hours of  		care, and provide much more hands-on assistance with basic activities of daily  		living. Even when the disability level of the care-receiver is held constant,  		spousal caregivers provide much more care than do non-spousal caregivers. Not  		surprisingly, they also experience greater emotional stress.</p>
<p> Informal and formal caregiving appear to be complementary. The presence  		of insurance-financed formal care does not significantly reduce the magnitude  		of caregiver effort. This effort does entail certain self-perceived health  		risks. Roughly one-quarter of caregivers indicated that their health had  		worsened as a result of their caregiving activities. How to minimize such risks  		should be an important component of caregiver training and support.</p>
<p> Not captured by the quantitative data are the individual experiences of  		caregivers themselves. While caregivers indicated that the presence of  		insurance does reduce their general level of stress they continue to experience  		daily difficulties even when significant amounts of formal care are provided.  		Many respondents just wanted to have the ability to talk to someone about their  		caregiving experience. They also indicated that they could use additional  		information about how to be more effective and how to cope with the daily  		stresses of caregiving. Finally, many indicated that they were not adequately  		prepared to provide care. The implication is that even when private insurance  		is available to finance significant amounts of care, ongoing support for  		informal caregivers is needed. Such support needs to address the emotional, and  		for some, the physical aspects associated with caregiving.</p>
<h2><a name="section1" id="section1">I. BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p> The population of Americans who require or are at risk of requiring  		help with personal care and other daily functional tasks is growing rapidly.  		This is primarily due to the growth rate of the elderly population --  		especially those aged 85 and older. The proportion of the elderly requiring  		personal assistance ranges from 9% of those aged 65 to 69 to well over 50% of  		those aged 85 and over (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). Between 1990 and 2000 alone,  		the U.S. population aged 65 and older grew by 12%, and the population aged 85  		and older by 50%. This population growth among persons at high risk of  		disability cannot help but create a rising demand for long-term care (LTC)  		services.</p>
<p> LTC expenditures (i.e. expenditures on nursing homes and related  		facilities, in-home registered nurse and home health aide visits, and other  		home and community-based services) now account for almost 12% of total personal  		health expenditures -- a three-fold increase since 1960. Among people aged 65  		and older, LTC expenditures account for 28% of personal health expenditures  		(21% for nursing home services and 7% for home and community-based care). This  		percentage is especially noteworthy given that only one-in-four older Americans  		with functional disabilities reside in nursing homes and related facilities.  		Among disabled elders who continue to reside in the community, two-thirds use  		no formal (paid) LTC services at all, relying exclusively on the informal  		(unpaid) help provided by family, friends, and neighbors.</p>
<p>Many studies have attempted to profile these informal helpers of  		disabled elders (See: Penrod, Kane, R.A., Kane, R.L. &amp; Finch, 1995; NAC,  		1998; Tennstedt, 1999) and more recently, to estimate the cost or value of  		unpaid caregiving. One recent study estimates the economic value of informal  		caregiving to be close to $200 billion per year (Arno, 1999). It stands to  		reason that with the growing elderly population and a public that is reluctant  		to pay for LTC, the likelihood of caring for an elderly relative or friend will  		also increase. Currently, about one-in-four households are providing some form  		of care to an ill or disabled relative (NAC, 1997).</p>
<p> Not surprisingly, informal caregiving is gaining widespread recognition  		and support among policymakers and practitioners alike. In his 1999 State of  		the Union message, President Clinton recommended that in recognition of the  		financial burden imposed by informal caregiving, a tax credit of up to $1,000  		per year be available to those caring for disabled relatives.</p>
<p> In the past, studies have looked at who is providing informal care and  		the various effects caregiving has on them physically, emotionally and  		financially. One of the most common critiques of prior research is that it  		attempts to understand the caregiver independent and often irrespective of the  		care-receiver (Barer &amp; Johnson, 1990). When trying to get an overall  		picture of caregiving, it is important not only to gather information about the  		caregiver, but to understand in detail the characteristics of the care-receiver  		as well. This is because the caregiving experience is intimately linked to the  		health and functional status of the care-receiver. Additionally, few studies  		have looked closely at important subgroups like male and female caregivers,  		those with public or private insurance, or caregiving across racial or ethnic  		groups.</p>
<p> Most disabled elders prefer to remain living at home instead of moving  		to an institution or facility. The recent growth in the private LTC insurance  		market and the increasing popularity of policies covering home and  		community-based care, has made remaining at home longer a more realistic  		possibility for those who have such insurance. Currently, more than 6 million  		policies have been sold to individuals, primarily age 65 and older. While some  		studies have looked at the experience of informal caregivers of disabled elders  		in the general population, not much is known about informal caregivers of  		disabled elders with private LTC insurance. For example, we do not know how a  		disabled person's having access to insurance benefits that pay for home health  		aides and other personal care workers affect the level of support or overall  		experience of their informal caregivers of these privately insured disabled  		elders. It is the objective of this study to investigate the identity,  		behavior, and attitudes of informal caregivers of disabled and privately  		insured elders.</p>
<p> The current study of informal caregivers is part of a larger study on  		Long-Term Care Insurance Claimants, funded by the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), Office of Disability, Aging and  		Long-Term Care Policy and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The principal  		report was completed in April 1999 and is entitled: "<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/ifpattrn.htm">A Descriptive Analysis  		of Patterns of Informal and Formal Caregiving among Privately Insured and  		Non-Privately Insured Disabled Elders Living in the Community</a>." The overall  		study can be separated into a number of components, but three are fundamental:  		LTC insurance claimants who reside in the community, LTC insurance claimants  		who reside in institutional settings and informal caregivers. There are many  		elements that connect these three groups, but attention to the individual  		pieces is essential. It is only by focusing separately on each of these three  		groups that one can get a clear view of who they are, what their attitudes are,  		and how they behave in an insured context.</p>
<p> The impact of LTC insurance on behavior is a puzzle. We know relatively  		little about how people will react and respond to the presence of such  		insurance, and to the payment of benefits resulting from claims under the  		insurance. The behavior of informal caregivers associated with LTC insurance  		claimants is a key piece of that puzzle. In most cases the experience of  		informal care is one that is outside the environment of LTC insurance. What we  		call <i>informal</i> care is the type of care, which has been fairly  		traditional in nature, that is, care provided by family and friends. Formal  		care, or paid care, is more the innovation.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> What we know about informal caregivers and the  		care they provide, from an uninsured environment, is not very helpful in  		predicting the care provided in an insured environment.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p> The informal caregivers studied in this report are unique in a number  		of ways: they are caregivers of people who would be willing (and, not  		unimportantly, able) to purchase LTC insurance; they were providing care  		following the commencement of insurance benefits and probably prior to that  		flow of benefits; and, they are all currently providing care to disabled  		elders.</p>
<p> Of course these informal caregivers are unique in another fundamental  		way -- they are the roughly four hundred people being studied. They are people  		with individual qualities, qualifications, and characteristics.</p>
<h2><a name="section2" id="section2">II. PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p> The purpose of this report is to provide basic descriptive statistics  		on the primary informal caregivers (ICG) of disabled private LTC insurance  		policyholders who have accessed LTC benefits and are living in the community.  		We also compare key characteristics of these individuals to informal caregivers  		of non-privately insured disabled elders. In this report we:</p>
<ul><li> provide a profile of informal caregivers of disabled privately  		  insured claimants and compare them to a profile of informal caregivers of  		  non-privately insured disabled individuals;</li>
<li> measure caregiver effort on behalf of privately insured  		  community-based claimants and compare this to caregiver effort for disabled  		  non-privately insured elders living in the community;</li>
<li> evaluate caregiver perceptions regarding the value of the LTC  		  insurance policy; and</li>
<li> summarize and discuss the implications of findings.</li>
</ul><h2><a name="section3" id="section3">III. METHOD</a></h2>
<h3>A. Data</h3>
<p><b><i>Sources of Information</i></b></p>
<p>The initial data for the study is a database consisting of privately  		insured disabled elders. Eight of the largest LTC insurance companies in the  		U.S. participated in the study and each contributed a sample of claimants  		residing in the community. These companies also provided data from their  		administrative and claim systems to supplement information collected directly  		from claimants. The claimants themselves identified their ICG as part of a  		personal interview.</p>
<p>The participating companies included: (1) Aegon; (2) American  		Travellers; (3) Bankers Life and Casualty; (4) CNA Insurance; (5) Fortis  		Long-Term Care; (6) G.E. Capital Assurance; (7) John Hancock; and (8)  		UnumProvident. Together their claimant blocks represent more than 80% of all  		open home health care claims and nursing home claims.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> These companies represent diverse market  		segments and policy designs, and employ differing underwriting and claims  		management strategies.</p>
<p><b><i>Data Collection</i></b></p>
<p> Data from all privately insured home care claimants were gathered via  		in-person interviews conducted by trained nurses and social workers with at  		least two years of geriatric experience. We collected information from informal  		caregivers via telephone interviews. Clinical nurses specializing in the field  		of geriatrics conducted these telephone interviews, which typically took  		between 20 and 30 minutes to complete. Each interviewer underwent extensive  		training on the survey instrument to assure interrater reliability. The  		research team completed all fieldwork between November 1997 and February  		1999.</p>
<p> It is important to note that each completed survey underwent a detailed  		quality review. In some cases, surveys had to be returned to the interviewer  		either because certain data elements were not complete or because of the  		presence of data discrepancies. While time consuming, this process led to the  		collection of reliable and accurate self-reported information.</p>
<h3>B. Sample</h3>
<p> Our sample of informal caregivers is derived from the sample of LTC  		insurance claimants living in the community. To be included in the claimant  		sample, individuals had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li> They had to be at least 65 years old;</li>
<li> They had to be classified as an active claimant by the insurance  		  company, having already received at least one payment for home/community-based  		  services;</li>
<li> They had to be living in the "community" (i.e. not living in an  		  institution such as assisted living or nursing home); and</li>
<li> They had to have a policy that covered both nursing home care and  		  home care.</li>
</ul><p> As part of the interview, claimants were asked a series of questions  		about helpers who provided services to them. Specifically, they were asked,  		"Who is the person that regularly helps you the most with your everyday  		activities but does not receive monetary payment for doing so?" The helper thus  		identified is treated as the ICG. This information was also verified with the  		identified ICG at the time that we arranged for the phone interview. The  		proportion of the claimant population that identified someone as their ICG was  		77%. Of the 461 ICGs that we reached by telephone, 424 or 92% participated in  		the study.</p>
<p><b><i>Response Rates</i></b></p>
<p><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table1"> Table 1</a> displays the response rates by the  		insurance company for the informal caregivers who were located and contacted.  		As shown, we achieved high response rates for this analytic sample. The lowest  		response rate for a particular company was 83% and the highest was 95%.</p>

<h3>A. Profiling Informal Caregivers of Private Long-Term  		Care Insurance Claimants</h3>
<p><b><i>Demographic Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table2">Table 2</a> provides a detailed look at the  		demographic profile of informal caregivers for privately insured claimants. It  		is important to note that the care-receivers (or claimants) were the ones who  		identified the ICGs. In most other studies of informal caregiving, the  		caregiver is self-selected; that is, the caregiver is responsible for  		identifying himself or herself as the person who provides unpaid  		care.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p> As shown, these caregivers are well-educated, typically female, and  		people who generally enjoy relatively high economic status. These  		characteristics are similar to those of the population that tends to purchase  		LTC insurance.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note7">7</a></font></sup> The ICGs  		ranged in age from 32 to 92, with an average age of 65. Although the range of  		ages is wide, there was a concentration of ICGs who were in their seventies and  		eighties. This is most likely due to the fact that most (53%) of ICGs are  		spouses of disabled claimants (see <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>). When  		looking at only non-spousal ICGs, the age range was 32 to 88, with an average  		age of 53. Although most caregivers are female, the number of male informal  		caregivers is also substantial. Traditionally, informal caregivers are thought  		to be female -- daughters or daughters-in-law. The fact that the majority of  		ICGs were spouses and that the majority of claimants (68%) were females might  		account for the large number of males.</p>
<p> Eighty-one percent (81%) of ICGs are married. This is somewhat  		misleading, though, because so many ICGs are spouses of claimants. If one  		focuses exclusively on the non-spousal ICGs, only 57% are married. The marital  		status of ICGs who are children of claimants is also relevant. Sixty-two  		percent (62%) of daughter ICGs are married, but only 51% of sons who are  		ICGs.</p>

</tr></table><p> A number of factors enter into the determination of who serves as the  		ICG. Because the ICG identified is the person who helps the most, the amount of  		time available on the part of the caregivers matters. Similarly, geographic  		proximity to the claimant matters. A third factor of substantial importance is  		willingness to provide care without reimbursement or pay. The ICG would most  		likely be someone who cares a great deal about the well being of the claimant.  		All of these considerations lead one to suspect that the marital status of the  		claimant would play the most important role in the determination of the  		identity of the ICG. If a claimant is married, it is reasonable to expect that  		the spouse will be the ICG. (That is, marriage is a pre-condition to having a  		spouse as primary ICG, but it is not the only factor.) As is apparent, the most  		common connection between caregiver and claimant is marriage.</p>
<p> It should be pointed out that the proportion of married disabled  		individuals in the two samples is similar. Thus, it is striking to note that  		the majority of informal caregivers for the privately insured are spouses,  		whereas for the non-privately insured, it is relatives and others rather than a  		spouse that provide the bulk of care. Still, spouses represent the single  		largest category of informal caregiver for both groups. Put simply, marital  		status is the principal determinant of who will be the ICG. This finding may  		indicate that in the insured environment, if formal care does substitute for  		informal care the substitution could be selective. That is, it appears as if  		the formal care financed by insurance benefits may substitute for the care  		provided by adult children but not necessarily for the care provided by a  		spouse. This accords with previous research indicating that a primary  		motivation for the purchase of private LTC insurance is to "...avoid being a  		burden on family members" (Cohen &amp; Kumar, 1996). Data here suggests that  		the family members on whom disabled elders do not want to be a burden are adult  		children, typically daughters and daughters-in-law.</p>
<p> The pattern of relying on a spouse for caregiving holds up even when  		one focuses exclusively on claimants with living children. For married  		claimants with children, 89% identified their ICG as their husband or wife, and  		10% identified a child as ICG. By contrast, for widow(er)s and divorced  		claimants with children, 86% of the ICGs were their children.</p>
<p> It is not unusual for caregivers to have responsibilities for both  		someone older than they are and someone younger. The common concern in this  		regard is for ICGs who must look after a parent and one or more children.  		<a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure2">Figure 2</a> shows that 84% of all ICGs have children.  		Typically, these ICGs have two children. Obviously, there is concern with these  		so-called "sandwich" caregivers who may be called upon to care for both parents  		and children. Yet, among the privately insured, a mere 6% have children under  		the age of 25 living in their homes. In a recent study of 1,509 caregivers, 41%  		had children under age 18 in the household (NAC, 1997).<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> Thus, while the problems of the "sandwich"  		caregivers are important and socially significant, it must be emphasized that  		this group is not an important component of this sample of ICGs caring for the  		privately insured.</p>

<p><b><i>Employment Status of Informal Caregiver</i></b></p>
<p> There has been much written, particularly recently, on caregiving and  		employment (See Arno, et al, 1999; MetLife, 1999). One can imagine that working  		full-time and providing care to a disabled elder can take a toll on a person's  		work and personal life. Informal caregivers in our sample were asked a variety  		of questions about their employment status and history. Participants were asked  		if they are currently working for pay at a job or business. Only 35% of  		informal caregivers of privately insured disabled elderly are currently  		working. This is not surprising given that the average age of caregivers in our  		sample is 65.</p>
<p><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure4">Figure 4</a> shows the breakdown of employment status  		by the nature of the relationship between the ICG and the claimant. As shown,  		only 10% of spousal ICGs were currently employed, while employment was much  		higher among child and child-in-law ICGs -- about two-in-three.</p>
<p> Caregivers who were currently working reported their usual amount of  		work per week. Most of the working ICGs were employed at or close to full-time.  		Only 22% were working less than 30 hours per week. The average number of hours  		worked by employed ICGs was 38.</p>

<p> The main reason given by spousal ICGs for having ended employment was  		retirement. The reasons given by child ICGs were much more varied, with the  		largest number responding either "to retire" or "to take care of home and  		family." Only 7% of all respondents (and 18% of child ICGs) indicated that they  		had stopped work in order to take care of the disabled claimant.</p>
<h3>B. The Nature of Informal Care</h3>
<p>As shown, for the most part, ICGs of privately insured community-based  		claimants are spouses and adult children. It is important to examine the kinds  		of activities these helpers help with and how much and how long they have been  		helping. As shown in <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure6">Figure 6</a>, the majority of the  		caregivers in our sample reported that they have been providing informal care  		to the insured for 4 years or less (83%), with most saying they have provided  		care for between one and four years (69%).<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note10">10</a></font></sup> Also noteworthy is the fact that about half  		of caregivers have increased the amount of care they provide to the claimant  		since the onset of disability. This likely reflects the continued decline in  		functioning of the care-receiver.</p>

</tr></table><p> On average, ICGs help claimants with 2.6 ADLs. The average number of  		reported ADL limitations experienced by claimants was 3.3. The difference in  		the number of ADLs for which care is being supplied and received -- .7 ADLs --  		suggests the involvement of formal caregivers to make up the difference or that  		needs are not being completely met. The most common activities that informal  		caregivers help with are dressing (52%) and transferring (46%). Note that these  		activities require the least amount of professional training and may be less  		intrusive from a privacy perspective.</p>
<p> <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure8">Figure 8</a> displays the association between the  		number of ADL limitations requiring assistance and the identity of the ICG. ADL  		limitations are broken into three groups: less than three, three or four, and  		more than four. As shown, as the severity of ADL dependency increases (i.e.  		more ADLs), the likelihood that a spouse will be the ICG increases.</p>
<p> Only 30% of non-spousal ICGs care for claimants with five or six ADLs,  		compared to 40% of spousal ICGs in that category. A likely explanation for this  		is that non-spousal caregivers, who typically do not live with the disabled  		care-receiver, would be unable to provide the time needed to care for someone  		with five or six ADLs. In contrast, spousal caregivers can more successfully  		maintain a severely disabled individual in the home. A disabled elder with a  		spouse can remain at home more easily given the attention of the spouse. Such  		attention would not be as readily available to unmarried claimants. Thus,  		compared to spousal caregivers, non-spousal caregivers are more likely to care  		for less disabled individuals. There was no particular association of ICG type  		with the presence of cognitive impairment among care-receivers.</p>

As  		shown in <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure9">Figure 9</a>, this is in fact the case; money  		management, grocery shopping and meal preparation are the most common  		activities performed by ICGs on behalf of the disabled care-receiver. ICGs help  		with an average of 4.7 IADLs.</p>
<p> If an ICG said that he or she helped with a particular activity,  		additional questions were asked to determine how often and how much time the  		activity required. For each activity, ICGs identified how many days in the past  		week they assisted and how many hours per day. On average caregivers provide  		care six days per week. Caregivers were also asked a general question regarding  		the number of hours they regularly help in one week. This measure could also  		include time spent just being with the insured (i.e. companionship) or doing  		other activities related to expressive needs, not necessarily related to direct  		ADL or IADL care. For this question, all ICGs reported an average of almost 39  		hours of help provided per week, with a median of 24 hours. For those ICGs that  		were employed more than 30 hours/week, this drops to 19 hours of help provided  		per week with a median of 12 hours.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>

Consider claimants  		who can function independently in only three or fewer ADLs. More than 60% of  		their ICGs provide 20 hours per week or less of care. By comparison, over half  		of the ICGs who assist claimants with five or six ADLs provide over 30 hours  		per week of care.</p>
<p> The same pattern persists for claimants suffering from cognitive  		impairment. Caregivers of the cognitively impaired spend much more time  		providing care than do caregivers of the cognitively intact. In fact, about 42%  		of the ICGs caring for cognitively impaired individuals spend more than 40  		hours per week doing so; this compares to about 30% of the ICGs providing care  		to the cognitively intact.</p>

Do different ICGs offer  		differing amounts of care? If spouses are more likely to care for severely  		disabled claimants, it would seem likely that they would also offer more hours  		per week of care. But will spouses who care for the severely disabled offer  		more hours per week of care than children or others that provide care for the  		severely disabled? The answer is yes. Spousal ICGs caring for severely disabled  		claimants (e.g. those with five or six ADL limitations) are much more likely to  		provide 40 or more hours per week of care than are children caring for  		similarly disabled individuals -- 56% versus 18%. The latter either have  		greater amounts of formal care or greater levels of unmet need.</p>
<p> Another question relates to whether the efforts of paid and unpaid  		caregivers overlap. In other words, do paid and unpaid helpers complement or  		substitute for each other in terms of the number of hours of care they provide.  		As shown in <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure11">Figure 11</a>, paid helpers provide  		complementary help. Where the ICG is providing eight hours or less of ADL help,  		paid help also tends to be low. Where the ICG is providing large amounts of ADL  		help there are more frequent uses of paid help for large blocks of time.</p>
<p> Finally, although not shown in <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure11">Figure 11</a>, when  		the ICG is a child of the claimant, it is unusual for the child to provide very  		large amounts of ADL help. In fact, in the cases where ADL help provided by  		child ICGs is less than eight hours, paid help is often substantial. For  		spousal ICGs, it is much more common for large quantities of ADL help to be  		provided, and paid help does complement the efforts of the ICG.</p>

</tr></table><h3>C. The Caregiving Experience</h3>
<p> We also wanted to measure how caregiving affected the lives of those  		who provide the care. In order to do this we asked a series of questions  		related to work, health and emotional status. First, for those providing care  		we wanted to know over the course of their caregiving experience, did they  		provide more, less or about the same amount of care at the time of the  		interview as they did when they first began caring for the claimant. Half of  		respondents indicated that they now provide more care then when they began and  		the other half were split fairly evenly between less care and the same amount  		of care. Given that these are chronically disabled elders living in the  		community, it makes sense that many would require more care as time progresses.  		As a rule, the disabled elders in our sample tend to need more help with  		everyday activities as time goes on and their level of functioning slowly  		deteriorates, rather than improves. Thus, even though insurance encourages the  		use of formal (paid) help, informal caregivers often wind up providing more  		care or the same amount of care now.</p>
<p><b><i>Residency</i></b></p>
<p> The provision of informal care has important implications for  		residency. In its simplest form, the matter comes down to the question: With  		whom does the claimant live? Much has been written about the relationship  		between caregiving, the costs of providing care, and residency (Borsch-Supan et  		al, 1996). The question of residency, or co-residency, is especially important  		because the ease and cost of providing care for a disabled elder are seriously  		influenced by living arrangement. If the ICG and claimant live together they  		will have an entirely different relationship than if they live apart.  		Naturally, the principal determinant of the living situation is the  		relationship between the claimant and the caregiver.</p>
<p> If one approaches the question from the perspective of the claimant,  		one-third of claimants live alone and 44% live with a spouse. It is more  		interesting to approach the question from the perspective of the ICG. Most ICGs  		live with their care-receivers (over two-thirds), but this observation is  		dominated by spouses. Where the ICG is a child, 36% live with their disabled  		parent, and where the ICG is someone else 28% co-reside. Finally, the ICGs who  		were most likely to have claimants living with them were those who had never  		been married; 66% of the unmarried ICGs lived with claimants.</p>
<p> Regarding the disability status of the claimant, the greater number of  		ADLs for which assistance is necessary, the more likely it is that the claimant  		will reside with the ICG. Even so, while claimants with the higher number of  		ADL dependencies are more likely to live with their caregiver, it is still true  		that the majority of them live independently. Income, however, does show an  		association with living arrangement: as the ICG's income rises, the likelihood  		of the claimant living with the ICG falls.</p>
<p> For ICGs with incomes less than $30,000, two-thirds of them live with  		their claimants. For ICGs with incomes above $70,000, only 18% live with their  		claimants. This observed behavior is consistent with two explanations. One is  		that for lower income ICGs the additional income brought by a claimant is  		desirable. This income (retirement income or social security) would supplement  		the caregiver's income and allow for a higher standard of living. The other is  		that as income increases the ICG would prefer to live independently of the  		claimant.</p>
<p> Caregiving often requires the continual presence of the helper and  		monitoring of the disabled individual. We asked ICGs whether caring for a  		disabled elder was the impetus for changing residence. Specifically, we asked  		whether the non-spousal ICG had to change geographic location to be closer to  		their loved one or whether they had to move in with them. <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure12">Figure 12</a> below shows that overall most non-spousal  		caregivers (75%) did not have to change their residence or move-in with the  		claimant because of his or her disability.</p>
<p> Of those that did not live together at the time of interview, we asked  		if the <i>insured</i> ever changed his or her place of residence or moved in  		with the caregiver because of disability. These percentages were higher.  		Thirty-four percent (34%) of the caregivers reported that the insured had to  		move closer or in with them. There is a greater willingness or ability for the  		ICGs to take their loved ones into their homes than to change their own  		residence.</p>

<p> We designed a number of questions to assess the impact of providing  		care to the employment of the claimant. Of all caregivers in our sample, 36%  		reported that they were working for pay at the time of the interview and 64% of  		non-spousal caregivers reported working. For all working caregivers, we asked  		several questions relating to the amount of time, if any, they had to miss work  		in order to provide care for their disabled elder. <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table3">Table  		3</a> summarizes working caregivers' responses to a series of questions  		relating to how informal caregiving affects the work life of the ICG.</p>
<p> First, we wanted to determine if the caregiver was perhaps working less  		than he or she would like due to caregiving responsibilities. In fact, 40% of  		working caregivers said they are currently employed fewer hours than they would  		like. Those that were not currently working fewer hours were asked if they ever  		had done so in the past. Again, 40% responded that at some point in the past  		they had worked fewer hours per week than they would have liked because they  		were helping the claimant. Forty percent (40%) of the caregivers also stated  		that they had to take time off without pay with an average of 17 days of work  		missed per year due to caring for a disabled elder. These 17 days represent  		about 8% of the work year. The average earnings of these employed caregivers is  		$67,417. Thus, these lost workdays translate to lost earnings of $5,393 per  		year.</p>

All told, slightly  		more than one-in-three informal caregivers indicated that their employment had  		been affected by their caregiving role. Finally, we asked those who were not  		working, if they would have continued working longer were they not taking care  		of the disabled claimant. Overall, 20% of caregivers said that they would have  		continued working longer, but when looking only at adult children (in-law),  		this increases to 43%.</p>
<p> The effects of caregiving on the employment of ICGs are pervasive and  		wide-ranging. The responsibility of providing care for a disabled elder does  		not mean that one simply leaves the labor force or fails to enter it. It can  		also affect the amount of time one is able to work (per week), the quality of  		work one is capable of performing, whether or not one can search for a new job  		or even whether one can seriously consider the offer of a new job.</p>
<p><b><i>Caregiver Emotional Well Being</i></b></p>
<p> Providing care to a disabled elderly friend or relative can cause  		stress on a caregiver's living and working arrangements, but it can have some  		of its most profound effects on the caregiver's physical and emotional health.  		We asked caregivers a number of questions related to emotional well being in  		order to better understand and characterize the potential stress associated  		with providing care. We asked a number of general stress questions that were  		followed by a series of statements. The ICG could either agree or disagree with  		these statements.</p>
<p> First, we wanted to know in general, if providing help ever  		<i>"bothered"</i> the caregiver. More than half of the ICGs (58%) responded  		that it did. For this group, we then asked how much it bothered them. As shown  		in <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure14">Figure 14</a>, more than 75% said that helping bothered  		them a great deal or somewhat.</p>

</tr></table><p> Another general measure that we used to gauge stress was how often an  		ICG?s sleep was interrupted because of the care he or she provides. Over half  		(55%) stated that they do not sleep through the night as a result of providing  		care. If we only look at the instances where the caregiver and care-receiver  		are living with one another, 66% of caregivers say that their sleep is  		interrupted because of the care they provide. Even for those that do not  		co-reside, one-third report sleep interruption, primarily due to phone calls.  		Most often, formal help for claimants is provided during the day. However, a  		claimant's needs also occur during the night when formal caregivers are not  		likely to be present. Thus, in such instances, claimants turn to their ICG for  		help.</p>
<p> Next, we read a series of statements to the ICG and asked if they  		agreed or disagreed with each. This was done in order to determine specific  		areas of the caregiver's life that may be affected by care provision. These  		statements were designed to further classify the particular effects that  		providing care may have on the ICG. <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table4">Table 4</a> outlines the  		responses.</p>

Others have already observed that caregiving  		can be a significant risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms  		(Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Glaser, 1999). The responses above suggest that providing  		care has more of an emotional effect on caregivers than a physical effect. Only  		26% agreed that caring for a disabled loved one caused their health to get  		worse. When these responses were broken down by the severity of disability of  		the claimant, as measured by ADLs needing assistance, a pattern emerged (see  		<a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table5">Table 5</a>).</p>

</tr></table><p> ICGs caring for severely disabled claimants (i.e. those with five or  		six ADL limitations) were the most likely to experience one of the measures of  		stress. Conversely, respondents agreed less frequently with these statements  		about stress when they were caring for less disabled people.</p>
<p> A question that is interesting to relate to the stress questions is  		whether the ICG believes that the claimant can be left alone. This question was  		answered only for situations where the claimant lives with the ICG. As can be  		seen in <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure15">Figure 15</a>, there is a particularly close  		association between whether providing care is difficult emotionally and whether  		the claimant can be left alone. For those ICGs who believe that their care  		recipients cannot be left alone, 80% find the caregiving emotionally difficult  		and 63% feel bothered by it. This is felt most strongly by spouses.  		Ninety-three percent (93%) of spouses who feel that caregiving is emotionally  		difficult indicate that they cannot leave their partner alone.</p>

</tr></table><p> Overall providing informal care to privately insured community-based  		claimants seems to have a pervasive effect on most aspects of the caregiver's  		life -- employment as well as emotional health. Some caregivers also report  		declines in their own health status as a result of caregiving. This accords  		with recent research suggesting that being a caregiver who is experiencing  		mental or emotional strain is an independent risk factor for mortality,  		particularly among elderly spousal caregivers (Schulz &amp; Beach, 1999). Even  		though caregivers often relate that caring has had a significant effect on  		their lives, many of them also felt that it was their duty to care. When we  		asked this particular series of questions relating to emotional well being and  		the effects of caregiving, ICGs were quick to let us know that while they  		perceived that caring had adverse effects on them, they viewed it as their  		responsibility. Some caregivers were reluctant to answer the questions at times  		because they could not understand their importance. It was often difficult for  		them to separate their feelings of stress and responsibility from one another.  		</p>
<p> Lastly, we were interested in the effect that having private LTC  		insurance may have had on the overall stress level of ICGs. In theory, the  		presence of insurance-financed care could reduce or increase stress. An  		increase would result from the need to monitor formal caregivers or to interact  		with the insurer as well as with providers. Such is not the case. Only 4% of  		informal caregivers indicate that the presence of insurance actually increased  		stress levels. Another one-quarter of informal caregivers indicated that the  		insurance had no effect on their stress level. The most frequent response (68%)  		was that insurance benefits have reduced stress. It is also the case that ICGs  		caring for more disabled elders more frequently report stress.</p>

</tr></table><h3>D. Effects of Insurance on Caregiving</h3>
<p> We asked the ICGs a series of questions to determine what effect, if  		any, having a private LTC insurance policy had on the type and amount of care  		that they were providing to loved ones. Like the claimants themselves,  		caregivers are concerned about how LTC insurance benefits will affect and shape  		their caregiving role. In addition, the policy has major financial implications  		for many of the caregivers. If one were to ask who benefits most from the  		purchase of a LTC insurance policy, the answer would be split between those who  		benefit by an eased burden of care and those who benefit from the financial  		assistance. As shown previously, spousal ICGs are least likely to experience a  		change in employment status. Moreover, even in the presence of  		insurance-financed formal care, spousal ICGs continue to provide significant  		amounts of assistance with ADL limitations. Therefore, it is interesting to  		begin this section by addressing the question of whether the ICG has a role in  		the purchase of the LTC policy. All informal caregivers were asked whether or  		not they encouraged the claimant to purchase a LTC policy. <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure17">Figure 17</a> summarizes the results.</p>
<p> Only 20% of spousal ICGs did not encourage the purchase of the LTC  		policy. The other 80% either encouraged its purchase jointly, made the decision  		to purchase, or purchased the policy themselves. Children and other ICGs were  		least involved in the insurance purchase decision (or more precisely, did not  		encourage the purchase).</p>

</tr></table><p> We asked ICGs a variety of questions on their view of LTC insurance and  		on the effect of the specific policy on their behavior. Our discussion will  		focus first on the effect on caregiving and then on the ICG's perception of the  		policy. LTC insurance allows for the substitution of formal or paid care in  		place of informal or unpaid care. The ICG might respond to this situation by  		providing less care or by changing the nature of care provided. It is also  		possible that the need for care could change once the benefits of a policy  		commence, and that this could lead to a greater demand for care from all  		parties or sources, including the ICG. We asked caregivers whether the quantity  		of care they provide had changed following the commencement of benefits. More  		specifically, we inquired as to whether:</p>
<ol><li> they provide more, less or the same amount of care given that  		  insurance benefits are being paid to the claimant; and</li>
<li> in the absence of the claimant's policy would they now provide more,  		  less or the same amount of care as they currently provide.</li>
</ol><p> <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure18">Figure 18</a> shows that in the presence of  		insurance benefits; roughly two-in-three informal caregivers have not reduced  		the level of care that they provide. In fact, half of the caregivers have not  		changed the amount of care they provide at all. This finding suggests that for  		most informal caregivers, formal care does not simply substitute for or replace  		informal care. This was true across types of caregivers and across severity of  		disability. With that said, however, the picture is not crystal clear: about  		one-in-three did indicate that they now provide less informal care.</p>
<p> It is also noteworthy that 15% of informal caregivers suggested that  		they provide more informal care now that insurance benefits are being received  		and more formal care provided. This may reflect the fact that the situation of  		the claimant may have deteriorated since the onset of benefit payments so that  		the informal caregiver has had to increase the amount of care they provide. It  		may also be the case that the presence of insurance to finance formal care has  		enabled them to provide more care, but perhaps of a different nature, rather  		than less. This suggests that in some instances, formal care may be a  		complementary rather than substitute service for informal caregiving. It also  		implies that if disability had remained constant, the number of cases where  		ICGs provided less care as a consequence of insurance might have been  		larger.</p>

</tr></table><p> A closely related question posed to ICGs deals with whether more, less  		or the same amount of informal care would be provided by them to the claimant  		if there was not a policy to pay benefits. By focusing on behavior at a  		specific point in time, this question attempts to hold constant the level of  		disability in assessing the impact of LTC insurance. Among all caregivers, a  		slight majority (52%) indicated that if the policy was not paying benefits they  		would increase the level of informal care that they provide. Those ICGs who  		said they would provide more care were asked for an estimate of how much more  		care they would provide. The median number for those respondents was 20 hours  		per week.</p>
<p> One might wonder why so many more ICGs indicated that they would  		provide more care in the absence of the insurance policy (52%) than indicated  		that the amount of care they provide had fallen since benefits began (35%). The  		logical explanation is that the condition of the claimant had declined since  		before benefits were being paid. Thus, a continued decline is reasonable to  		presume. In the presence of insurance benefits, the level of informal  		caregiving needed to meet the increasing needs of the claimant may remain  		constant. Without insurance benefits, however, the level of caregiving would  		have had to increase.</p>
<p> Of the three possible responses, that of less care is least likely or  		expected. In fact, only about 5% of ICGs indicated that they would provide less  		care. One plausible explanation for the "less care" response is that without a  		LTC policy the disabled elder would have to seek some form of institutional  		care. In such a case, the ICG would provide less care. In fact, a number of  		ICGs who responded that they would provide less care also indicated that  		without the current LTC insurance policy, the claimant would have to find  		institutional care.</p>
<p> We asked informal caregivers whether the presence of insurance benefits  		has changed the nature or type of informal care that they provide. Most (71%)  		indicated that it had not. For those informal caregivers who indicated that  		they had changed the type of care that they provide, most show a reduction in  		ADL and IADL assistance and an increase in companionship services (see  		<a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure19">Figure 19</a>). Not shown in the figure is the fact that  		37% of the spousal ICGs spent "more time just being together" while over half  		(57%) of child ICGs spent more time just being together.</p>

</tr></table><p> A great deal of research has also focused on whether the use of formal  		home care services delays or prevents the use of costly institutional care like  		nursing home care (See Weissert, 1985; Weissert et al, 1989; Garber &amp;  		MaCurdy, 1989; Shapiro and Tate, 1989; Green et al, 1993; Wolf, 1997; Kane  		1998). Most of this research concludes that, unless very carefully targeted,  		home care rarely prevents someone from using nursing home care. Instead, there  		is a growing consensus that home care serves a distinct population that differs  		in relevant respects from the nursing home population. Yet, the decision to  		seek institutional care is a complicated one involving a myriad of factors,  		many of which cannot be adequately captured even by the most sophisticated  		multivariate modeling.</p>
<p>Because the impact of formal home care services on the use of costly  		institutional services is such an important issue, we decided to approach it  		from a somewhat different perspective. Rather than model the characteristics of  		individuals to determine potential overlap with the nursing home population, we  		focus on <b><i>potential service-seeking behaviors</i></b>. In other words, in  		our survey we asked the informal caregiver whether or not, in the absence of  		the insurance policy, the disabled claimant would be able to remain living at  		home. This provides an indication of whether or not, from the informal  		caregivers' perspective, the individual would be able to continue living  		independently in the community. <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#figure21">Figure 21</a> shows that  		among informal caregivers, almost half (46%) indicated that in the absence of  		the private insurance to pay for home care services, the elder would have to  		seek institutional alternatives.</p>

</tr></table><p> If one removes the fairly large number of "unsure" responses (16% of  		the total), spouses, children and other ICGs each responded "yes" more often  		than "no". Not shown in the figure is the fact that non-spousal caregivers,  		typically adult children, were the most likely to indicate that in the absence  		of policy benefits the claimant would need to seek institutional care -- 53% of  		non-spousal ICGs compared to 43% of spousal ICGs. It should be noted that we  		also looked at the association between responses to this question and the  		claimant's number of ADL limitations, the cognitive condition of the claimant,  		the health assessment of both the claimant and the ICG, and the income of the  		ICG. In none of these analyses was there a statistically significant  		relationship between these variables and the likelihood of responding that the  		care-receiver would need to seek institutional care.</p>
<h3>E. Comparing Informal Caregivers of Privately Insured  		and Non-Privately Insured Community-Dwelling Disabled Elders</h3>
<p>A primary purpose of the study of LTC insurance claimants was to compare  		privately insured disabled elders, most of whom receive benefits under their  		LTC policies, to disabled elders who do not have private insurance protection.  		We also wished to compare their informal caregivers along a number of  		dimensions. As mentioned previously, a common critique of comparative studies  		of informal caregiving and caregivers is that the definition of both formal and  		informal caregivers and caregiving is not held constant (Barer &amp; Johnson,  		1990; Stone, 1991). That is, because researchers employ different definitions  		of caregiving, one cannot be certain that the same phenomenon are being  		measured and compared. There have been few studies that have relied on  		consistently collected information using similar sampling bases and survey  		instruments.</p>
<p> Another common problem is that much of the caregiving literature  		attempts to understand the caregiver independent and often irrespective of the  		care-receiver. When trying to get an overall picture of caregiving, it is  		important not only to gather information about the caregiver, but to understand  		in detail the characteristics of the care-receiver as well. In this way, it is  		possible to gain a comprehensive picture of the caregiving population, the  		population of elders receiving informal care and how they effect and interact  		with each other. Finally, there is often a problem associated with the way in  		which caregivers are identified and selected for information gathering. Barer  		and Johnson (1990) report that many of the caregivers being studied are  		selected on the basis of their own identification as the primary informal  		support. Thus, not only do definitions vary, but also the self-selected nature  		of research samples makes it difficult to make generalizations to relevant  		populations.</p>
<p> This current study addresses these shortcomings by comparing  		information on the informal caregivers of insurance claimants with caregivers  		derived from the Informal Caregiver Supplements to the 1989 and 1994 National  		Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS).<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> In both of these surveys, the primary  		caregiver is defined and identified in exactly the same way. As is true in the  		claimant database, in the NLTCS, the ICG is determined from information  		provided by the disabled community-dwelling elder receiving help and  		assistance. Second, each survey collected comparable and detailed demographic,  		health and disability profile of the individuals who receive informal care  		(i.e. care-receivers), thus eliminating the potential bias created from  		self-selected samples. Lastly, identical questions were asked on the 1999  		Supplemental Informal Caregiver Survey of privately insured care-receivers and  		on the 1989 NLTCS Informal Caregiver Survey.</p>
<p> To assure an accurate comparison between the samples, we apply a  		minimum disability threshold and focus our analysis on a sub-set of informal  		caregivers.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> The  		sample inclusion criteria for disabled individuals in the 1989 NLTCS are more  		liberal than the inclusion criteria for the 1999 National Claimant Sample. To  		be included in the former, an individual had to be age 65 and over and only  		have one IADL limitation or be cognitively impaired. For the 1999 National  		Claimant Sample individuals had to be age 65 or older and, for the most part,  		have at least two ADL limitations or be cognitively impaired. To make the  		samples comparable, individuals in both samples had to be:</p>
<ol><li> disabled in at least two of six ADLs that require some level of  		  human assistance;<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note15">15</a></font></sup><b>or</b></li>
<li> cognitively impaired as measured by the Short Portable Mental Status  		  Questionnaire (SPMSQ);<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note16">16</a></font></sup><b>or</b></li>
<li> diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ol><p> Once these minimum disability selection criteria are applied, an  		accurate comparison of informal caregivers can be made. All subsequent  		comparative analyses of the informal caregivers of these two populations are  		based on sub-samples of disabled elders age 65 and over that reflect this  		underlying minimum disability threshold. In total, once these criteria are  		applied, the 1999 Supplemental Informal Caregiver Survey consists of 368  		caregivers and the 1989 NLTCS sample consists of 448 caregivers.</p>
<p><b><i>Demographic Characteristics</i></b></p>
<p><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table6">Table 6</a> highlights a number of the demographic  		characteristics of the informal caregivers of insured and non-insured disabled  		elders. As shown, on all socio-demographic dimensions, there are differences  		across the two samples of caregivers. Informal caregivers of the privately  		insured disabled tend to be older, more highly educated, and they are much  		wealthier than are their counterparts caring for the disabled without private  		insurance.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> Moreover,  		they are more likely to be married and are about four times more likely to be  		employed. This is somewhat surprising given the difference in average age  		between the two groups and the fact that greater proportions of caregivers for  		the privately insured are themselves spouses.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> Caregivers for these privately insured have  		been providing care for an average of about three years whereas caregivers of  		the non-privately insured have been giving such care for closer to five years.  		(Not shown in the table.)</p>
<p> Caregivers caring for disabled individuals without private insurance  		are more likely to live with them. There is also a greater likelihood that  		these caregivers are adult children, many of whom are unmarried. It may be that  		the presence of LTC insurance enables the privately insured to rely less on  		adult children for care. Previous research has shown that the desire to avoid  		having to rely on family and friends for care is a strong motivator for initial  		purchase (Cohen &amp; Kumar, 1996).</p>

<li> take time-off to provide informal care;</li>
<li> work fewer hours than they would have liked because they were  		  helping the disabled individual; or</li>

</tr></table><p> The relationship between insurance status, informal caregiving and  		employment is complicated. As shown, the caregivers of the privately insured  		are more likely to be employed than are those caring for the non-privately  		insured -- 35% compared to 9% (see <a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#table6">Table 6</a>). Moreover,  		they work more hours per week -- 33 compared to 21 -- and this may reflect a  		potential effect of their care-receiver having LTC insurance. Yet, among  		employed caregivers, those caring for the privately insured are also more  		likely to have to take time off without pay, to have to rearrange their work  		schedule to accommodate the care needs of the care-receiver, and have had to  		quit a job to continue to provide care.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> This may reflect the fact that ICGs caring  		for the privately insured are caring for more functionally disabled  		individuals. It may also be the case that because the caregivers of the  		privately insured work more hours on average, they are more likely to have to  		rearrange their schedule or take time off without pay. They may not have the  		same ability to meet the care needs of the disabled care-receiver and juggle  		their job when they are working so many hours per week. Hand-in-hand with this  		finding is the finding that caregivers of the non-privately insured are more  		likely to report that they have had to work fewer hours than they would have  		liked because of the help that they provide to the disabled care-receiver.</p>

</tr></table><p> With few exceptions, spousal caregivers are most likely to agree with  		these statements than are non-spousal caregivers. This is true across both  		samples. It is also true that caregivers of the privately insured are more  		likely to agree with these statements than are those caring for the  		non-privately insured. This may reflect the fact that there is a much greater  		proportion of working caregivers among the privately insured hence, the need to  		balance work and caregiving produces greater levels of stress. Also, the  		individuals that they are caring for are more disabled.<sup><font><a href="informal-caregivers-disabled-elders-long-term-care-insurance.html#note21">21</a></font></sup> Caregivers are least likely to agree with  		the statement that "...taking care of him/her has caused my health to get  		worse". Even so, among the non-privately insured, spousal caregivers are more  		likely to agree with this than are non-spousal caregivers. </p>
<p>The relationship of the caregiver to the care-receiver, the insurance  		status of the care-receiver, and the employment status of the caregiver affect  		the entire caregiving experience. The overall amount of care provided to  		disabled individuals across these two samples is similar. So too is the general  		reaction to the caregiving experience. Yet, there are important differences  		relating to the impact of caregiving on stress and employment. Such differences  		may be associated with many factors including the underlying health status of  		the disabled care-receiver as well as with the amount of time individuals have  		been caring for their disabled relative.</p>
<h2><a name="section5" id="section5">V. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</a></h2>
<p> In this study we have characterized informal caregivers and the  		caregiving experience of individuals with private LTC experience. When  		possible, we have made comparisons between caregivers caring for sub-samples of  		disabled privately and non-privately insured individuals. Perhaps one of the  		most important findings is that despite caring for very disabled elders, many  		caregivers of insured care-receivers are able to continue to work, especially  		adult children caregivers. While they may experience inconveniences (e.g.  		having to rearrange their schedule, missing days of care, and others) they have  		not had to drop out of the labor force completely. The fact that caregivers of  		the insured care-receivers were able to work so many hours increased the  		likelihood of such inconveniences. Of those non-spousal caregivers who were not  		working for pay, less than one-in-five indicated that they had to stop working  		to care for the disabled claimant. On the other hand, among adult children  		roughly two-in-five indicated that they would have continued working longer but  		for the care that they needed to provide to their disabled parent.</p>
<p> The differences in care provision and caregiving experience between  		spousal and non-spousal caregivers is stark. For the most part, spousal  		caregivers who care for the most disabled claimants provide more weekly hours  		of care, and provide much more hands-on assistance with basic ADLs. Even when  		the disability level of the care-receiver is held constant, spousal caregivers  		provide much more care than do non-spousal caregivers. Not surprisingly, they  		also experience greater emotional stress. They are more likely to agree that  		caregiving is hard on them emotionally, that they have to provide care even  		when they are not well, that it limits their social life, and that as a result  		of caregiving, their own health is worsening. To the extent that insurance  		plays a significant role in the caregiving experience, its effects seem to be  		greater for non-spousal caregivers, typically adult children.</p>
<p> Informal and formal caregiving appear to be complementary. In cases  		where the informal caregiver provides lower levels of informal care, formal  		care also is low. The converse is also true: when an informal caregiver is  		providing large amounts of care, so too is the formal caregiver. This  		observation supports early findings in this study that the presence of  		insurance-financed formal care does not significantly reduce caregiver effort.  		When asked, two-thirds of caregivers indicated that they had not reduced the  		amount of care they provide since insurance benefits commenced. This was true  		across caregiver type and across the severity of disability of the  		care-receiver.</p>
<p> Recent studies have suggested that caregiving can cause a deterioration  		in the health of the caregiver. Findings in this study support this  		proposition. Roughly one-quarter of caregivers indicated that their health had  		worsened as a result of their caregiving activities. This was true for both  		spousal and non-spousal caregivers as well as for caregivers providing care to  		privately insured disabled claimants. Clearly, there are health risks that go  		along with providing substantial amounts of care to disabled individuals. How  		to minimize such risks should be an important component of caregiver training  		and support.</p>
<p>There has been renewed interest in programs and insurance plans that  		make direct cash payments to disabled individuals so that they can use the  		money to purchase care from whomever they desire. One issue is whether informal  		caregivers would change the amount of care that they provide if they received  		monetary payment. Most caregivers indicated that the receipt of cash would not  		increase the level of care that they provide. Perhaps this is not surprising,  		given that over half of the caregivers were spouses. However, even among the  		non-spousal caregivers, only one-in-six indicated that a receipt of cash would  		lead them to increase the quantity of care they provide.</p>
<p> Not captured in this report are the individual experiences of  		caregivers themselves: how they cope on a daily basis with the challenge of  		caring for disabled relatives, how they try to balance caregiving with work and  		family life, and how they derive satisfaction from so doing. While these  		informal caregivers indicated that the presence of insurance does reduce their  		general level of stress they continue to experience daily difficulties even  		when significant amounts of formal care are provided. One of the more  		interesting qualitative findings was that many respondents just wanted to have  		the ability to talk to someone about their caregiving experience. They also  		indicated that they could use additional information about how to be better  		prepared to provide the necessary care and how to cope with the daily stresses  		associated with caregiving. The implication is that even when private insurance  		is available to finance significant amounts of care, ongoing support for  		informal caregivers is needed. Such support needs to address the emotional, and  		for some, the physical aspects associated with caregiving.</p>

<h2><a name="notes" id="notes">NOTES</a></h2>
<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">We</a> use the term non-privately insured to  			 highlight the fact that many elders have a form of public insurance in  			 Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">To</a> be included in the comparison sample, the  			 informal caregivers had to be caring for disabled elders that met a minimum  			 disability threshold of at least two of six ADL limitations or cognitive  			 impairment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">Virtually</a> every comment relating to care of the  			 elderly merits qualification. There have "always" been situations of  			 individuals being employed to provide special care for the aged, where the  			 family could afford such a luxury. It is only recently, though, that there has  			 been widespread formal care for the aged who live outside institutions. The  			 relationship between formal and informal care has been changing as formal care  			 becomes available, as its price changes, and as the social and economic demands  			 of informal caregivers change. LTC insurance is a new element that potentially  			 alters the relationship between informal caregivers, formal caregivers, and  			 those who receive the care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">There</a> are two aspects that are of particular  			 concern. The LTC insurance may induce behavior that is unlike that associated  			 with an uninsured disabled elder, and the individuals who are insured (and  			 their associated caregivers) may be different from the general population.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">It</a> is important to note that only in recent  			 years has the volume of home health care claims grown significantly. Few  			 carriers have garnered significant experience on home health care claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <a name="note6" id="note6">Important</a> exceptions to this general  			 observation are the 1989 and 1994 National Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS). In  			 these surveys, disabled elders aged 65 and over also identified the unpaid  			 person who helps them the most with everyday activities -- the primary informal  			 caregiver. For this reason, in a subsequent section, we have chosen the NLTCS  			 national samples as a basis for comparisons between insured and non-insured  			 disabled elders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <a name="note7" id="note7">See</a> "Who Buys Long-Term Care Insurance."  			 LifePlans Inc., 1995.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">Comparative</a> data is taken from the 1994 National  			 Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS). The NLTCS was designed to collect data about the  			 health and functional status of the Medicare beneficiary population over age  			 65. The questions were intended to identify persons who had certain  			 disabilities or health problems lasting three months or longer. These  			 individuals were also asked to identify their primary unpaid helper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">It</a> should be noted that the disabled group for  			 this sample was somewhat younger, thus increasing the likelihood that  			 caregivers of the group would also have younger children living with them.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">In</a> their survey of family caregiving in the  			 United States, NAC reported the average duration of care to be 4.5 years.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">The</a> substantial difference between the mean and  			 the median reveals the influence of outliers -- a relatively small number of  			 cases with very large number of hours of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">There</a> are a number of companies that are now  			 paying cash benefits to informal caregivers. Also, individuals with policies  			 that pay cash disability payments can use their benefits to pay informal  			 caregivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">Where</a> appropriate, we also use caregiver data  			 from the 1994 NLTCS.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">The</a> ADLs include bathing, dressing, toileting,  			 transferring, continence management, and feeding. A disability is present if an  			 individual requires stand-by, cueing, or hands-on assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note16" id="note16">Having</a> four or more errors on the SPMSQ.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note17" id="note17">Income</a> is not adjusted for changes in the cost  			 of living between 1989 and 1999.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">It</a> is important to note that these findings do  			 correspond to more recent data on informal caregivers derived from the 1994  			 NLTCS (HHS, 1999).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note19" id="note19">A</a> plausible explanation for this discrepancy is  			 that ICGs count companionship as part of their care hours whereas the  			 care-receiver may not do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note20" id="note20">These</a> comparative findings must be viewed with  			 caution given the relatively small number of caregivers from the 1989 NLTCS  			 sample that actually work.</p>
