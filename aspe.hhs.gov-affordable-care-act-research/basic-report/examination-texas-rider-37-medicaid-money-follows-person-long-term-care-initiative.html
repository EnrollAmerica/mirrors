<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Texas state legislature included a rider to the biennial budget in  		its 2002-2003 General Appropriations Act intended to promote choice,  		independence, and community integration for Medicaid-funded nursing facility  		residents who expressed a desire to live in the community. Rider 37, as this  		provision was generally known, allowed Medicaid funds that were being spent for  		a person in a nursing facility to be transferred to the states  		community-based care budget when the individual elected to return to the  		community. The initiative was re-authorized in the 2004-2005 budget as Rider 28  		and established in regulation in summer 2005 as the <i>Money Follows the  		Person</i> (MFP) funding policy. Unlike the Rider initiative, the MFP policy in  		its current form is now a full-fledged program with peripheral supports in  		place statewide, including relocation contractors, transition assistance funds,  		and interdisciplinary transition teams. </p>
<p>The Rider initiative in Texas is noted as an example that could serve as  		a model for other states with similar objectives. In this study, commissioned  		by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of  		the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we examine the experiences in  		the early years of the Rider initiative using information from site visits to  		four Texas communities in spring 2004 and analysis of Texas Medicaid long-term  		care data. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 10,156 people had moved to the  		community under the Rider initiative and the new MFP program.</p>
<p>Effectively, the Rider initiative provided an alternative eligibility  		route for the states various Medicaid community care programs. The  		largest Medicaid community care program in Texas, Community-Based Alternatives  		(CBA), serves older people and adults with physical disabilities who meet the  		criteria for nursing facility admission. It provides a comprehensive benefit  		package of long-term care services, including personal care services, nursing,  		minor home modifications, and therapies. All but a handful of Rider  		participants enter the CBA waiver program, so in this report we focus on that  		program. </p>
<h3>Study Objectives</h3>
<p>The research questions posed by ASPE fall into three broad areas: the  		transition process, participant characteristics, and service utilization and  		costs. The process issues studied include how the initiative works at the state  		and regional level, eligibility and enrollment processes, the scope of services  		and benefits, quality monitoring procedures, nursing facility participation in  		and reactions to the initiative, characteristics of Rider participants, as well  		as implementation issues and how they were resolved. </p>
<h3>Data and Methods</h3>
<p>The study included both a qualitative and a quantitative component. The  		qualitative component consisted of site visits to four counties in three Texas  		Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) service regions. Sites were  		chosen to reflect the diversity of regions and populations in Texas, and  		focused on areas with a large number of Rider transitions. Key informants  		included regional DADS officials and an array of provider and community  		stakeholders involved in assisting with or managing transitions under the  		Rider. Discussion topics included outreach and education about the Rider  		initiative for staff, nursing facility clients, and nursing facilities; the  		process to transition; procedures for monitoring clients after transition and  		assuring quality of services; administrative procedures and perceived burden;  		characteristics of participating clients and their facilities; service capacity  		in the community; and client satisfaction. </p>
<p>The quantitative component of the study used data from Texas Medicaid  		long-term care data files to explore how Medicaid recipients who opted to  		transition to the community through the Rider (Rider participants)  		compared to their non-Rider counterparts who remained in nursing facilities  		(nursing facility residents) or who received services through the  		CBA program (CBA clients). The Rider population studied consisted  		of 4,870 individuals who entered the CBA program directly after a nursing  		facility stay. The CBA population studied consisted of 15,895 non-Rider  		participants entering the CBA program beginning in September 2001 when the  		Rider took effect. The nursing facility resident sample consisted of 65,132  		residents who did not use the Rider and who had at least one Medicaid nursing  		facility payment in October 2003. We compared these groups on an array of  		demographics, medical diagnoses, and expected level of care dependence. Within  		each of the groups and across characteristics, we looked at service use,  		average monthly cost of services, and individual status after entry into the  		CBA program. We also report on the proportion of facilities with Rider  		transitions, the frequency of transitions, and characteristics of facilities  		with and without transitions. </p>
<p>Eligibility for the CBA program is restricted to adults ages 21 and  		over. As an extension, this analysis is limited to the same age group.  		Therefore, findings in this report and policy implications extending from it  		cannot be generalized to children. </p>
<h3>Findings: Overview</h3>
<blockquote><p><b>Texas initiated a MFP policy by authorizing the transfer of funds  		  from one Medicaid account to another under a rider to its general  		  appropriations bill. Program eligibility and procedures did not change, which  		  allowed this far-reaching change to be accomplished relatively smoothly.  		  </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Texass experience with the Rider 37/28 initiative demonstrates  		that a MFP component can be incorporated relatively easily into an existing  		Medicaid long-term care program. This far-reaching change in the states  		approach to long-term care was accomplished through the authorization of an  		accounting mechanism allowing funds to be shifted provisionally from the  		nursing facility component of the Medicaid budget to the community care  		component. In Texas, because community care programs were in place prior to  		this accounting change, the only change that the Rider made to the Medicaid  		long-term care program was, in effect, to identify the nursing facility  		population as a separate eligibility category for community care programs and  		to make this eligibility group exempt from any caps on enrollment in these  		programs. The comprehensive nature of the CBA benefits package allowed a  		diverse population of nursing facility residents to move back to residential  		settings that were more integrated in the community. In Texas, the accounting  		provisions embodied in Riders 37 and 28 later became one component in a  		comprehensive MFP funding policy, which defined a Medicaid long-term care  		program and incorporated lessons from the Rider initiative about the transition  		process.</p>
<h3>Findings: Process</h3>
<p class="Heading2"><b><i>Outreach</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>There is both formal and informal outreach to potential  		  participants in the Rider. An array of stakeholders notifies nursing home  		  residents about the Rider and identifies potential clients for transition to  		  the community.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all three regions where site visits took place, DADS staff  		caseworkers and social workers at nursing facilities serve key roles in  		identifying clients who are interested in or suitable for transition to the  		community. Local ombudsmen and advocates for the elderly and disabled are an  		important additional source of information; in some regions, they advocate for  		and assist residents transitions. As the initiative has matured, word of  		mouth has become a source of information for potential clients. </p>
<p><b><i>Steps to a Transition </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Steps to a transition include determining eligibility, developing a  		  service plan, and contracting for services in the community prior to the  		  nursing home residents discharge. Eligibility for community programs is  		  determined while the participant is still in the nursing facility, which  		  minimizes gaps in services.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individuals who are interested in leaving the nursing facility are  		assigned a DADS caseworker and work with a home health agency to develop an  		Individual Service Plan (ISP). The residents choice of agencies and input  		into the ISP is his or her chief opportunity to influence the care plan, as  		Texas waiver programs do not currently include provisions for consumer  		direction. The DADS caseworker then arranges for all of the necessary  		components of the plan to be put in place by the time the client leaves the  		nursing facility. Eligibility and service coordination tasks are conducted  		while the client resides in the nursing facility. DADS staff generally felt  		that the presence of informal supports greatly facilitated the transition  		process, but that clients without informal supports were able to transition.  		Estimates of the time from identification of an eligible resident to the day he  		or she moved back to the community ranged from one to two months up to as long  		as four to five months. </p>
<p><b><i>Issues Affecting a Smooth Transition to the Community </i></b></p>
<p>Informants identified three primary issues affecting a smooth transition  		to the community. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Payment for community-based services cannot be made prior to a  		  clients discharge from the nursing facility, which sometimes complicates  		  the coordination of services needed in place by the clients first day in  		  the community. </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An overarching issue affecting smooth transition to the community arises  		from the fact that the Rider is, in effect, an accounting mechanism that  		transfers funds from one program budget to another. Clients cannot receive  		services from a nursing facility and a community care program at the same time,  		but in order for a participants home to be made ready, home modifications  		need to be complete and adaptive aids and other supports in place when the  		client arrives. Changes had to be made in state policy to allow work such as  		home modifications to be contracted before the client leaves the nursing  		facility, even though payment for these contracts cannot be made until the  		clients first day in the community. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Respondents reported that the most difficult challenges to  		  implementing transitions were finding suitable housing, identifying accessible  		  transportation, and finding a physician in the community.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most difficult challenges reported by site visit informants related  		to components of community care that are beyond the scope of the CBA program  		itself. Difficulty finding acceptable housing was identified as a pervasive  		problem that often delayed transition. The lack of accessible transportation in  		areas where housing was most affordable was problematic for placing  		participants. Finding a physician in the community was reported to be most  		difficult for long-term nursing facility residents or those new to the  		community, since these clients were least likely to have existing ties to local  		providers. </p>
<p>Some challenges, such as accessing transportation, are more acute in  		rural areas, and others, such as the risk of social isolation and finding  		physician services, are not specific to Rider participants or the CBA program.  		In general, community capacity for the provision of services to nursing  		facility residents moving back to the community likely contributes to some of  		the differences across regions in service use and in the number of transitions  		observed in this study.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Respondents reported finding reliable contractors for minor home  		  modifications and maintaining quality personal attendant services as the most  		  frequent challenges to a smooth transition.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certain services presented challenges in implementation. DADS  		caseworkers and home health agency representatives reported that finding  		reliable contractors for minor home modifications were the biggest challenges.  		In addition, a large majority of Rider participants rely on personal attendant  		services, and these services are a repeated source of problems due to no-shows  		and high turnover rates among personnel. These problems are not limited to the  		CBA program and not attributable to the Rider, but need to be resolved if the  		program is to function smoothly. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Facility Response to the Rider Initiative</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Facility participation is widespread. Transition volume at most  		  facilities is low.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facility participation in the initiative is widespread with transitions  		occurring in all regions and in both rural and urban areas, and in many  		different types of facilities. Transition volume at most facilities is fairly  		low. Over the three-year study period, a little more than one-third of  		participating facilities had only one or two transitions, while just under  		one-third had three to five transitions. The remaining third represented a  		range of Rider activity, including a few high volume facilities. </p>
<p>This study suggests that although the Rider is significant for  		individual participants, it is generally not a significant issue for nursing  		facilities generally. The total number of transitions across the state is small  		relative to the size of the nursing facility population, and the number from  		most individual facilities is small. Thus, the direct impact of the Rider  		initiative on nursing facility occupancy and the larger market for long-term  		care services, at the time of this study, was small. With the advent of a  		comprehensive MFP program in 2005 in Texas, the effect on nursing facilities  		can be expected to increase. The pace of transitions suggests that the changes  		will be incremental in nature, allowing the nursing facility market to adjust  		over time.</p>
<p><b><i>Quality Monitoring </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Quality monitoring under the Rider initiative occurs through the  		  community-based program in which they participate.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formal quality monitoring under the Rider follows the procedures in  		place for the waiver programs that the Rider participants enter. Under the CBA,  		the ISP is reviewed by the caseworker quarterly for appropriateness. DADS is  		responsible for monitoring the home health agencies, which are, in turn,  		responsible for monitoring the quality of care provided by their employees.  		Non-DADS personnel, such as the ombudsman and Meals-on-Wheels volunteers, also  		assist in quality monitoring, either formally or informally. Day-to-day quality  		issues are handled through standard DADS complaint procedures, which allow a  		client to contact their DADS caseworker to report problems. Some advocates and  		nursing facility personnel expressed discomfort at the lower level of  		regulation and supervision of assisted living facilities, where a large  		minority of Rider participants live, compared with nursing facilities or home  		health agencies. </p>
<h3>Findings: Rider Participants and Comparison Groups</h3>
<p><b><i>Characteristics of Rider Participants</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Although Rider participants represent a wide range of nursing  		  facility residents, certain characteristics are associated with a greater  		  likelihood of transition to the community under the Rider.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rider participants represent a wide range of nursing facility residents  		in all regions of the state and in both rural and urban areas as well as a wide  		range of types of disabilities and medical conditions. This breadth of  		participation suggests that the program has provided opportunities to return to  		the community for most types of clients.</p>
<p>Rider participants are predominantly elderly and female, reflecting the  		characteristics of nursing facility residents in general. Hispanics are  		slightly over-represented in the Rider population, while non-Hispanic Blacks  		are slightly under-represented as compared to the general nursing facility  		population. The average length of stay in the nursing facility prior to  		transition is over seven months, and more than one-third of Rider participants  		statewide have resided in the facility for six months or more. About one-third  		of Rider participants are classified as clinically stable with the highest  		level of functioning and lowest number of limitations in activities of daily  		living allowed under nursing facility Medicaid eligibility requirements.  		However, even those needing the most medical resources, such as individuals  		with quadriplegia or in a coma, are represented among participants. </p>
<p>Younger residents and those in urban counties are more likely to use the  		Rider than older residents and those residing in rural counties. Those with the  		lowest care dependence are somewhat over-represented among Rider participants  		relative to the nursing facility population. The percentage of older Rider  		participants with diagnosed dementia is far lower compared to nursing facility  		residents. A higher proportion of Rider participants have a diagnoses of stroke  		compared to nursing facility residents. </p>
<p><b><i>Participant Status After Entry into the CBA Program</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Participation in the CBA program is relatively stable among Rider  		  participants. Over 70 percent are still receiving CBA services twelve months  		  after entry into the program.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over 80 percent of recipients in both the Rider and CBA populations  		remained in the CBA program in the sixth month after entry into CBA, though  		slightly fewer Rider participants than CBA clients were still in the program.  		The proportion remaining on CBA declines over time; nonetheless, 71 percent of  		Rider participants and 85 percent of CBA clients were still receiving CBA  		services through the twelfth month, which suggests that the CBA population  		overall is relatively stable. With a few exceptions and with consideration for  		omissions in the data, we found that the CBA program appears to be able to  		provide the opportunity for community living for a very wide range of  		recipients through the Rider, including those with mental health or behavioral  		issues and those requiring heavy care. Due to data limitations, no conclusions  		about hospitalization or mortality rates can be drawn from this study.</p>
<p>Overall, site visit informants evinced enthusiasm for the initiative.  		However, some informants noted that not all populations are equally well  		served. Informants identified clients with severe and persistent mental  		illness, clients with Alzheimers disease, and high-needs clients with  		physical disabilities as more difficult to transition. Respondents noted  		particularly that the lack of community systems to properly manage complex  		medication regimens for the severely mentally ill could be a precursor to  		return to a nursing facility for some participants. </p>
<p><b><i>Service Use </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>About one-third of Rider participants enter assisted living  		  facilities (ALFs), which affect overall patterns of service use. Assisted  		  living use varies widely across regions and participants level of care  		  dependence.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>About one-third of Rider participants enter ALFs, a rate five times  		higher than CBA clients. ALF use is twice as common in urban areas as in rural  		areas for Rider participants. Use of ALFs also varies by expected level of care  		need. About half of those with the lowest expected level of care needs are  		living in ALFs compared to 2 percent of those needing the highest level of care  		need. The share of both Rider participants and CBA clients with a nursing  		facility stay over the six-month period after CBA entry was low, regardless of  		assisted living facility use.</p>
<p>The difference in use of assisted living drives other observed  		differences in service use since the services included in the assisted package  		are not reimbursed separately. When service use is analyzed separately by  		assisted living status, there are few differences between the Rider and CBA  		groups in the proportion receiving each service.</p>
<p><b><i>Program Expenditures </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Rider participants incurred costs in the CBA program that were  		  about 10 percent higher than for non-Rider CBA clients, a difference driven in  		  part by higher use of assisted living but also higher average costs for  		  personal attendant services among those who did not use assisted living.  		  </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite differences in service mix between Rider participants and CBA  		clients, total average monthly program expenditures for all services appear to  		differ by about 10 percent--or $100 per client per month--with total  		expenditures of $1,143 per client per month for the Rider population compared  		with $1,043 for the CBA population. Analysis reveals higher average program  		expenditures for Rider participants across almost all subgroups, suggesting  		that no subgroup of Rider participants accounts for the observed difference.  		The difference in expenditures appears to be driven only in part by differences  		in the use of assisted living. The total average monthly program expenditures  		for ALF residents are higher than for non-ALF residents for both Rider  		participants and CBA clients, but a greater share of Rider participants enter  		assisted living. For recipients who do not use assisted living, Rider  		participants have a higher average cost for personal attendant services. In  		general, assisted living appears to be a nearly cost-neutral substitute for  		other CBA services.</p>

<h3>Overview of Rider 37</h3>
<p>In part as a response to the 1999 <i>Olmstead v L.C.</i> decision, the  		Texas state legislature included a rider to the biennial budget in its  		2002-2003 General Appropriations Act intended to promote choice, independence,  		and community integration for Medicaid-funded nursing facility residents who  		expressed a desire to live in the community. Rider 37, as this provision was  		generally known, allowed Medicaid funds from the states nursing facility  		budget to be transferred to the community-based care budget when an individual  		elects to make a transition to the community.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> Any interested Medicaid nursing facility  		resident who met medical and functional eligibility criteria for one of the  		states community care programs was eligible, regardless of his or her  		length of stay in the facility under Medicaid. The inclusion of Rider 37 in the  		appropriations act provided a quick and efficient way for the state to add a  		money follows the person component to its Medicaid long-term care  		program. It did not require major restructuring of the Medicaid long-term care  		program, and officials expected it to be, at a minimum, budget-neutral. The  		Rider took effect in September 2001.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As a rider rather than as regulation or a legislated program, this  		initiative was limited to the period covered by the biennial budget. In the  		next General Appropriations Act, the legislature included nursing facility  		transition language to the 2004-2005 biennial budget, this time as Rider 28.  		Experience with the initiative up to that time led to some modifications, which  		were incorporated in the Rider 28 language and the additional Riders 7b and  		37.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> The modifications  		under Rider 7b loosened restrictions on the cost of services for an individual,  		allowing additional community services for current waiver clients up to  		133% of the reimbursement rate that would have been paid for the same  		individual to receive comparable services in an institution over a six-month  		period.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> State  		officials report that, in practice, this restriction means that expenditures  		are capped at 133 percent of expenditures over the calculated service plan  		during a six-month timeframe, but that there is no direct relationship to costs  		incurred in the nursing facility.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note5">5</a></font></sup> More significantly, the language of the new  		Rider 37 mandated that Rider 28 transitions to the community not increase the  		base number of appropriated community care waiver slots, so that once a  		transition client left the waiver program their waiver slot expired. Thus, the  		initiative was modified so that nursing facility transitions under the Rider  		would result in only a temporary expansion of the number of slots available  		under the various community-based service programs. </p>
<p>These riders (28, 7b, and the new 37) remained in effect through August  		2005. In 2005, the 79<sup>th</sup> Legislative Session enrolled, and the  		Governor signed into law, House bill 1867 codifying Rider 28 as the <i>Money  		Follows the Person</i> (MFP) funding policy. The MFP policy incorporates many  		peripheral supports statewide, including relocation contractors, transition  		assistance funds, and interdisciplinary transition teams. In this report, we  		refer to Texas MFP policy as the Rider initiative in order to  		distinguish the early period of implementation under Riders 37 and 28, the  		period of our study, from the more recent period under the 2005 MFP funding  		policy.</p>
<p>The Rider<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note6">6</a></font></sup> states  		that it is the intent of the legislature that as clients relocate from  		nursing facilities to community care services funds will be transferred from  		Nursing Facilities to Community Care Services to cover the cost of the shift in  		services.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note7">7</a></font></sup>  		Reconciliation of the states long-term care budget takes place annually,  		and any unspent dollars for Rider participants under Community Care Services  		are transferred back to the Nursing Facilities fund. </p>
<p>Due to high demand for services, most of the Community Care programs  		maintain a list of state residents, called interest lists, who have expressed  		interest in participating in a program but for whom there are no available  		program slots.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note8">8</a></font></sup> The  		largest waiver program in Texas, Community-Based Alternatives (CBA), serves  		older people and adults (age 21 and over) with physical disabilities who meet  		the criteria for nursing facility admission. It provides a comprehensive  		benefit package of long-term care services, including personal care services,  		nursing, minor home modifications, and therapies. As of March 2004, the program  		had a monthly average enrollment of 30,000 clients in FY 2003 and an estimated  		64,000 people on the interest list.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note9">9</a></font></sup> In comparison, by the end of February 2005,  		nearly 8,000 people had moved to the community under Riders 37 and  		28.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Study Objectives</h3>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has an interest in better  		understanding alternative Medicaid financing models such as the Texas Rider  		initiative. Beginning in FY 2004 and in every budget since then, the Centers  		for Medicare and Medicaid Services included a five-year, $1.75 billion  		demonstration project, the <i>Money Follows the Individual  		Rebalancing Initiative</i>, to assist states in developing and implementing  		strategies to rebalance their Medicaid long-term care programs to  		incorporate a cost-effective mix of institutional and community options for  		care. The stated goal of the Rebalancing Initiative is ...to create a  		more equitable balance between institutional and community-based services  		spending; to increase the responsiveness and cost-effectiveness of the system;  		assist states to fulfill the Americans with Disabilities Act; and increase the  		amount of control individuals with disabilities are able to exert over service  		choices.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note11">11</a></font></sup> The  		Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 includes funding for state MFP demonstration  		projects. The Rider initiative in Texas is noted as an example of a unique  		state experience that could serve as a model for other states with similar  		objectives.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p>ASPE commissioned this study of the Texas Rider initiative to learn  		about the early experience of the program and to help illuminate the strengths  		and limitations of the approach Texas has taken to implementing a MFP approach  		in serving a complex population.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> As part of this study, the Urban Institute  		undertook field research to better understand how the initiative works in  		varied settings in the state. This research was reported in an interim report  		to ASPE.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note14">14</a></font></sup> A second  		interim report summarized findings from the Urban Institutes analysis of  		data provided by the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services  		(DADS)<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note15">15</a></font></sup>, a state  		agency overseen by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The research questions posed by ASPE fall into five broad  		areas:<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>

</ul><p>The next section of this report provides a brief overview of our  		research methods for both the field research and the quantitative analyses,  		including a brief description of the limitations of each of these  		analyses.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note18">18</a></font></sup> We then  		present findings and observations from our qualitative study and quantitative  		analyses relevant to specific research questions. We conclude with a summary of  		our findings.</p>
<h3>Data and Methods</h3>
<p>The qualitative component of the research was based on key informant  		interviews at four sites in three DADS regions across the state during April  		and May 2004. Our selection criteria included counties with a high number of  		transitions, geographic spread across the state, and diversity in regional  		populations based on ethnicity and income. We included one predominantly rural  		county in order to look at potential differences in process between rural and  		urban areas. Based on these criteria, we chose to visit Ft. Worth in Region 3  		(Tarrant County, north-central Texas), McAllen in Region 11 (Hidalgo County, on  		the Texas-Mexico border near the Gulf coast), and Abilene and the nearby rural  		town, Brownwood, in Region 2 (Taylor County and Brown County, west-central  		Texas).<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Discussions with key informants at each site were scheduled in advance  		of our visits. We met with regional DADS officials (caseworkers, supervisors,  		Medicaid eligibility staff, and quality control staff), nursing facility  		administrators, home health and other community providers, the long-term care  		ombudsman, representatives from the Area Agency on Aging, and local advocacy  		groups. For each category of key informant with whom we met, we developed a  		standard discussion guide.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note20">20</a></font></sup> All informants were promised anonymity to  		encourage them to express their thoughts freely. </p>
<p>In the quantitative analysis, we used data from Texas Medicaid long-term  		care data files to explore how Medicaid recipients who opted to transition to  		the community through the Rider (Rider participants) compared to  		their non-Rider counterparts who remained in nursing facilities (nursing  		facility residents) or who were already receiving services through the  		CBA program (CBA clients).<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note21">21</a></font></sup> The Rider population included 4,870  		individuals, the nursing facility resident sample included 65,132 individuals,  		and the CBA sample included 15,895 individuals. Because there are only a small  		number of Rider participants under the age of 21 and because only adults are  		eligible for the CBA program, we limited our analysis to recipients who were  		age 21 and older. (More detailed methodology is provided as an  		<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#append1">appendix</a>.)</p>
<p><b><i>Study Limitations</i></b></p>
<p>For the qualitative analysis, we intentionally chose sites where there  		had been large numbers of transitions from nursing facilities to community  		settings so that we could investigate how the Rider works on the ground and  		what had been the experiences of clients who had completed the transition  		process. However, it is likely that we would have learned a different story had  		we visited places where there had been few transitions. We might have learned,  		for example, what constitutes an absolute barrier to Rider implementation, such  		as resistance to transitions among local nursing facilities or inadequate  		capacity in the community for providing services to transitioned clients. </p>
<p>The quantitative analysis is limited in that the Texas Medicaid  		long-term care databases are designed to meet operational rather than research  		needs. Omission of data on hospitalizations and incomplete information on  		mortality limit the picture we could assemble on the status of clients who  		leave the nursing facility for the community. Our analysis is limited to adults  		age 21 and over. While all nursing facility residents are eligible to use the  		Rider irrespective of age at the time of our study, few children and  		adolescents actually had transitioned from nursing facilities using the Rider,  		as noted above. Therefore, our examination of the Rider and policy implications  		extending from it are not generalizeable to children. Additional limitations  		imposed by the data are noted where relevant to specific analyses.</p>
<h2><a name="findings" id="findings">FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>Components of the Rider 37 Initiative</h3>
<p>The Rider does not define a program, but rather it opens another path to  		eligibility for existing Medicaid community care waiver programs. Site visit  		informants saw the new eligibility pathway as important because of the long  		interest list for most of these waiver programs. All expressed enthusiasm for  		the Rider initiative although most had suggestions for how to make it work  		better. </p>
<p>At its simplest, the Rider is an accounting mechanism, allowing the  		transfer of funds from one part of the Medicaid long-term care budget--nursing  		facility care--to another--community-based care. It builds on existing  		community care waiver programs, so its implementation is influenced by how  		these existing programs are functioning. All but a handful of Rider  		participants enter the CBA waiver program.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>How the community care programs function in different areas of the state  		is influenced by community characteristics and local market characteristics. In  		addition, DADS regions have been allowed a fair amount of flexibility in how  		they implement the initiative so that the regional or local administrative  		structure and its working relationships with providers and advocates are also  		important. Therefore, we consider local socio-demographics, provider capacity,  		and regional implementation decisions in looking at how the Rider functions in  		a given community. </p>
<p>In this section, we describe the general procedures that are used under  		the Rider to move nursing facility residents to the community. We look at  		eligibility and outreach practices, the transition process, the role of  		relocation contractors, the services and benefits covered under the CBA  		program, and procedures in place for quality monitoring. Finally, we consider  		how this process differs for different types of clients and in rural versus  		urban areas. </p>
<p><b><i>Outreach and Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>When the initiative was new, state and regional DADS officials took  		steps to inform nursing facilities and nursing facility residents about the  		program through various forms of outreach. The formal procedures for informing  		providers and clients included letters to individual nursing facilities  		outlining the new initiative and the associated procedures. Residents of  		nursing facilities in many regions also received a letter describing the  		initiative although, in some regions, such letters were not sent for fear that  		the resulting number of people seeking to leave nursing facilities would  		outstrip the regions ability to arrange transitions. In some regions,  		information about the program is included now in the Medicaid eligibility  		letter given to nursing facility clients. DADS staff reported that they had not  		received special training related to the Rider but that information about the  		initiative was included in their ongoing training.</p>
<p>In the three regions where site visits took place, DADS staff  		caseworkers and social workers at nursing facilities were reported to play an  		important role educating nursing facility residents about the initiative. Other  		organizations and personnel, such as ombudsmen and advocates for the elderly  		and for people with disabilities are an important additional source of  		information. In some regions, nursing facilities include a description of the  		Rider as part of discharge planning for residents at admission to the nursing  		facility. Over time, word of mouth has become an increasingly important source  		of information about the initiative for nursing facility residents and other  		possibly interested clients. No formal efforts are made to inform people on the  		interest list about the initiative but site visit informants reported that word  		of mouth has been effective in reaching this population.</p>
<p>Eligibility for entrance into community care programs under the terms of  		the Rider is limited to nursing facility residents who are eligible for  		Medicaid. For those potential Rider clients who have not been found Medicaid  		eligible already, there is a 45-day time limit within which the state must  		complete its Medicaid eligibility determination. If a nursing facility resident  		has already been deemed Medicaid eligible before applying for the waiver  		program, the process could be shorter than 30 days depending on the amount of  		time required to complete all arrangements for transition. Medical eligibility  		for Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing facilities is assessed every six months  		for the first two years of nursing facility care, but after two years,  		eligibility is assumed. In contrast, DADS reassesses medical and financial  		eligibility of Rider participants once a year for the duration of  		participation.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Steps to Transition </i></b></p>
<p>The first step in transition to the community is the identification and  		referral to DADS of people who meet the eligibility criteria and are interested  		in leaving the nursing facility. Nursing facility social workers and local  		ombudsmen are frequent sources of referrals to DADS for the Rider. Medicaid  		eligibility workers, who provide residents with information about Medicaid,  		including the Rider, are another source. </p>
<p>Once a resident has been identified as a potential candidate for the  		Rider, he or she is assessed for medical and financial eligibility for Medicaid  		and, if eligible, assigned a DADS caseworker. The caseworker gives the resident  		a list of participating home health agencies from which to choose and  		facilitates a meeting between the resident and the chosen agency. The home  		health agency must meet with the resident within 14 days to assess his or her  		needs and to develop an Individual Service Plan (ISP). The DADS caseworker  		arranges for all of the necessary components of the established ISP to be put  		in place by the time the client leaves the nursing facility. In addition to  		waiver program services, clients could apply for a one-time Transition to Life  		in the Community (TLC) grant of up to $2,500 for costs related to transition  		such as rental deposits, deposits on utility services, or basic kitchen  		supplies. </p>
<p>The state also has contracts with relocation specialists to assist in  		the transition process. The relocation specialist contracts began a one-year  		pilot project in May 2002 in selected areas of the state and were extended  		through November 2003. After that time, the contracts were expanded statewide.  		The relocation contractors were charged with outreach to potential transition  		clients and with assisting with the relocation of a specified number of  		clients. In addition, they coordinated the TLC grants. In September 2004,  		reimbursement for such costs was moved to the Medicaid waiver programs as  		Transition Assistance Services. </p>
<p>The residents choice of agencies and input into the ISP is his or  		her chief opportunity to influence the care plan. The waiver programs do not  		currently include provisions for consumer direction, such as a choice of  		workers or the employment of friends or family members as personal  		attendants.</p>
<p>There was a broad range of opinions among site visit informants on the  		role of family or other informal supports in the transition process. Home  		health agencies take into account informal supports in designing the ISP and  		noted that a client without informal supports would likely require a greater  		number of service hours and possibly more intensive care. Advocates contend  		that lack of family supports should not be a barrier to transition, that the  		waiver program should provide whatever hours are necessary and not penalize  		people without family. DADS staff generally felt that the presence of informal  		supports greatly facilitated the transition process. </p>
<p>Site visit informants said that the time from identification of an  		eligible resident to that residents transition day varied depending on  		the services needed, where the person was moving to, and the availability of  		informal supports such as family or friends to assist in the process. Estimates  		made by informants ranged from one to two months up to as long as four to five  		months. </p>
<p><b><i>Types of Clients Served</i></b></p>
<p>Rider participants represent a wide range of nursing facility residents  		in all regions of the state and in both rural and urban areas. State and  		regional staff, the advocacy community, and the relocation contractors all  		evinced great enthusiasm for the initiative and a commitment to meeting the  		needs of all clients. The ability of the initiative to assist in meeting the  		needs of a range of clients in many different settings is one of its strengths.  		</p>
<p>Site visit informants, nonetheless, reported that the Rider initiative  		and the associated community-based services do not serve all populations  		equally well. They noted that serving clients with severe and persistent mental  		illness or with Alzheimers disease has proved difficult. In the former,  		medication management has been an issue; in the latter, the perceived  		difficulty has derived from the changes in client behavior that often occur  		over the course of the illness. </p>
<p>Respondents also noted that some high-needs clients with physical  		disabilities can face difficulties in getting their needs met in the community  		on a long-term basis, and the procedures have been revised to address this  		issue. For example, once a client has chosen a home health agency, the agency  		cannot refuse to assess that client. The agency does, however, have the right  		to refuse to take someone on as a client if they are not certain of their  		ability to meet the clients needs. In that case, the client must choose  		another agency. The agencys right of refusal is a modification of  		original procedures, in response to agency assertions that the requirement to  		serve any client that chose them could lead them to accept clients whose needs  		they were ill-prepared to meet and with possibly serious implications for  		quality of care. Advocates, on the other hand, contend that loosening this  		requirement has made it harder for residents with higher intensity needs, such  		as quadriplegics or those who are ventilator-dependent, to find an agency to  		take them on as a client, skewing program participation toward those with lower  		care needs and setting up a barrier to transition for high-needs clients. </p>
<p>As will be seen in the discussion below of the medical conditions of  		Rider participants, people with a wide range of types of disabilities are being  		served through the Rider initiative. Therefore, it appears that the problem of  		differential access, if it exists, does not systematically eliminate  		opportunities to live in the community for the most severely disabled and  		mentally ill, but can create additional challenges. Nonetheless, differential  		access by different populations is an area that warrants monitoring so that if  		systematic difficulties are found steps can be taken to address the identified  		barriers to access. </p>
<p>At the time of this study, the Rider initiative had been in effect for  		about three years, so the long-term capacity for the initiative to support  		community-based living of high-needs populations has yet to be determined. As  		public support for community-based options increases, the market for long-term  		care services can be expected to respond through expansion and diversification  		of services to better serve all clients. The fact that the initiative has now  		moved from temporary status as a rider to full integration into the Medicaid  		program may serve to reduce market uncertainty about responding to the growing  		demand for community-based services. </p>
<p><b><i>Role of Relocation Contractors </i></b></p>
<p>In 2003, the state undertook a one-year pilot project to provide  		relocation services and increase community awareness of community-based care  		alternatives to nursing facility care in 33 counties. DADS expanded the  		relocation contracts statewide near the end of the study period, in spring  		2004, which could ameliorate some identified access problems. Early in the  		contracts, there was some confusion about the role of the contractors. For  		example, in McAllen, DADS regional staff members were not widely aware of the  		existence of the relocation contract as part of the Rider initiative. However,  		when the contractor was mentioned by name, staff members were quick to say that  		they had worked with the contractor, particularly when they needed help with  		difficult cases, but under other, non-state funding. </p>
<p>Many of the relocation contractors have been working with people with  		disabilities under other, non-Rider funding and have substantial experience in  		promoting independent living for this population. Our discussions with local  		DADS staff and the relocation contractors left us with the impression that  		there had been an implicit division of tasks by type of client, with DADS  		working with elderly residents and the relocation contractors continuing their  		work with the younger disabled population. Thus, at the time of this study, the  		contractors appeared to be filling a niche within the system rather than the  		broader role envisioned in the pilot program. Nevertheless, the division of  		responsibilities seemed to be working well and the contractors role has  		the potential to evolve as they gain experience with the elderly population.  		DADS also has non-formal contacts with other private organizations,  		particularly advocacy groups, such as the Centers for Independent Living,  		United Cerebral Palsy, and the Mental Health Association, whose missions  		include monitoring access to services for their clients and so overlap to a  		certain extent with the goals of the Rider initiative. </p>
<p>There are limitations to what the relocation contracts can realistically  		be expected to achieve. In particular, site visit respondents feared that the  		small number of contractors spread across the state would limit their impact.  		The contractor serving McAllen was located in the next town, about 20 minutes  		away, making interaction with DADS regional staff easy. In contrast, in Abilene  		and Brownwood, advocates expressed doubts that a relocation contractor assigned  		to the entire region and based in Lubbock nearly 250 miles away would have much  		of an impact in rural areas. According to informants, a relocation specialist  		with such a large area to cover would have a difficult time making the  		necessary connections locally and identifying the necessary resources in all of  		the various rural areas to function effectively. </p>
<p><b><i>Covered Services and Other Benefits </i></b></p>
<p>Rider participants are entitled to the benefits that all Medicaid  		beneficiaries may receive (i.e., acute care, nursing facility care, and  		hospitalization). In addition, Rider participants are entitled to all  		authorized services covered under the community-based care program that they  		enter. In the case of the CBA program, the ISP sets the authorized level of  		services such as the number of hours of personal care attendant services,  		nursing services, specific therapies,<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note24">24</a></font></sup> adaptive aids, and medical supplies. The ISP  		may also authorize minor home modifications, such as the widening of doors and  		installation of ramps to accommodate a wheelchair, and adaptive aids or durable  		medical equipment (DME), such as a hospital bed, to ensure their safety and  		independence in the community. Rider participants who enter the CBA program may  		also be authorized to receive adult foster care, respite care, and services in  		assisted living facilities (ALFs). At the time of our study, all Rider  		participants were entitled to an unlimited number of prescribed drugs. Since  		the implementation of Medicare Part D in January 2006, participants in the CBA  		program who are eligible for Medicare receive drug coverage through that  		program. </p>
<p><b><i>Issues Affecting a Smooth Transition to the Community </i></b></p>
<p>Moving someone who requires nursing facility level care from one setting  		to another involves the coordination of a large number of people, equipment,  		and supplies. It is, therefore, not surprising that informants identified  		issues, large and small, affecting a smooth transition to the community. An  		overarching issue arises from the fact that the Rider is an accounting  		mechanism that transfers funds from one program budget to another. Clients  		cannot receive services from a nursing facility and a community care program at  		the same time, but in order for a participants home to be ready for him  		or her to move into after leaving the nursing facility, home modifications need  		to be complete and adaptive aids in place when he or she arrives. In the early  		months of the Rider initiative, there were no provisions to contract for home  		modifications or purchase needed supplies before the participants  		transition day, making it difficult, if not impossible, to have the new living  		situation ready for occupancy. Changes have been made in the policy with  		respect to home modifications and DME, now allowing work to be contracted or  		orders placed before the client leaves the nursing facility. However, payment  		for these services and supplies still cannot be made by the CBA program until  		the client has been discharged from the facility. </p>
<p><b><i>Issues Related to CBA Services </i></b></p>
<p>Informants also identified issues with respect to certain services. Most  		often mentioned were personal attendant services and minor home modifications.  		Attendant services are a repeated source of problems; informants cited  		attendant no-shows and high turnover rates, although many described procedures  		in place to deal with the problem of no-shows. These problems are, of course,  		not limited to the CBA program and not attributable to the Rider but,  		nonetheless, are perceived as affecting the programs capacity to function  		smoothly for all participants. </p>
<p>Finding reliable and available contractors for minor home modifications  		was seen as a persistent problem, one that home health agencies did not feel  		well-equipped to address since such work has not been a standard part of home  		health services. Assuring the quality of the work was seen as difficult, and  		many agencies cited frequent problems with shoddy or incomplete work and delays  		by contractors. Agencies in different regions have taken different approaches  		to resolving the difficulties with home modifications. One agency had solved  		the problem by having a home modifications contractor on staff. In Abilene and  		Brownwood, local college students volunteer to paint houses and do yard work in  		the homes of transitioners, but most home modifications must meet ADA  		specifications and are not appropriate for volunteers.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> Rural informants reported that finding  		contractors was particularly difficult and so volunteers in any capacity were  		an important part of the effort. </p>
<p>One informant suggested that one way to address the problems with minor  		home modifications would be to carve this benefit out of home health  		agencies responsibilities. It was felt that a carve-out to a designated  		network of contractors would help assure the availability of contractors when  		needed, would help develop an expertise in the types of modifications  		frequently needed by this population, and would allow the establishment of a  		standard quality control system for this service. In addition, monitoring the  		quality of modifications would be facilitated through the consolidation of the  		contracts for this work. Because minor home modifications should be completed  		before a client returns home, the cost of delays in completing such work  		include the longer duration of continuing nursing facility care prior to  		transition. Thus, it was suggested that both cost and quality considerations  		could be well served by a carve-out.</p>
<p><b><i>Issues Related to Non-CBA Services </i></b></p>
<p>The most difficult issues identified were those that concern components  		of caring for an individual in the community that were beyond the scope of the  		CBA program itself. Respondents identified housing, transportation, and a  		medical home (specifically, a supervising physician for home health services)  		as among these non-program issues that affect the implementation of the  		initiative. </p>
<p>Housing was identified by most informants as one of the most difficult  		issues to resolve. Once an ISP is established and receipt of services is  		authorized under a Medicaid community-based waiver program, the primary factor  		determining the length of time it takes to make the transition from nursing  		home to community is the ease or difficulty in finding a suitable home for the  		individual. The challenges include identifying a place that is safe given the  		individuals limitations and that accommodates their physical or mental  		disabilities, as well as identifying a source of transportation to and from,  		for example, health care providers, pharmacies, and grocery stores. </p>
<p>Other than family homes and ALFs, affordable housing that met the needs  		of people at risk of institutionalization appeared to be scarce in all regions.  		Advocates did not view housing located in areas without accessible  		transportation as acceptable. However, affordable housing was often outside of  		densely settled areas and less likely to be accessible to public transportation  		or within the service area of para-transit services targeted at people with  		disabilities. </p>
<p>The challenge of finding housing varied by region, with estimates of the  		time required ranging from one to two months up to as long as four to five  		months. In Ft. Worth, where moves to ALFs from nursing facilities were common,  		a smooth transition could take place in as little as 30 days from eligibility  		determination. In Abilene, site visit informants cited a shortage of available  		units in ALFs as a critical factor that delays transitions of nursing home  		residents to the community. Residents with a preference for assisted living or  		with no other option might have to wait months for a unit to become available.  		In Brownwood, where ALFs were not available, respondents said that moving in  		with family would be the only option for many nursing home residents interested  		in Rider participation.</p>
<p>The long-term provision of community-based medical services requires  		finding a physician in the community to accept the individual as a patient.  		While the physician at the nursing facility from which participants transition  		can prescribe home health services for up to 30 days, clients must find a  		physician in the community to provide ongoing care, including the prescription  		of continued home health services. Nursing facility social workers reported  		that residents with a brief stay in the facility often could return to a  		physician they had before admission, but long-term residents or those new to  		the community often required help identifying a physician. </p>
<p><b><i>Differences in Rural Areas </i></b></p>
<p>Many of the issues discussed here are different in rural than in urban  		areas; some are more acute, and some are specific to rural areas. Living  		independently in rural areas can pose special challenges for the elderly and  		disabled that must be addressed before they can leave a nursing facility and  		return home. In particular, the risk of social isolation can be a serious  		problem due to the lower population density in rural areas. Finding volunteers  		to check on the homebound is an ongoing task. Accessible transportation is  		critical for independence, but more difficult to arrange in rural areas, since  		rural public transportation systems are generally less well developed than  		urban systems, and medical transportation systems may be less well developed.  		Where public transportation exists, the service varies by county and some were  		said not to be well suited to the needs of peoples with disabilities. The labor  		issues in home health agencies noted above can be even greater in rural areas.  		Informants suggested that allowing family members to serve as attendants could  		alleviate this problem to some degree but that quality monitoring could then  		become trickier. </p>
<p>Basic services, such as grocery stores and pharmacies, are more  		dispersed geographically in rural areas posing particular problems for the less  		mobile. The problems of finding a physician in rural areas may be greater than  		in more densely settled areas. Access to specialty care may be hard to arrange  		since rural specialists are often shared among several towns in a broad service  		area. Some specialized rehabilitation services may not be available. Problems  		of provider access, however, affect rural areas generally and are not specific  		to the CBA program. Nonetheless, arranging necessary care for transitioners to  		rural areas may be more difficult because of provider shortages. Respondents  		noted that, despite all of these challenges, many clients who have lived in  		rural communities all their lives choose to return to their home and  		communities, and the value of having this choice should not be understated.</p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Facility Participation </i></b></p>
<p>Rider transitions are occurring in many different types of facilities  		and in all regions. This wide participation suggests that there is broad  		knowledge about the program across all types of facilities and that nursing  		facility residents in all regions are being given the opportunity to transition  		back to the community. </p>
<p>Statewide, 71 percent of nursing facilities with residents potentially  		eligible for the Rider had at least one resident who transitioned to the  		community using the Rider (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table1">table 1</a>). The majority of  		facilities in each region have participated, though regional variation is  		evident.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note26">26</a></font></sup> While  		participation in the initiative has been broad, transition volume at most  		facilities is fairly low. About two-thirds of the 832 facilities with at least  		one transition had five or fewer transitions over the first three years that  		the Rider was in effect, and fewer than 10 percent of facilities had relatively  		high transition activity with more than ten transitions. Specifically, a little  		more than one-third of participating facilities had only one or two  		transitions, while just under one-third had three to five transitions. The  		remaining third represented a range of Rider activity. Fifteen facilities had  		20 or more transitions, with one of these having 87 transitions. The patterns  		described statewide are observed in both urban and rural counties (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table2">table 2</a>). </p>
<p>The size of the population that has opted to use the Rider--nearly 8,000  		people since September 2001 and as of March 2004--is small relative to the size  		of the nursing facility population (approximately 63,000), as well as the  		population of adults receiving services through the CBA program (approximately  		30,000) and the population that has expressed formal interest in the CBA  		program by placing themselves on the interest list (approximately 64,000).  		Thus, the direct impact of the Rider initiative on nursing facility occupancy  		and the larger market for long-term care services, at the time of this study,  		was small. With the advent of a comprehensive MFP program in 2005, the  		cumulative total participation from the Rider and the MFP program has climbed  		to nearly 11,000.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note27">27</a></font></sup>  		While the effect on nursing facilities can be expected to increase, the pace of  		transitions suggests that the changes will be incremental in nature, which  		would allow the nursing facility market to adjust over time.</p>
<p>The small number of participants using the Rider to access  		community-based services relative to the large nursing facility resident  		population reflects both the capacity for completing the process of transition  		and the demand for transitioning among nursing facility residents. On the one  		hand, the geographic and facility-level dispersion of the vast majority of  		Rider participants indicates that nursing facility residents who want to leave  		and have the resources in their community to do so likely will have this  		opportunity. On the other hand, our site visit study indicated that the process  		of assisting nursing facility residents with the move to a community setting is  		resource intensive with respect to state and regional administrative support  		services. In addition, the resources of participants, both psychological and  		familial, can be taxed by the transition. In all likelihood, these constraints  		affect the number of participants that the initiative can serve, and may also  		explain the low number of transitions from most facilities. </p>
<p><b><i>Quality Monitoring</i></b></p>
<p>Formal quality monitoring under the Rider follows the procedures of the  		waiver programs that Rider participants enter. Under CBA, DADS caseworkers  		contact clients by phone 30 days after they leave the nursing facility, and  		again by phone after six months. At one year, they visit the client in person.  		At the six and twelve-month interviews, a client satisfaction survey is  		administered to those still in the CBA program. The ISP is established for a  		year but reviewed by the caseworker quarterly for appropriateness. </p>
<p>DADS is responsible for monitoring the home health agencies, which are,  		in turn, responsible for monitoring the quality of care provided by their  		employees. At the beginning of the Rider initiative, home health agency  		contracts for the CBA waiver program were open-ended. By the time of our site  		visit, DADS had begun letting contracts for one year at time. DADS staff  		reported that the defined contract period makes it easier to deal with problem  		agencies, and there have been cases of contracts that have not been renewed.  		DADS staff monitors agency performance by sampling client records to monitor  		adherence to process regulations. Monitoring visits to the agencies are made in  		the tenth month of each contract. Client satisfaction interviews are conducted  		either by telephone or face-to-face annually for all CBA clients.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Non-DADS personnel also assist in quality monitoring, either formally or  		informally. Some nursing facility social workers make follow-up calls to  		residents after transition. Many make themselves available for phone calls from  		former residents post-transition, but they report receiving few calls. In a  		more formal process, volunteers in Abilene with the Meals-on-Wheels program  		provide an additional level of monitoring to rural CBA clients. They record any  		problems observed or reported by the clients they visited and fax the report to  		DADS regional staff and caseworkers for review and follow-up.</p>
<p>Most day-to-day issues with quality of service are handled through the  		DADS complaint procedures, which allow a client to contact their DADS  		caseworker to report problems. The caseworker is required to follow-up  		immediately with the service provider and assist in a resolution. Clients often  		use this means to report that an attendant has not shown up or to report  		specific problems with an attendant. Informants noted that complaints often  		arise out of disputes between attendants and clients over the attendants  		tasks and responsibilities. These cases can usually be resolved by the  		caseworker through client education on the attendants  		responsibilities.</p>
<p>A substantial minority of Rider participants live in ALFs. Some  		advocates and nursing facility personnel expressed discomfort at the lower  		level of regulation and supervision of these facilities compared with nursing  		facilities or home health agencies. Nursing facilities, particularly, expressed  		concern about the lack of a level playing field between community-based  		services and nursing facility care with respect to regulation, particularly in  		the area of quality assurance. Partly in response to such concerns, statewide  		monitoring of ALFs began in March 2004.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Quality monitoring processes are evolving as community-based care  		becomes more common. DADS staff noted that some areas of quality assurance were  		under review and that new procedures could be expected. Added oversight might  		improve quality but will almost certainly add costs. With greater opportunities  		for independence come greater opportunities for quality problems. In the new  		order of consumer choice in long-term care services, the state will have to  		decide how much responsibility it must assume for the quality of the services  		in the different places that clients choose to receive services. </p>
<h3>Rider Participants and Comparison Groups</h3>
<p>In order to help identify which types of residents are more likely to  		use the Rider to move to the community, we compared Rider participants with  		nursing facility residents. Large differences in the make-up of the Rider  		population as compared with the nursing facility population can point to groups  		for whom transition might be more difficult. Qualitative information gathered  		in the site visits helped illuminate possible mechanisms behind the differences  		thus identified. </p>
<p>In our comparisons between Rider participants and CBA clients, we focus  		on service use. Overall service use in each group is driven by differences in  		the composition of the groups but also by differences in service use between  		similar people within each group. We considered both of these factors here.  		Difference in service use also point to possible gaps in community-based  		services. Again, information from the site visits helps provide context for the  		quantitative findings.</p>
<p><b><i>Characteristics of Rider Participants </i></b></p>
<p><i>Demographics</i></p>
<p>Rider participants are predominantly elderly, with only one-third under  		the age of 65 (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table3">table 3</a>). About two-thirds of Rider  		participants are female, reflecting the over-representation of women among the  		elderly. Just under one-third of Rider participants live in rural areas. About  		two-thirds of Rider participants are White and non-Hispanic in ethnic origin,  		about one-fifth are Hispanic, and one-tenth are non-Hispanic Black. </p>
<p><i>Nursing facility tenure</i></p>
<p>Analysis of Rider participants length of stay in a nursing  		facility suggests that the Rider initiative is reaching both long-term and  		short-term residents of nursing facilities. The average length of stay in the  		nursing facility prior to transition is over seven months with more than  		one-third of Rider participants statewide residing in the facility for six  		months or more. About one in ten Rider participants had a nursing facility stay  		of less than 40 days.</p>
<p><i>Expected level of care dependence</i></p>
<p>All recipients of long-term care services under Medicaid are classified  		based on the Texas Index for Level of Effort (TILE) that summarizes the  		clients care needs and medical stability and is the basis for nursing  		facility reimbursement under Medicaid. The TILE classes are based on medical  		diagnosis, limitations in activities of daily living, expected level of care  		needed, the presence of mental or behavioral conditions that affect staffing  		resources required, and receipt of rehabilitation services. Presence of family  		support or informal caregivers does not influence TILE determination. </p>
<p>TILE classes range from 211 to 201. A lower TILE number indicates a  		higher level of care or greater staffing resources needed to meet the  		clients needs and a higher reimbursement to nursing facilities.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note30">30</a></font></sup> For ease of analysis, we  		condensed some TILE classes with proximate payment rates, based on the  		assumption that grouping individuals by the resources required to support an  		individual would allow the most policy-relevant comparisons.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are Rider participants in all TILE classes (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table4">table 4</a>). About one-third are in TILE 211, a clinically  		stable group with the highest level of functioning and lowest number of  		limitations (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table4">table 4</a>). Another 8 percent are stable with  		the highest level of functioning, but have a mental/behavioral condition  		requiring additional daily staff intervention (TILE 210). People with moderate  		care needs (TILE classes 207-209) make up just over one-quarter of Rider  		participants. Almost one in five are classified as receiving rehabilitation  		services (TILE 202). Fewer than 10 percent are classified as having high care  		needs (TILEs 204-206), and fewer than 5 percent require heavy care (TILEs 201  		and 203). Variation between urban and rural areas in the distribution of TILE  		classes suggests the rural participants are somewhat more care dependent and  		have a greater number of ADL limitations, although the differences are not  		large (data not shown). </p>
<p><i>Diagnoses of physical or mental illness</i></p>
<p>In addition to TILE classification, each recipient can be assigned up to  		five concurrent diagnoses per claim based on ICD-9 classification.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note32">32</a></font></sup> We present information here on  		the proportion of each group that had a particular diagnosis as one of his or  		her five diagnoses (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table5">table 5</a>). ICD-9 codes are grouped  		into their major classification of diagnoses, except for stroke, a condition  		that often requires rehabilitation.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note33">33</a></font></sup> Where applicable, residents are also  		assigned a diagnosis of a behavioral condition or mental illness. Specific  		groups of behavioral and mental illnesses were also identified based on their  		prevalence or potential policy relevance.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note34">34</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The diagnoses of physical illness among Rider participants, with only a  		couple of exceptions, vary little by age, and these variations are as would be  		expected in the population. Over 40 percent of Rider participants have a  		diagnosed mental illness. The most common mental illness diagnosis is  		depression among those younger than 65 (27 percent) and dementia among those  		over 65 (20 percent). </p>
<p><b><i>Characteristics of Rider Participants as Compared to Nursing  		Facility Residents </i></b></p>
<p>A comparison of the characteristics of Rider participants with those of  		nursing facility residents can help policy-makers understand which types of  		long-term care clients are more likely to access community care through the  		Rider initiative. Here we present notable differences between Rider  		participants and nursing facility residents in demographic characteristics,  		TILE class and physical and mental/behavioral diagnoses. We then consider  		differences across regions and between rural and urban areas.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i>Demographics</i></p>
<p>With a few exceptions, Rider participant characteristics reflect the  		characteristics of nursing facility residents, the population from which they  		transition (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table3">table 3</a>). Nursing facility residents are  		generally older than Rider participants, and half as many are under the age of  		65. Hispanics are slightly over-represented in the Rider population compared to  		the nursing facility population, while non-Hispanic Blacks are slightly  		under-represented. </p>
<p><i>TILE class</i></p>
<p>Rider participants are more likely than nursing facility residents to be  		in the lowest care need category (TILE 211) (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table4">table 4</a>). A  		similar share (between 10 and 20 percent) of Rider participants and nursing  		home residents are receiving rehabilitation services (TILE 202), possibly  		reflecting a medical event that led to nursing facility admission. Somewhat  		surprisingly, the proportion of each group classed as high care  		(TILEs 204-206) is similar at about 7 percent. However, as would be expected,  		those classified as needing heavy care (TILEs 201 and 203) are found more often  		in nursing facilities (5 percent) than among Rider participants (3 percent).  		</p>
<p><i>Physical illness</i></p>
<p>Reported diagnoses support the association of medical events and nursing  		facility admission among Rider participants. Rider participants in both age  		categories (over or under age 65) are more likely than nursing home residents  		to have a diagnosis of stroke or cardiovascular disease other than stroke (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table5">table 5</a>). Rider participants are also more likely to have a  		diagnosis of respiratory system diseases such as pneumonia, influenza, and  		bronchitis than all nursing facility residents. Rider participants and nursing  		facility residents in both age groups have similar diagnosis profiles although  		there are differences in the prevalence of conditions between the two groups.  		</p>
<p><i>Mental illness</i></p>
<p>The mental illness profile of Rider participants resembles that of  		nursing facility residents, but, while the pattern is similar, in all but one  		instance the prevalence of each diagnosis is greater among nursing facility  		residents than among Rider participants (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table5">table 5</a>). The  		one exception is the higher prevalence of diagnosed depression among younger  		Rider participants than among younger nursing facility residents. The largest  		difference is seen in the percentage with a diagnosis of dementia. In both age  		groups, the percentage of nursing facility residents with diagnosed dementia is  		about 50 percent higher than the percentage of Rider participants, thus  		supporting the perception among site visit informants that these residents are  		more difficult to transition. </p>
<p><i>Geographic differences</i></p>
<p>Site visit informants in different regions offered different  		observations about the characteristics of those who transitioned. In Abilene  		and Brownwood, informants described the majority of the Rider participant  		population as elderly but without catastrophic illness, typically  		with a nursing facility stay of under six months. In Ft. Worth, where assisted  		living placements were much more common, informants reported relatively more  		middle-aged disabled clients with no family support. In McAllen, the DADS  		regional office reported that their clients were the elderly. These site visit  		comments are generally supported by the data discussed here.</p>
<p>In general, there are differences in the rural/urban distribution of  		Medicaid long-term care recipients within regions. For example, in Region 1,  		the majority of nursing facility residents (54 percent) live in rural areas  		while the majority of Rider participants (61 percent) live in urban areas. In  		Region 5, the trend is reversed with rural area residents disproportionately  		represented among Rider participants (76 percent) relative to nursing facility  		residents (59 percent). Overall, our analysis shows variation in the  		characteristics of recipients across regions and in rural versus urban  		counties, which suggests possible geographic differences in demand for  		services, community capacity for services, or differences in implementation of  		the Rider (data not shown).<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note36">36</a></font></sup> </p>
<p><b><i>Rider Participants Place of Residence in the  		Community</i></b></p>
<p>The variable indicating where Rider participants and other CBA clients  		lived once they entered the CBA program was not made available to us in the  		data set we used for the quantitative analysis. The service use data, however,  		did include information on the use of assisted living by Rider participants and  		CBA clients.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note37">37</a></font></sup>  		Therefore, here we cite DADS statistics on where Rider participants live  		followed by a discussion of trends in the use of ALFs based on our own  		analysis. The differences in ALF use are particularly important since, as will  		be discussed later, these differences are associated with differences in  		service use and costs between the two groups.</p>
<p>DADS statistics<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note38">38</a></font></sup> for Rider participants show that 19 percent  		are living in the community alone, 34 percent in alternative residential care  		settings such as assisted living or group homes, 42 percent living with family,  		and the rest (about 4 percent) in adult foster care or in the community with  		other waiver program participants. These living arrangements vary markedly  		across the state, as can be seen in the statistics for the DADS service regions  		we visited. In Region 2 (headquartered in Abilene), clients who had moved to  		the community were almost evenly divided among living alone, alternative  		residential care, and living with family. In contrast, in Region 3 (Dallas/Ft.  		Worth), over half (54 percent) of Rider clients were in alternative residential  		care, and, in Region 11 (McAllen), 62 percent of Rider clients were living with  		family. </p>
<p>In our quantitative analysis, we found large differences between Rider  		participants and non-Rider CBA clients in the use of assisted living, with  		Rider participants more than five times likelier to enter an ALF than CBA  		clients (see <a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table6">table 6</a>). About one-third (34 percent) of  		Rider participants statewide enter ALFs, a much higher percentage than CBA  		clients (6 percent). ALF use is twice as common in urban areas (40 percent) as  		in rural areas (19 percent) for Rider participants, with a similar pattern  		though at a much lower level for CBA clients (8 versus 4 percent,  		respectively). </p>
<p>Among Rider participants, use of ALFs also varies by TILE class. About  		half of those assigned the highest TILE categories (indicating the lowest  		expected level of care needs), are living in ALFs. In comparison, less than  		one-third (27 percent) of Rider participants with TILE 202 (rehabilitation) and  		less than one-quarter (22 percent) needing moderate care live in ALFs. Some  		Rider participants classified as needing heavy care live in ALFs, but this  		arrangement is relatively rare (2 percent). </p>
<p>The greater reliance on assisted living by Rider participants compared  		to CBA clients persists across other subgroups as well, including regions, age  		groups, and racial/ethnic groups. These comparative statistics do not allow us  		to say what influences a participants choice of living arrangement. The  		three regions with majority Hispanic populations, Regions 8, 10, and 11,  		include both the highest and the lowest prevalence of ALF use. Statewide, rural  		areas show lower use of ALFs than urban areas but the regions with the lowest  		proportion of rural residents (all under 10 percent) vary in the percentage of  		their Rider participants using assisted living from 29 percent to 52 percent.  		Regions that have a high share of rural residents (Regions 1, 2/9, 4, and 5)  		also show a range of ALF service use from 25 to 49 percent. </p>
<p>Differences by region might be driven by the supply of assisted living,  		which varies dramatically across the state. For example, the state reports over  		100 Medicaid contracts for assisted living in Region 3, but only four such  		contracts in Region 11. Regional differences in ALF use among CBA clients are  		small, and the differences do not follow the regional distribution of use among  		Rider participants, suggesting that there are other important influences in  		addition to supply. Multivariate analysis would be required to sort out the  		effects of such factors as supply of ALF units, cultural preferences, and care  		needs.</p>
<p>Site visit informants suggested that some Rider participants choose  		assisted living in part because of the limited options available to individuals  		with little family support or high-cost ISPs that would have unacceptably high  		costs for CBA if they did not enter assisted living. Returning to the community  		living situation they had prior to entering the nursing facility might not be  		possible for many Rider participants, especially those who have had an extended  		facility stay and whose family home may no longer be available and/or whose  		informal support network may have dispersed. </p>
<p><b><i>Service Use of Rider Participants and Other CBA Clients  		</i></b></p>
<p>In this section, we present findings on the share of Rider participants  		and CBA clients that received various services available through the CBA  		program during the first six months after entering CBA first for all  		participants, and then by geographic area, racial/ethnic differences, and  		cognitive/functional status.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note39">39</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The data show that, statewide, Rider participants are less likely than  		non-Rider CBA clients to receive almost all services. The exceptions are  		nursing services, specific therapies (physical, occupational, and speech), and  		adult foster care. Nursing services are necessary to administer ISPs and nearly  		all clients (more than 95 percent) in both groups receive these services, while  		very few clients (under 2 percent) receive specific therapies and adult foster  		care. Nursing facility stays are roughly similar between CBA clients and Rider  		participants.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note40">40</a></font></sup> Only 4  		percent of Rider participants and 5 percent of non-Rider CBA clients appear to  		have been admitted to a nursing facility during their first six months in CBA  		(<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table7">table 7</a>). </p>
<p>As noted above, Rider participants are much more likely than CBA clients  		to be residents of ALFs. Most Medicaid-covered or CBA-covered services  		including nursing services, adaptive aids, medical supplies, and therapies, are  		available to both ALF and non-ALF clients.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note41">41</a></font></sup> However, some services, such as meal  		delivery and emergency response services (ERS), are included in the services  		provided by ALFs and are not billed separately for residents of ALFs. Other  		services, such as minor home modifications, personal assistance services (PAS),  		and adult foster care are not financed under CBA for clients in assisted  		living. Given the stark difference in ALF use between Rider and CBA clients,  		notable differences in the use of other services is expected in the full  		populations (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table7">table 7</a>). Therefore, we look at service  		patterns separately for ALF and non-ALF residents (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table8">table  		8</a>).</p>
<p>When clients in assisted living are excluded, there are few differences  		between the Rider and CBA groups in the proportion receiving each service.  		(There are, however, differences between the two groups in the intensity of  		service use, as discussed in the section on expenditures.) For clients not  		residing in assisted living, PAS play a critical role in the ISP according to  		service claims data, with 88 percent of Rider participants and 91 percent of  		CBA clients using personal attendants. Adaptive aids and medical supplies are  		used by about half of the non-ALF clients in each population, and home  		modifications are provided to just over one-third of non-ALF Rider participants  		and CBA clients. </p>
<p><i>Geographic and racial/ethnic differences</i></p>
<p>Among clients not residing in ALFs, Rider participants and CBA clients  		in rural areas are more likely to receive some services than are those in urban  		areas. Although the differences are generally small, the pattern is consistent.  		Both Rider participants and CBA clients in rural areas are somewhat more likely  		to receive ERS, meal delivery, and adaptive aids. ERS and meal delivery  		services may be particularly important links to the community for clients in  		more rural areas where the broader social service networks may be less  		developed and clients may be at greater risk of isolation. The difference in  		adaptive aids may be related to the greater frailty of rural participants as  		evidenced by their TILE class assignment noted above.</p>
<p>There are also differences in service use among non-ALF residents across  		regions (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table9">table 9</a>). For example, use of meal delivery  		service for both Rider participants and CBA clients in Region 2/9 (29 and 39  		percent, respectively) and Region 4 (31 and 28 percent, respectively) is much  		higher than in other regions. Regional differences might reflect variation in  		the availability of community-based services. Caseworkers in Abilene (Region  		2/9) described a large network that served the dual purpose of meal delivery  		and monitoring residents for personal safety on behalf of the regional DADS  		office. There is also wide regional variation in the receipt of minor home  		modifications, with use ranging from 23 percent of Rider participants and 20  		percent of CBA clients in Region 3 to 55 percent of Rider participants and 60  		percent of CBA clients in Region 11. </p>
<p>There are notable differences in service use among non-ALF residents  		between Hispanics and other groups. For example, Hispanics have lower rates of  		use for ERS and meal delivery compared to non-Hispanics of either race. This  		difference might be explained by a greater reliance on extended families for  		support among Hispanics receiving community-based services, as suggested in our  		site visits. Hispanics are more likely to receive minor home modifications, a  		difference that is less easily explained, but which is consistent with the high  		utilization of this service in Region 11, which has a high concentration of  		Hispanic residents (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table10">table 10</a>). </p>
<p><i>Differences by functional and cognitive status</i></p>
<p>If the differences in service use between Rider participants and CBA  		clients were driven by differences in the use of ALF, we would expect to see  		the greatest leveling of differences in those TILE categories with the greatest  		difference in ALF use. The greatest difference in ALF use is seen in TILE  		category 211, which has a high prevalence of ALF use (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table11">table  		11</a>). For the most frequently used services (PAS, adaptive aids, medical  		supplies, minor home modifications, ERS, and meals), the differences in use  		between Rider participants and CBA clients in TILE 211 ranged from a high of 42  		percentage points for PAS to a low of nine percentage points for medical  		supplies, when both ALF and non-ALF recipients are considered. When ALF  		recipients are excluded, these differences decline to seven percentage points  		for PAS and three percentage points for medical supplies. This finding suggests  		that although ALF use explains a large part of the observed differences in  		service use between Rider participants and CBA clients, other differences  		remain in service use patterns. </p>
<p>Service mix by TILE class for non-ALF residents generally demonstrates  		patterns consistent with expectations about the relative demand for services  		between groups of varying levels of care dependence (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table12">table  		12</a>). Differences in service use within a TILE class between Rider  		participants and CBA clients are likely driven by either a higher demand for  		service by one group based on greater frailty or a difference in the process by  		which services are assigned for Rider participants compared to CBA clients.  		Better data on frailty and mobility (e.g., specificity about ADL limitations)  		and family support analyzed in a multivariate framework, as well as further  		investigation at the local level on how services plans are established for each  		group, would contribute to a better understanding of the reasons for observed  		differences in service mix for these two populations. Our conversations with  		DADS officials suggest that assignment of TILE classes for nursing facility  		residents and, hence, for Rider participants, are driven by different payment  		incentives than for CBA clients,<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note42">42</a></font></sup> which could contribute to the observed  		differences.</p>
<p><b><i>Recipient Status after CBA Entry</i></b></p>
<p>Transition from a nursing facility is not the end goal of the Rider  		initiative. Rather, the initiative seeks to enable Medicaid long-term care  		recipients to live in the least restrictive setting possible, in accordance  		with the <i>Olmstead</i> decision. Therefore, it is important to understand how  		Rider participants fare once they leave the nursing facility. Here we consider  		measures of recipient status six and twelve months after leaving the nursing  		facility.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note43">43</a></font></sup> We compare  		Rider participants to CBA clients in order to determine how these two similarly  		frail populations fare after entering the CBA program. We look at the share of  		each group that remained in the CBA program, that was residing in a nursing  		facility, that were reported as deceased, and that had left the CBA program and  		whose status was unknown. We note important differences across functional and  		cognitive status groups represented by TILE classes.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note44">44</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Over 80 percent of both the Rider and CBA populations remained in the  		CBA program in the sixth month after entry into CBA. Program retention was  		slightly lower among Rider participants than among CBA clients (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table13">table 13</a>). While the proportion remaining on CBA declined  		over time, 71 percent of Rider participants and 85 percent of CBA clients were  		still receiving CBA services in the twelfth month. Very few members of either  		group statewide were residing in a nursing facility in the twelfth month after  		entry into the CBA program. These findings suggest that the CBA population  		overall is relatively stable.</p>
<p><i>Mortality</i></p>
<p>By the twelfth month after entering the CBA program, 10 percent of Rider  		participants and less than 1 percent of CBA clients were reported to have  		deceased. Since a larger share of CBA clients was classified in less  		care-dependent TILE class relative to Rider participants, it is reasonable to  		expect a lower mortality rate among CBA clients. However, the share deceased  		represents a doubling of the share at six months for Rider participants, but no  		change for CBA clients, a plateau that is contrary to expectations and  		indicative of a possible data quality problem.<sup><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, the share of clients that appears to be no longer receiving  		any Medicaid service and therefore has unknown status by the twelfth month  		after program entry is 19 percent among Rider participants and 7 percent among  		CBA clients. Factors causing program attrition cannot be ascertained from the  		data. As with mortality reports, these shares represent a doubling of the share  		with unknown status at six months for Rider participants, but no change for CBA  		clients. State officials expressed concern that not all incidence of mortality  		has been captured in the database.<sup><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note46">46</a></sup> Thus, it  		is likely that some share with unknown status has deceased, and no firm  		conclusions about mortality rates should be drawn. </p>
<p><i>Comparisons across TILE classes</i></p>
<p>These patterns were consistent across regions and for Rider and CBA  		participants of different ages. As might be expected, the most notable  		differences were found by TILE class (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table14">table 14</a>). Among  		Rider participants, those classified with high care needs (TILE 204-206) were  		the least likely to remain on CBA and most likely to have deceased by the end  		of the first year on CBA, with 66 percent of this TILE class still in CBA and  		17 percent deceased. In addition, a high proportion (25 percent) of TILE 202  		(rehabilitation) Rider participants had left the program with unknown status at  		twelve months. With these exceptions and with consideration for omissions in  		the data, we found that the CBA program appears to be able to provide the  		opportunity for community living for a very wide range of recipients through  		the Rider. </p>
<p>The experience of participants in two TILE classes is illuminating.  		First, although, as noted above, nursing facility residents in TILE class 210  		(stable, with mental/ behavioral conditions) were less likely to have left the  		nursing facility under the Rider, Rider participants in this TILE class are  		about as likely as the average Rider participant to have remained in CBA at  		twelve months, 72 percent for TILE 210 (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table14">table 14</a>) versus  		71 percent of all TILE classes (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table13">table 13</a>). This finding  		suggests that many recipients in this TILE class are suitable candidates for  		community-based care. Second, as we also noted above, nursing facility  		residents needing high care (TILE 204-206) were less likely to have left the  		nursing facility under the Rider and constitute a very small share of all Rider  		participants. Despite the initial challenge of finding suitable arrangements  		outside a nursing facility, the share of Rider participants in this TILE class  		remaining on CBA at the end of twelve months (74 percent) was comparable to  		retention for less care-dependent classes. </p>
<p><i>Other status findings</i></p>
<p>Information collected during the site visits provides perspectives from  		DADS caseworkers, ombudsmen, and nursing facility social workers who had  		witnessed first hand a variety of transitions. Overall, there was widespread  		agreement among informants in all of the sites visited that the majority of  		clients who had moved to the community were better off than they had been in  		the nursing facility. However, informants also characterized the circumstances  		of transitions for individuals as varying widely. </p>
<p>Although caseworkers and advocates cited the benefits of transitions to  		the community, such as improvement in clients mental health or outlook,  		not all assessments of the transition experience were positive. Nursing  		facility staff and some ombudsmen were more circumspect. Some recounted stories  		of specific clients who were not successful in transitioning. Lack of community  		systems to properly manage complex medication regimens for the severely  		mentally ill was cited as a problem and a precursor to return to a nursing  		facility for some residents who transitioned to ALFs or into other residential  		situations in the community. The risk of social isolation was also cited as a  		problem for the elderly and physically impaired that could be particularly  		acute for clients who live alone in sparsely settled rural areas. However,  		isolation alone did not necessarily appear to lead to a return to a nursing  		facility. </p>
<p>Provider opinions on the problems experienced in transitions frequently  		reflected a lack of confidence in other providers to meet the needs of clients.  		For example, nursing facilities were more likely to express concern that ALFs  		were accepting clients beyond their capability to serve, while advocates  		pointed to the individuals need for privacy and independence that could  		not be met in a nursing facility. Nursing facility administrators pointed to  		the much lower level of supervision and regulation for quality monitoring in  		community care settings and asserted that the resulting environment left open  		the possibility of quality of care problems going unrecognized once the  		resident had left the nursing facility. Confirmation of these perspective was  		beyond the scope of this project.</p>
<h3>Nursing Facility Industry Response to the  		Initiative</h3>
<p>There was some concern as the Rider initiative began that the nursing  		facility industry would not cooperate in an initiative that would likely reduce  		its share of the long-term care market, particularly in Texas, where nursing  		facility occupancy rates are relatively low (73 percent, on average, in  		2003<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note47">47</a></font></sup>). The range of  		possible negative nursing facility reactions to the program include active  		resistance to allowing workers to contact nursing facility residents about  		participation, indifference reflected in a lack of cooperation but with no  		hostility to the initiative, and reluctant participation. The nature of our  		qualitative research made identification of these reactions unlikely (see  		limitations of the study, above), although the quantitative analysis shows  		broad nursing facility participation, suggesting that such negative reactions  		were not widespread. </p>
<p>We did identify two distinct positive reactions in our qualitative  		research. The first appears to contribute to the goal of the program to expand  		the range of long-term care options to include less restrictive settings backed  		up by nursing facility care. Specifically, some nursing facilities reported  		enthusiasm for the program and said that they had incorporated the program into  		their business plan. Their rationale was that if elderly or disabled community  		residents knew that a nursing facility stay could be temporary, they might be  		less reluctant to enter for rehabilitation or respite. Some nursing facilities  		reported marketing this aspect of their care in connection with the Rider. </p>
<p>The other type of positive reaction implies a broader interpretation of  		the aims of the initiative. One nursing facility reported arrangements with an  		ALF to admit their residents who had spent down and could no longer afford the  		facility fees, and then to secure their enrollment in the CBA program via the  		Rider so that they could return to the ALF with Medicaid financing. Neither  		regional staff nor the nursing facility involved thought that this  		bypass of the CBA waiting list, as they referred to it, was against  		either the letter or the spirit of the rules of the Rider. Indeed, they thought  		that this use of the Rider was consistent with the aims of the program to  		expand the use of community-based care and, more particularly, that it was in  		the best interests of the client.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note48">48</a></font></sup></p>
<p>While for individual participants, the existence of the Rider is  		significant, the Rider does not appear to be a significant issue for nursing  		facilities generally. The qualitative and quantitative data from this study do  		not suggest that there is active resistance by nursing facilities to the  		initiative. Furthermore, the total number of transitions across the state is  		small relative to the size of the nursing facility population, and the number  		from most individual facilities is small. </p>
<h3>Service Costs and Program Expenditures for Medicaid  		Long-Term Care</h3>
<p>In this section, we examine average service costs and associated program  		expenditures for Medicaid long-term care services provided through the CBA  		program for Rider participants and compare these costs and expenditures to  		those for non-Rider CBA clients.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note49">49</a></font></sup> Since we found that assisted living accounts  		for a large part of the difference in service mix between the two populations  		and since the CBA program does not cover certain services for recipients in  		ALFs, we examine costs separately for recipients who resided in an ALF at some  		point in the first six months and those who did not to determine if the  		subgroup with assisted living accounts for any observed difference in average  		costs. Because costs are likely to vary by the level of care needed, we look at  		costs by functional and cognitive status. Finally, we explore how overall  		Medicaid long-term care expenditures might be affected by changes in demand for  		Medicaid nursing facility services as a result of the Rider initiative. </p>
<p><b><i>Comparison of Long-Term Care Costs for Rider and CBA  		Clients</i></b></p>
<p>Despite differences in service mix described earlier, total average  		monthly program expenditures for all services appear to differ by only about  		$100 per client per month, with total expenditures of $1,143 per client per  		month for the Rider population compared with $1,043 for the CBA population (<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table15">table 15</a>). Average program expenditures are higher for  		Rider participants than for CBA clients across almost all subgroups (TILE  		class, rural/urban residence, age, and race/ethnicity), suggesting that no  		subgroup of Rider participants accounts for the difference in average program  		expenditures per recipient between Rider participants and CBA clients. </p>
<p>The primary reason that Rider participants are more costly on average  		than CBA clients rests with differences in the costs and service patterns of  		assisted living residents. Average monthly cost among assisted living residents  		is about $50 higher for Rider participants than for CBA clients. In addition,  		Rider participants are more than five times more likely to use assisted living.  		As a result, the average monthly program expenditure for assisted living is  		over six times greater for Rider participants compared with CBA clients ($348  		versus $56, respectively). </p>
<p><b><i>Comparison of Long-Term Care Costs by Assisted Living  		Status</i></b></p>
<p>Most of the difference in expenditures between Rider participants and  		CBA clients can be attributed to the service restrictions for ALF residents.  		However, since total expenditures for Rider participants are only slightly  		higher than for CBA clients, it is plausible that assisted living is a nearly  		cost-neutral substitute for these restricted services. Differences in care  		needs as reflected in the different TILE profiles of the two groups and in the  		timing of entry into assisted living contribute much smaller shares to the  		difference in expenditures.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note50">50</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table16">Table 16</a> presents average monthly per user  		service costs and program expenditures for recipients with ALF services in the  		first six months. The average monthly per user cost for ALF services among  		recipients with any ALF payments in the first six months after CBA entry is  		slightly higher for Rider participants ($1,152) than for CBA clients ($1,101).  		Among ALF residents, the average monthly program expenditures for all services  		was $1,241 for Rider participants and $1,195 for CBA clients.  		<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table17">Table 17</a> shows cost and expenditure estimates for  		non-ALF residents. The average monthly program expenditures for all services is  		$1,089 for Rider participants and $1,034 for CBA clients. Almost all of the  		difference per recipient appears to be explained by the higher cost per PAS  		user. </p>
<p>In summary, ALF residents have higher average expenditures than non-ALF  		residents, and a larger share of Rider participants use assisted living than  		CBA clients. The primary factors explaining the higher total average monthly  		program expenditures for Rider participants compared to CBA clients are the  		greater reliance on assisted living among Rider participants, the higher cost  		of ALF services per user among Rider participants, and, for recipients who do  		not use assisted living, the greater intensity of PAS use among Rider  		participants as compared to CBA clients. </p>
<p><b><i>Comparison of Long-Term Care Costs by Functional and Cognitive  		Status</i></b></p>
<p>Some differences in expenditures among subgroups were noted. The  		differences were greatest by functional and cognitive status, and TILE classes.  		<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table18">Table 18</a> shows average monthly program expenditures by  		service for each TILE group. As one would expect, recipients with fewer ADL  		limitations and lower care needs appear to have less intensive service needs  		and thus lower average costs in the community. Recipients in TILE 211 show the  		lowest average monthly expenditures ($973 for Rider participants and $909 for  		CBA clients), while recipients needing heavy care and with the most ADL  		limitations (TILEs 201 and 203) show the highest average monthly costs ($1,617  		for Rider participants and $1,620 for CBA clients). </p>
<p>In most TILE classes, Rider participants have higher average monthly  		expenditures than CBA clients. CBA clients have higher average monthly  		expenditures for the TILE group with mental/behavioral conditions (TILE 210)  		and those with heavy care requirements (TILE 201, 203). (These TILE groups  		combined comprise less than 20 percent of each population.) The largest  		difference in expenditures between Rider participants and CBA clients is seen  		in the group in rehabilitation (TILE 202), with the average expenditure per  		Rider participant $267 more than the per CBA client. This group accounts for 17  		percent of Rider participants but only 1 percent of CBA clients and, thus,  		contributes significantly to the overall higher average expenditures seen in  		the Rider group. </p>
<p>The differences across TILE groups is affected by whether the recipient  		resides in an ALF or not. Since a larger share of Rider participants than CBA  		clients resides in assisted living across all TILE groups, average monthly  		program expenditures for recipients who use ALFs are higher for Rider  		participants than for CBA clients. However, among recipients in TILE 211 who do  		not use assisted living, Rider participants have lower expenditures than CBA  		clients (data not shown). In the TILE 207-209 group, expenditures for  		recipients are higher for Rider participants than for CBA clients regardless of  		assisted living use (data not shown).</p>
<p><b><i>Change in Demand for Nursing Facility Admission in Response to the  		Rider</i></b></p>
<p>There has been some concern among policy-makers that the existence of  		the Rider could influence demand for Medicaid-financed long-term care.  		Specifically, there might be people who would use Medicaid-financed long-term  		care services if they were available in the community, but who do not want to  		live in a nursing facility. In the face of what has at times been a one to two  		year wait on the CBA interest list, some people might be willing to go into a  		nursing facility temporarily knowing that they would likely be able to leave  		using the Rider and receive services in the community. If this shift in demand  		were to occur, it would lead to higher overall Medicaid long-term care  		expenditures as a result of the increased use of nursing facility care, even if  		only for short stays. In addition, there would also be an increase in people on  		the CBA program with no commensurate reduction in the number of nursing  		facility residents. </p>
<p>We conducted an exploratory assessment of any evidence from the site  		visit and quantitative analysis that the demand for long-term care services has  		shifted as the result of the Rider. We developed hypotheses of how such a  		change in demand might occur based on reports by site visit informants and  		identified four indicators available in the data that might represent a demand  		effect. These indicators are: (1) a relatively short stay in the nursing  		facility prior to transition to the community, (2) a relatively low care  		dependence TILE class at nursing facility entry, (3) use of rehabilitation  		services, and (4) entry into an ALF within 40 days after CBA entry. </p>
<p>None of these indicators alone should be construed as evidence of a  		demand effect of the Rider. It is likely that each of the indicators simply  		reflects the variation in the needs of the nursing facility population from  		which the Rider population is drawn. However, in combination, these indicators  		might be suggestive of the possible influence of the Rider on demand for  		Medicaid-funded long-term care. Since there are other explanations for each of  		these indicators, it is likely that they would indicate an upper bound on this  		effect. </p>
<p>Our analysis revealed little evidence of an increase in nursing facility  		admissions as a conduit to CBA services attributable to implementation of the  		Rider. Depending on the combination of indicators used and the subgroup of  		Rider participants examined, we identified a small number of nursing facility  		admissions possibly attributable to the existence of the Rider, affecting from  		1 to 8 percent of participants.</p>
<p><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table19">Table 19</a> shows the percentage of Rider clients  		meeting each of the four criteria statewide and for urban and rural counties. A  		rapid turnaround for a client with relatively low need might signal that the  		client entered the facility in order to gain access to the CBA program.  		However, in only 3 percent of Rider cases did a participant have an assigned  		TILE class of 211 and a nursing facility of less than 40 days. A rapid  		turnaround from community to nursing facility and back to community for a  		client who moves into assisted living might give credence to the suggestion  		that a Rider participant had entered a nursing facility to later gain Medicaid  		financing for services in assisted living. However, only 3 percent of  		participants both had a nursing facility stay of less than 40 days and entered  		an ALF within 30 days of CBA program entry.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note51">51</a></font></sup> Finally, a rapid turnaround for a Rider  		participant who is receiving rehabilitation services may give credence to the  		suggestion that some patients discharged from the hospital to a nursing  		facility and then to CBA under the provisions of the Rider might otherwise have  		been discharged to the community without Medicaid funded services. The hospital  		would thus be an inadvertent access point for CBA via the Rider. However, a  		very small proportion of participants (about 1 percent) had both a short  		nursing facility stay and a TILE class of 202. </p>
<p>Since the combined criteria are not mutually exclusive, some Rider  		participants may meet more than one of the criteria. The last line of  		<a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#table12">table 12</a> shows the percentage of Rider participants who  		meet any of the three criteria in combination with a stay less than 40 days.  		These numbers can be viewed as one measure of the upper bound for the effect of  		the Rider on demand for Medicaid-financed long-term care services. Statewide,  		the upper bound is 6 percent of Rider participants with small variation between  		participants in urban and rural counties (5 and 8 percent, respectively). The  		percentage varies across regions from a high of 10 percent in Region 2 to a low  		of 2 percent in Region 6 (data not shown).</p>
<p>The fact that most facilities have had only a few transitions over a  		36-month period provides additional evidence that it is unlikely that there has  		been a redistribution in the demand for Medicaid long-term care as the result  		of nursing home behavior or changes in clients demand in response to the Rider.  		Nonetheless, we examined the few facilities with a high volume of transitions  		more closely. Of the 15 facilities with more than 20 transitions, six were in  		Region 3, which has one-fifth of all eligible nursing facilities but just over  		one-quarter of all transitions, and six were in Region 11, which has 6 percent  		of eligible nursing facilities but 13 percent of all transitions. There was one  		high-volume facility in each of Regions 4, 7, and 10. All of the 15 high-volume  		facilities are for-profit facilities, have 100 or more beds, and are dually  		certified for Medicaid and Medicare, and all but one are located in urban  		areas. High-volume facilities are more likely to be high occupancy; however,  		all occupancy levels are represented among high-volume facilities. The  		concentration of a large number of transitions among a small number of  		facilities primarily in two regions suggests that there could be some  		facility-specific or region-specific responses to the Rider initiative that  		have not developed into statewide trends.</p>
<p>These findings are at odds with our perception from the site visits that  		there was substantial activity in using the Rider mechanism to get around the  		CBA waiting list (see interim site visit report). As noted above, neither  		regional DADS employees nor advocates nor providers saw any perversion of the  		purpose of the Rider initiative in such activity. We believe, however, that the  		pathway to community-based services that was opened by the Rider was  		sufficiently new and, to those for whom the interest list had been a  		discouraging barrier to needed services, sufficiently exciting, that our  		respondents often enthusiastic descriptions of how this new access had  		helped certain of their clients may have served to overplay how widespread such  		practices are relative to what is suggested by the data. </p>
<p>Reactions to the possibility of the Rider serving unintended purposes in  		access to community-based services were very different in the three regions  		that we visited. In one region, intentional bypass of the interest list was  		openly espoused. In another, respondents volunteered that unintentional bypass  		was more likely. In the third, respondents were adamant that no one would enter  		a nursing facility in order to get community-based services. In a  		teleconference, state officials said that they had no reports of  		backfilling of nursing facility beds as a result of the Rider, and  		advocates said that nursing facility entry was so onerous that few  		people would be willing to do this.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note52">52</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Texass experience with the Rider 37/28 initiative demonstrates  		that a MFP component can be incorporated relatively easily into an existing  		Medicaid long-term care program. This far-reaching change in the states  		approach to long-term care was accomplished through the authorization of an  		accounting mechanism allowing funds to be shifted provisionally from the  		nursing facility component of the Medicaid budget to the community care  		component. In Texas, because community care programs were in place prior to  		this accounting change, the only change that the Rider made to the Medicaid  		long-term care program was, in effect, to identify the nursing facility  		population as a separate eligibility category for community care programs and  		to make this eligibility group exempt from any caps on enrollment in these  		programs. The comprehensive nature of the CBA benefits package allowed a  		diverse population of nursing facility residents to move back to residential  		settings that were more integrated in the community. In Texas, the accounting  		provisions embodied in Riders 37 and 28 later became one component in a  		comprehensive MFP funding policy, which defined a Medicaid long-term care  		program and incorporated lessons from the Rider initiative about the transition  		process.</p>
<p><b><i>Rider Participant Characteristics </i></b></p>
<p>This study found that the Rider initiative allowed adults of all ages  		with a wide range of physical and mental conditions and expected levels of need  		for assistance to return to the community. Most Rider participants were stable  		medically with relatively low care needs, as are most nursing facility  		residents. However, even nursing facility residents with the highest levels of  		expected care needs are able to move back to the community. Residents with both  		long and short lengths of stay in the facility as well as Medicaid clients  		recovering from acute episodes, such as a stroke, used the Rider to meet their  		care needs in the community. </p>
<p>Despite the diversity of characteristics seen among Rider participants,  		the likelihood that any given nursing facility resident returned to the  		community varied with resident characteristics. The quantitative analysis  		showed that elderly nursing home residents with dementia, non-elderly residents  		needing additional supervision for behavioral problems, and residents requiring  		the highest level of care were less likely to transition using the Rider.  		Younger residents, those in urban counties, and Hispanics are more likely to  		use the Rider, as are nursing home residents recovering from a stroke. Site  		visit respondents emphasized that the presence of informal support greatly  		improved the chances that a nursing home resident could transition, and  		transition more quickly, but many insisted that the lack of a strong informal  		support network was not a barrier to returning to the community. </p>
<p>The greater prevalence of diagnosed mental illness among nursing  		facility residents as compared with Rider participants and CBA clients supports  		the contention by some site visit respondents that this population is less  		well-served by the Rider initiative than others. Nonetheless, once they have  		made the transition, residents with mental or behavioral conditions appear to  		be no less likely than other types of Rider participants to be able to remain  		in the community for at least twelve months. There are possible selection  		issues associated with this finding in that those most able to remain in the  		community, either because of personal characteristics or informal support  		systems, are those who leave the facility. Alternatively, as site visit  		respondents suggested, community capacity in the area of behavioral illness  		might be the binding constraint. </p>
<p>The data also show racial/ethnic differences in the use of the Rider.  		Site visits reports of a cultural bias among Hispanics against institutional  		care for family members among Hispanics were supported by the data. Hispanics  		were under-represented in the nursing facility population and over-represented  		in the Rider population, suggesting a group that avoids entering a nursing  		facility and readily leaves when given the opportunity. The Rider initiative  		appears to contribute to making the Medicaid long-term care program more  		culturally appropriate for this group. </p>
<p>Understanding which populations are most likely to use MFP options when  		available could help identify barriers that impede return to the community. A  		comparison of the policies and procedures in place in Texas with those in other  		states could help identify which program components are associated with ease of  		transition for various populations and so promote further improvements in MFP  		policy. </p>
<p><b><i>Challenges in the Transition Process</i></b></p>
<p>The process of identifying individuals who wish to transition from  		nursing homes into Medicaid long-term care programs in the community and  		planning the transition involves a number of critical steps, which all take  		place in advance of the residents discharge from the nursing facility.  		Texas facilitates the advance coordination of transition plans by funding  		coordination activities by DADS caseworkers with Title XIX funding. A critical  		distinction between the MFP process in Texas compared to other states, such as  		Ohio,<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note53">53</a></font></sup> is Texass  		authorization of eligibility determination for community care programs,  		contracting for minor home modifications, and ordering DME prior to a  		clients return to the community. However, restrictions on payment for  		these services until the clients discharge from the nursing facility can  		still complicate the coordination of needed services by the clients first  		day in the community.</p>
<p>Several additional issues were identified by site visit respondents as  		contributing to delays in transition or complications in the placement of  		nursing facility residents in the community. Finding reliable contractors to  		make home modifications and maintaining adequate PAS were noted as ongoing  		problems, but did not appear to constitute absolute barriers to transition. The  		challenge of finding suitable housing, identifying accessible transportation  		services, and finding physicians in the community were often noted as issues  		that delayed or discouraged transition. In contrast, the supply of ALFs in some  		regions appeared to both expedite and encourage transition. The use of assisted  		living may be a symptom of an affordable housing constraint rather than a  		reflection of a preference for assisted living by the Rider population.  		Understanding how and why the choice for assisted living is made would be a  		useful area of further research.</p>
<p>Challenges in rural areas, such as transportation difficulties and the  		risk of social isolation, are not specific to Rider participants or the CBA  		program. Rather, they are a good example of the fact that, in general,  		community capacity for the provision of services contributes to some of the  		differences in the number of transitions and in service use across regions  		observed in the data and reported by site visit respondents.</p>
<p><b><i>Participant Status Over Time</i></b></p>
<p>Our limited analyses using of the Texas Medicaid long-term care data  		suggest that the majority of Rider participants across regions and of different  		ages and physical conditions remain on the CBA program after twelve months.  		Only a small minority of either Rider participants or other CBA clients returns  		to a nursing facility during this period, suggesting that the CBA program has  		been able to prevent nursing facility admissions for two groups with  		potentially different risks of admission. Reports by site visit informants  		suggest more variation in experiences after leaving nursing facilities than can  		be captured by the quantitative data. However, no data have been collected  		systematically in Texas, either through qualitative or quantitative methods, on  		client outcomes. More complete and reliable data on reasons for program  		termination, hospitalization, admission to nursing facility, and mortality  		would shed more light on outcomes for participants. Such outcome measures, and  		outcome measures specific to certain populations, such as individuals with  		mental illness, could assist in identifying areas for programmatic improvement  		over time. </p>
<p><b><i>Service Use</i></b></p>
<p>We found important differences in service use between Rider and  		non-Rider CBA clients. The primary difference is the markedly greater use of  		assisted living by Rider participants, a difference that appears to drive many,  		but not all, of the other observed differences in service mix and use.  		Multivariate analysis required to sort out the effects of a variety of  		influencing factors is beyond the scope of this study. However, both  		quantitative and qualitative data suggest factors that could influence the  		disproportionate representation of Rider participants in ALFs. Some of these  		factors, such as differences in the availability of informal support systems or  		in the need for care might also have contributed to the decision by these  		individuals to enter the nursing facility. Other factors include cultural  		preferences, availability of independent housing, and adequacy of  		transportation. Finally, some case managers and ombudsmen working to place  		nursing facility residents in the community saw assisted living as a step  		down from nursing facility care for residents who wanted to leave the  		nursing facility but who might not be ready to live more independently in the  		community. </p>
<p>Even controlling for the difference in the use of assisted living, some  		variation in service mix between Rider participants and CBA clients remains  		across regions, racial/ethnic groups, TILE classes, and age groups. The  		multivariate analysis needed to tease out the relative contributions of the  		various factors was beyond the scope of this study. However, understanding the  		factors contributing to these differences and monitoring trends in use over  		time could help predict the composition of demand for community-based services  		over the long term and could help pinpoint the cost drivers in community-based  		long-term care. </p>
<p><b><i>Program Expenditures </i></b></p>
<p>Our analysis of expenditures for Rider participants and CBA clients  		suggests that overall Rider participants have greater service intensity than  		CBA clients and, as a result, have average monthly expenditures that are about  		10 percent higher.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note54">54</a></font></sup>  		This finding is not surprising since the distribution of TILE classes among  		Rider participants shows that they are generally more care dependent than CBA  		clients. However, while the difference in expenditures is not large, TILE class  		does not fully explain it.</p>
<p>Expenditures for residents of ALFs are slightly higher than for  		non-residents, and expenditures for Rider ALF residents are higher than for  		non-Rider ALF residents. Differences in service use between residents and  		non-residents of ALFs appear to reflect logical and likely appropriate  		substitutions between ALF services and the package of PAS, minor home  		modifications, and meals available to non-ALF residents. Among non-ALF  		residents, costs for Rider participants are higher than costs for CBA clients.  		This difference is due primarily to a greater intensity in the use of PAS among  		Rider participants. The expenditure difference was not associated with any  		subgroup of Rider participants. Thus, it appears that Rider participants are  		receiving a higher intensity of service across age groups, TILE classes, rural  		and urban counties, and race/ethnicity groups. This analysis could not,  		however, answer the pressing question of how expenditures for Rider  		participants would compare to the expenditures these clients would have  		incurred had they remained in the nursing facility. </p>
<p><b><i>Discussion</i></b></p>
<p>There are several questions that arise from this study. Most respondents  		identified housing as the constraining factor in the return to the community--a  		constraint that was alleviated to some extent by the use of assisted living.  		Communities with a less well-developed market in assisted living might be less  		able to transition all willing nursing facility residents. Although, housing  		for the elderly and disabled is beyond the scope of the Medicaid program, it  		affects the implementation of initiatives like the Rider that seek to help  		nursing facility residents return to the community. Demand for assisted living  		services might be a reflection of demand for accessible housing rather than  		demand for the full range of CBA program services. </p>
<p>Similarly, we heard reports that the CBA program, and the Rider as a  		means to entering that program, was in demand not for the home and  		community-based services that are at its core, but for the access to unlimited  		prescription drugs that these programs offer as a benefit. Some respondents  		suggested that better prescription drug coverage under Medicaid and Medicare  		could reduce demand for the CBA program to a certain extent. The newly created  		Medicare Part D may serve that function.</p>
<p>There are regional differences in the populations served and the mix of  		services. These differences likely reflect, at least in part, the flexibility  		that the DADS regions are allowed in implementation. The diversity of the DADS  		regions and the variations in implementation show the value of flexibility in  		adapting a state-level policy to local conditions and cultural norms.  		Implementation differences might be a response to local market conditions or  		cultural preferences. Alternatively, the differences might reflect gaps in  		services or culturally inappropriate approaches to service delivery among  		specific populations. Monitoring regional differences could provide one way to  		identify potential problem areas as well as potentially useful innovations.  		</p>
<p>The capacity of the community to respond to the needs of nursing  		facility residents returning to the community has been a recurring theme in  		this study. The Rider initiative is only one component of a broader rebalancing  		of Medicaid long-term care in Texas. The initiative has now been codified  		through regulation, giving it a permanence that should help convince community  		care providers to invest in increased capacity. A closer analysis of the  		service mix by region and county could help identify places where capacity is  		the constraint on additional transitions or on transitions by particular types  		of nursing facility residents. The challenge for states is to seek a balance  		between local flexibility and state support of local structural capacity in  		long-term care systems in order to achieve equal opportunity for independent  		living across different populations at risk of institutionalization.</p>
<h2><a name="append1" id="append1">APPENDIX 1: DATA AND METHODS</a></h2>
<p><b><i>Qualitative Research Methods </i></b></p>
<p>The qualitative component of the research was based on key informant  		interviews at four sites in three DADS regions across the state during April  		and May 2004. Because of our interest in the transition process, we chose sites  		with a high number of transitions, based on data provided by DADS on the number  		of transitions by region and within each region by county. In addition, we  		looked for geographic spread of the chosen regions across the state. Within  		each region, we looked at county demographic characteristics including ethnic  		diversity, income, and home ownership (as a measure of wealth and stability of  		the population). Finally, we looked for a predominantly rural county with a  		relatively high number of transitions that was within a three-hour drive of one  		of the DADS regional headquarters in order to look at potential differences in  		process between rural and urban areas. </p>
<p>Based on these criteria, we chose to visit Ft. Worth in Region 3  		(Tarrant County, north-central Texas), McAllen in Region 11 (Hidalgo County, on  		the Texas-Mexico border near the Gulf coast), and Abilene and the nearby rural  		town, Brownwood, in Region 2 (Taylor County and Brown County, west-central  		Texas).<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note55">55</a></font></sup> Briefly,  		Tarrant County has a predominantly Caucasian population and, relative to the  		statewide average, fewer families with incomes below the federal poverty level,  		fewer individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits, and a  		slightly larger proportion of African-American residents. In contrast, Hidalgo  		County has a strong majority of Hispanic residents, most of whom speak Spanish  		at home. Poverty is more widespread relative to the statewide average, and the  		population is older with a greater prevalence of disability. Taylor and Brown  		Counties are also predominantly Caucasian but with smaller Hispanic and  		African-American minorities than Tarrant or Hidalgo Counties. Brown County is  		predominantly rural, McAllen and Abilene are relatively small urban areas, and  		Ft. Worth is a large urban area, part of the so-called Metroplex of Dallas-Ft.  		Worth. </p>
<p>All of our discussions with key informants at each site were scheduled  		in advance of our visits. We met first with regional DADS officials,  		caseworkers, supervisors, Medicaid eligibility staff, and quality control  		staff. We visited nursing facilities identified by DADS as well as other  		nursing facilities chosen based on the number of transitions, the proportion of  		residents transitioned, and facility characteristics such as ownership status,  		history of deficiencies, and occupancy rate. We made an effort to visit at  		least one nursing facility with a high occupancy rate and one facility with a  		low occupancy rate (relative to other facilities with transitions) at each  		site. At each site, we met with home health providers and other community  		providers, such as ALFs and adult day care, chosen based on information gleaned  		from the literature and from preliminary conversations with advocates and DADS  		officials about the most important types of community providers in the region.  		In each area, we visited with the long-term care ombudsman and representatives  		from the Area Agency on Aging and met with local advocacy groups. Finally, when  		possible, we met with staff at the organizations that were beginning  		implementation of the new statewide relocation contracts. </p>
<p>For each category of key informant with whom we met, we developed a  		standard discussion guide based on a review of the literature and discussions  		with state officials and advocates and designed to elicit both knowledge and  		opinions from a wide range of people involved in the Rider  		initiative.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note56">56</a></font></sup>  		Discussion topics included outreach and education about the Rider initiative  		for staff, nursing facility clients, and nursing facilities; the process to  		transition; procedures for monitoring clients after transition and assuring  		quality of services; administrative procedures and perceived burden;  		characteristics of participating providers; characteristics of participating  		clients; services capacity in the community; and client satisfaction. All  		informants were promised anonymity to encourage them to express their thoughts  		freely. </p>
<p><b><i>Quantitative Research Methods </i></b></p>
<p>In the quantitative analysis, we used data from Texas Medicaid long-term  		care data files to explore how Medicaid recipients who opted to transition to  		the community through the Rider (Rider participants) compared to  		their non-Rider counterparts who remained in nursing facilities (nursing  		facility residents) or who were already receiving services through the  		CBA program (CBA clients).<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note57">57</a></font></sup> We used a cross-section of adult Medicaid  		nursing facility residents as the nursing facility comparison group and all  		non-Rider CBA clients who entered the CBA program while the Rider was in effect  		as the CBA comparison group. </p>
<p>We compare Rider participants to Medicaid nursing facility residents to  		understand which types of residents are likely to transition to community care.  		The Medicaid nursing facility resident population in Texas represents the pool  		of people potentially eligible to use the Rider to gain access to Medicaid  		community-based waiver programs. We compare non-Rider CBA clients to Rider  		participants post-transition in order to understand how Medicaid recipients in  		community care who have not had a nursing facility stay immediately preceding  		entry into CBA differ from those who have. Non-Rider CBA clients represent  		Medicaid recipients who have been determined to be in need of the level of care  		required for nursing facility admission but who receive this care in the  		community without necessarily first going into a nursing facility. Because  		there are only a small handful of Rider participants under the age of 21 and  		because only adults are eligible for the CBA program, we limit our analysis to  		recipients who were age 21 and older. </p>
<p>Depending on the particular research question being addressed, we  		compare Rider participants to nursing facility residents and/or CBA clients  		based on their demographic characteristics, reported medical condition,  		expected level of need for care, and diagnosis. We also compared  		characteristics of the facilities that Rider participants are leaving and  		facilities with no transitions. We examined service mix and recipient status at  		six and twelve months after entry into the CBA program for Rider participants  		and CBA clients. Finally, we looked at costs associated with the provision of  		long-term care to the two community-based care groups. For all analyses, we  		considered estimates at the state level as well as across the ten DADS service  		administration regions and rural and urban counties. We also considered various  		characteristics of transitions to assess if and how the presence of the Rider  		initiative has affected demand for Medicaid long-term care services. </p>
<p><b><i>Comparison Groups</i></b></p>
<p>We developed three analytic samples corresponding to the three  		comparison groups using Medicaid long-term care data provided by Texas  		DADS.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note58">58</a></font></sup> We used  		Medicaid long-term care administrative data on all Rider participants beginning  		in September 2001, when the Rider option became available, and on all CBA  		clients who entered the program between September 2001 and March  		2004.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note59">59</a></font></sup> We used  		Medicaid long-term care administrative data on a cross-section of all adults  		(age 21 or over) residing in nursing facilities in Texas in October 2003 as our  		nursing facility comparison group.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note60">60</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A Rider participant is here defined as a nursing facility resident who  		received authorization to enter the CBA program funded through Medicaid under  		the provisions of the Rider and has received CBA services in the community. We  		identified 5,033 individuals authorized to participate in the Rider initiative.  		Of these, 4,870 had a record of a payment or services under CBA and a confirmed  		nursing facility stay prior to receipt of CBA services and so were included in  		the Rider participant group. We restricted the nursing facility and CBA  		comparison groups to people who were not identified as members of the Rider  		population. For the CBA group, we excluded any clients who had no CBA payment  		data or only had a clinical pre-assessment payment for the CBA program, taking  		into account the possibility of lagged accounting of payment records. The  		nursing facility resident comparison group consisted of 65,132  		individuals<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note61">61</a></font></sup> and the  		CBA comparison group consisted of 15,895 individuals.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note62">62</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b><i>Variables Used in Comparisons </i></b></p>
<p><i>Individual and facility level characteristics</i></p>
<p>For individual level analyses, we used data on age, gender, race and  		ethnicity, urban/rural county of residence, medical diagnosis, and length of  		stay in the facility prior to transition. In addition, we used the TILE class  		as an indicator of the expected level of care dependence.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note63">63</a></font></sup> For the nursing facility-level  		analysis, we looked at both the proportion of facilities from which a Rider  		transition occurred and the number of transitions per facility and compared  		facilities with and without transitions based on ownership status, bed  		certification (Medicaid-only versus mixed certification), size of facility  		(total licensed beds), rural/urban location, and occupancy rates. </p>
<p><i>Service use</i></p>
<p>We compared across samples the proportion of each sample that used any  		amount of each service in the first six months after entry into the CBA  		program. We focus on the first six months on the program for each person as the  		best representation of service use for all recipients since analysis of other  		time periods, specifically, 7-12 months and 13-18 months, are subject to  		greater selection effects due to attrition from the program. We excluded use of  		prescription drugs since all recipients are authorized to receive this benefit  		and because data on prescription drug claims were not available to us. </p>
<p><i>Measures of status after program entry</i></p>
<p>We looked at selected measures of status of Rider participants in  		comparison with those of CBA clients at six and twelve months after CBA entry.  		Our status measures are restricted to the data in the long-term care database,  		which are informative despite being limited in scope. These measures are  		whether, at the end of the period, the recipient was still on the CBA program,  		or in a nursing facility for other than respite care. In some cases, we found  		no evidence of continuing Medicaid long-term care service at the end of a  		period.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note64">64</a></font></sup> Because we  		had limited data on reasons for service termination, we classified these  		clients as having left CBA with unknown status.</p>
<p><i>Costs</i></p>
<p>Our cost analysis focused on the average monthly service cost of  		community-based long-term care for Rider participants and CBA clients over the  		first six months after entry into the CBA program. The analysis includes only  		long-term care costs incurred under the CBA program and excludes prescription  		drugs and all acute care costs, such as hospitalization and physician visits.  		Database structures did not allow us to calculate nursing facility costs with  		sufficient reliability to support research questions on the cost of nursing  		facility care, so analyses of nursing facility costs were not undertaken. We  		present long-term care costs under CBA as an average per person monthly payment  		rate, using data for the six months after entry into CBA, with allowances made  		for lagged billing.<sup><font><a href="examination-texas-rider-37-medicaid-money-follows-person-long-term-care-initiative.html#note65">65</a></font></sup>  		The average payment per month is normalized to a standardized month of 30.46  		days and is adjusted to 2003 reimbursement levels. We also computed average  		monthly program expenditures for Rider participants and CBA clients in the  		aggregate, which differs from our cost calculation in that it takes into  		account both the amount of the service used and the proportion of the group  		that used the service. </p>
<p>We looked at total costs and costs by type of service for the six most  		frequently used services. Medicaid does not finance certain CBA services for  		clients in an ALF since these services are generally included in the assisted  		living service package. Therefore, we calculated cost estimates separately for  		clients in assisted living and those not in assisted living to understand how  		costs and service use differ for these two groups of clients. A client who has  		any payment for an ALF during the six-month period is assumed to be in assisted  		living for the full period.</p>
<h2><a name="append2" id="append2">APPENDIX 2: TILE CLASSES</a></h2>
<p>The Texas Index for Level of Effort, or TILE index, is an index used to  		determine the maximum daily payment rate to providers for a Medicaid recipient  		in Texas. The TILE levels or classes are based on diagnosis, information on  		limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) converted to an ADL score (a  		lower score represents higher functional status), level of care intervention,  		the presence of mental or behavioral conditions that affects care, and receipt  		of rehabilitation services. A full description of each TILE is available at:  		<a href="http://www.dads.state.tx.us/handbooks/mhpm/res/apx06.pdf">http://www.dads.state.tx.us/handbooks/mhpm/res/apx06.pdf</a>. A more detailed  		description of the determination process is available at:  		<a href="http://texinfo.library.unt.edu/texasregister/html/2001/Jul-06/adopted/1.ADMINISTRATION.html">http://texinfo.library.unt.edu/texasregister/html/2001/Jul-06/adopted/1....</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a brief description of each TILE level based on this  		information.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>TILE 211</b> = Clinically stable and ADL score of 3 (lowest  		  reimbursement level). An ADL score of 3 represents the highest level of  		  functional status allowed when meeting Texas criteria for nursing facility  		  admission. In addition, recipients in this class must not meet the criteria for  		  TILE 202 or 210.</p>
<p><b>TILE 210</b> = Clinically stable with mental or behavioral  		  condition affecting care level, and ADL score of 3. The following conditions  		  qualify as meeting this mental/behavioral subgroup: incoherent/frequent  		  disorientation requiring daily intervention; or disruptive or aggressive  		  behavior requiring daily intervention.</p>
<p><b>TILE 209</b> = Clinically stable and ADL score of 4.</p>
<p><b>TILE 208</b> = Clinically unstable and ADL score of 3. To qualify  		  as clinically unstable, the recipient must have one of the following conditions  		  or be receiving one of the following treatments: recent amputation, seizures,  		  dehydration, acute urinary tract infection, incontinence or a Foley catheter,  		  oxygen administration, respiratory therapy, wound dressing for an open  		  wound.</p>
<p><b>TILE 207</b> = Clinically stable and ADL score of 5-6.</p>
<p><b>TILE 206</b> = Clinically unstable and ADL score of 4-6.</p>
<p><b>TILE 205</b> = Clinically stable and ADL score of 7-9.</p>
<p><b>TILE 204</b> = Clinically unstable and ADL score 7-9.</p>
<p><b>TILE 202</b> = A recipient in this class must be receiving  		  restorative nursing care as follow-up to rehabilitation therapy. The  		  rehabilitation therapy must be physical or occupational therapy ordered by a  		  physician and initiated due to a documented event. Therapy must be expected to  		  result in significant, measurable, functional progress. In addition, the  		  recipient must have an ADL score of at least 3.</p>
<p><b>TILE 201 and 203</b> = Requires heavy care, defined as having one  		  of the following conditions or receiving one of the following treatments: coma,  		  quadriplegia, stage III or IV decubitus with care required, non-oral  		  administration of 60 percent or more of nourishment, daily oral or nasal  		  suctioning, daily tracheotomy care or suctioning, excluding self-care. In  		  addition, the recipient must have an ADL score of 6-7 (TILE 203) or 8-9 (TILE  		  201, highest reimbursement level).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Assignment of TILE Class for Each Population</i></b></p>
<p>When a Medicaid recipient enters a nursing facility, Medicaid determines  		the level of reimbursement through a Form 3652 Level of Care assessment. Based  		on this assessment, the recipient is assigned a TILE class, one of 11 payment  		categories. TILE classes are based on medical stability, medical diagnoses, and  		level of dependency, or the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) with  		which a recipient requires assistance. </p>
<p>Determination of TILE class is made when an individual first qualifies  		for Medicaid, and every six months thereafter. Assessments may also be  		conducted when providers observe changes in health status. Thus, each  		individuals payment record includes multiple TILE classes over time. </p>
<p>To compare the Rider sample to the two comparison samples, we used the  		TILE score closest to the Rider samples date of entry into CBA. We also  		examined the TILE scores of the Rider sample assigned at the time Medicaid  		eligibility was first determined (in the nursing facility), to determine if  		TILE scores were significantly different, or provided information on reasons  		for admission (i.e. rehab). Here the significant difference was that the sample  		had a higher proportion classified as rehabilitation (TILE 202) at admission  		and a lower proportion with TILE 211 relative to relative to the TILE classes  		at CBA entry. </p>
<p>Protocols used to search the data and obtain a TILE class for each  		individual.</p>
<p><i>Rider Sample</i></p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to get a TILE score for each observation  		in the Rider Sample as near as possible to the Rider Start Date but before  		entry into the CBA program. For each observation a TILE score was taken from  		the Tex10b_LevelDataforCBAClnt database starting from the Rider Start Date and  		moving backwards in time. This exercise resulted in 695 missing cases (14  		percent of the sample). </p>
<p>In order to reduce the number of missing cases, TILE scores were then  		taken from the same database from the Rider Start Date moving forward in time  		three days. Unfortunately, this method only reduced the number of missing cases  		by one observation. Next, given the likelihood that an observations TILE  		score did not change dramatically over short time periods, on the same database  		the nursing facility begin date was used going forward in time to extract a  		TILE score. This method also reduced the number of missing cases by only one  		observation. Finally, the Medicaid Long-Term Care Payment Database was used to  		extract a TILE score using the nursing facility begin date and moving forward  		in time. This method successfully reduced the number of missing cases by 444  		observations. The final number of missing cases was 295 observations or  		approximately 5 percent of the sample. </p>
<p><i>CBA Sample</i></p>
<p>For the CBA Sample, the goal was to obtain a TILE score as near as  		possible to the CBA Start Date. Using the Tex10B_LevelDataforCBAClnt database,  		the CBA Start Date was used moving backwards in time to extract a TILE score.  		This method was quite successful resulting in only 923 missing cases (or nearly  		6 percent of the sample). </p>
<p>In order to further reduce the number of missing cases, the same  		database was used going forward in time from the CBA Start Date, once again  		assuming that TILE scores do not change dramatically over short time periods.  		This method reduced the number of missing cases to 886 observations (or  		approximately 5.5 percent of the sample). </p>
<p><i>Nursing Facility Sample</i></p>
<p>The most recent available TILE score was extracted for the Nursing  		Facility Sample using the Medicaid Long-Term Care Payment Database. Only 460  		cases were missing using this method (less than 1 percent of the sample). </p>

<p><a name="note37" id="note37">According</a> to the Texas Administrative Code  			 Title 40, Chapter 82, the state defines an assisted living facility as an  			 establishment that provides food, shelter, and personal care services to four  			 or more unrelated persons in one or more facilities. The statutory rules state  			 that the service philosophy of assisted living emphasizes personal dignity,  			 autonomy, independence, and privacy and allows for resident's to age in place  			 while receiving services according to level of need. In Texas, only licensed  			 facilities may use the term assisted living. Assisted living services are  			 covered by the state's Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services waiver  			 program in licensed assisted living facilities (Mollica R. 2002. <i>State  			 Assisted Living Policy: 2002</i>. National Academy of State Health Policy.  			 Portland, Maine).</p>

<p><a name="note39" id="note39">Our</a> analysis of service mix does not include  			 estimation of the intensity of services received, only the share of recipients  			 receiving each service. Data available on the number of service units received  			 was not adequate to conduct such an analysis. Instead, we rely on an analysis  			 of average monthly costs among users of each service to determine relative  			 intensity of services between Rider participants and CBA clients. This cost  			 analysis is presented below. We present findings here on service use in the  			 first six months after program entry. We also considered other time periods but  			 found little difference between these periods and the first six months. For  			 ease of exposition, we here present findings for the first six months  			 only.</p>

<p><a name="note41" id="note41">Adaptive</a> aids include durable medical  			 equipment, such as beds and wheelchairs, and some aids not covered under  			 traditional Medicaid, such as seeing-eye dogs.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note45" id="note45">A</a> significant limitation of the data available  			 to assess recipient status is that it is likely to underreport mortality, with  			 some share of those with unknown status actually having died. In our assessment  			 based on discussions with state officials familiar with the data and the  			 populations served, the following circumstances are most likely to be  			 associated with assignment of unknown status: (1) hospitalization, which is not  			 included in the long-term care files; (2) death, which may not always be  			 recorded in the data files; and (3) moved out of state. It is also possible  			 that recipient health improved to a degree that left them medically ineligible  			 for the CBA program, although our site visit informants suggested that  			 termination for medical ineligibility rarely happens. With the available data,  			 we have no means to assess the relative impact of each of these  			 factors.</p>

<li>
<p><a name="note49" id="note49">We</a> use data from the first six months after  			 entry into the CBA program to estimate average monthly service costs for each  			 Rider participant and CBA client by service. We then consider the cost per  			 recipient for the complete set of services paid for by the CBA program for each  			 population. This total cost calculation allows us to estimate the overall  			 average monthly Medicaid CBA program expenditures for recipients in both groups  			 in the first six months of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note50" id="note50">First,</a> we found that Rider participants and CBA  			 clients differ somewhat in the timing of their entry into assisted living in  			 the six-month analysis period. Among Rider participants classed as ALF users,  			 95 percent had reported payments for assisted living in the first month after  			 CBA entry, compared with 83 percent among CBA clients (data not shown). There  			 are also differences in the share of each group continuing to reside in ALFs  			 over the study period. The share with assisted living payments drops from 95 to  			 83 percent in the sixth month after CBA entry for Rider participants but  			 remains stable at 83 percent among CBA clients (data not shown). The decline in  			 ALF use over time among Rider participants supports the notion expressed by  			 caseworkers in the site visits that assisted living could serve as a bridge  			 from the nursing facility to more integrated community living. A longitudinal  			 analysis of the living situation of Rider participants would be necessary to  			 test this hypothesis.</p>

<p><a name="note57" id="note57">For</a> ease of exposition, we generally refer to  			 non-Rider CBA clients simply as CBA clients and to CBA clients who entered the  			 program via the Rider as Rider participants, recognizing that Rider  			 participants are also CBA clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note58" id="note58">These</a> three groups are described briefly here.  			 A detailed account of how each sample was constructed is provided in Sommers et  			 al. 2005. Both the Rider and the CBA groups described here constitute  			 populations, and the group sizes are large. As a result, all but the smallest  			 differences between groups will likely be statistically significant. Therefore,  			 we recommend that policy-makers look for differences that are large enough to  			 have policy relevance rather than those that meet the test of statistical  			 significance. For this reason, we do not note statistically significant  			 differences in this report.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a name="note62" id="note62">The</a> size of each comparison group can vary  			 depending on the analysis in question. For example, some analyses look at  			 differences in service use after six and twelve months on the program and so  			 include only those individuals who had been in the program for at least that  			 length of time. Other analyses require similar adjustments in the comparison  			 group.</p>

<li>
<p><a name="note64" id="note64">There</a> are many possible reasons for  			 discontinuation of services. Hospitalizations are not recorded in the databases  			 we used; therefore, if the client was hospitalized and died in the hospital,  			 the death would not be reported in the long-term care Medicaid database.  			 Alternatively, the client might have been found ineligible for Medicaid  			 services at redetermination, might have become ineligible because his or her  			 health improved and he or she no longer met the medical necessity criterion for  			 program participation, or moved out of state, or did not make any required  			 financial contribution, or behavioral issues made him or her unsuited for the  			 program.</p>
