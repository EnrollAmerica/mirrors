<h1><a name="_Toc335834550" id="_Toc335834550">Introduction</a></h1>
</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Currently in the U.S., chronic conditions—including diseases  such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes—are responsible for 7 of 10  deaths among Americans each year and account for 75 percent of the nation’s  health spending (HHS, 2010). The growing prevalence of  chronic diseases is taking a toll not only on the health status of the U.S.  population but also constitutes an economic burden borne by individuals and  families, employers, and government programs. The growth in both the prevalence  and spending on chronic diseases in the U.S. population triggered an increased  appreciation of the potential for preventive services, both clinical and  population- or community-based, as important strategies to delay or avoid the  development or progression of harmful and costly conditions.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In response to the increasing  prevalence and costs associated with chronic disease, the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act (ACA) places renewed effort on coordinating and  improving access to prevention services. Under Section 2713, the ACA requires non-grandfathered  private health plans to cover, without cost-sharing, a select set of clinical  preventive services—those with an A or B rating by the U.S. Preventive Services  Task Force (USPSTF); routine immunizations recommended by Advisory Committee on  Immunization Practices (ACIP); and evidence-based preventive care and  screenings for infants, children, adolescents, and women included in Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) guidelines (HHS, n.d.). As of  August 1, 2011, under the ACA, HHS requires coverage of specific preventive  care for women’s health screenings without cost-sharing (e.g., well-woman  visits, prescription contraception, and breastfeeding support) (HHS, 2011). The  ACA provides for grants to states to provide incentives to Medicaid  beneficiaries for behavioral changes that prevent the development of chronic  diseases and to small businesses for workplace wellness programs. It expands  the coverage of preventive services in Medicare and Medicaid and provides for  investments in recommended community preventive services with grants to state,  territorial, and local public health agencies. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">These recent policy  changes affecting privately sponsored and governmental health care and also public  health programs have broadened the salience and applications of economic models  of preventive services and interventions, and call for an examination of such  models in the current policy context. Although investments in community  prevention holds the potential for a strong return on investment in both  clinical and economic terms, existing models may not tell a consistent and  comparable story in terms of which investments will yield savings and provide  the most value to society in the short- and long-term. Hence, evaluating the  state of the art in prevention modeling and advancing the field of future  prevention models—in scientific grounding, analytic rigor and policy  relevance—is a high priority. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">This paper reviews a  broad variety of approaches to estimating the health and economic impacts of  preventive health services and prevention programs and policy interventions,  and considers their usefulness to public and private sector decision makers in  health services coverage and financing policy and public health. Building on  Weinstein and colleagues (2003), w<span>e consider an economic  evaluation model for preventive interventions as any analytic methodology that accounts  for events over time and across populations, that is based on primary or  secondary data, and with the aim of estimating the effects of an intervention  on valued health and other societal consequences and costs. Models are valuable  not only because of their results, which depend on their inputs, both data and  assumptions, but also because the construction of a model, regardless of the  framework, helps to answer these basic policy questions: Do we know enough to  act and, if not, what do we need better information about?</span></p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The paper is organized  as follows: </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>The first section provides an overview of basic analytic  approaches to the economic impact of preventive interventions: burden of  disease or cost-of-illness (CoI) analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA),  benefit-cost analysis (BCA), return on investment (RoI), and actuarial analysis.  </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>The second section discusses the range of approaches for valuing  health outcomes, including practices in BCA, which quantify states of health in  monetary terms in order to assess overall welfare, and those in CEA, which uses  either natural units (e.g., cases of illness avoided or life years extended) or  synthetic units that combine information on morbidity and mortality impacts (e.g.,  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)).</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>The third section considers issues in estimation methods and the advantages  and drawbacks of alternative approaches.  </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>       </span></span>The  fourth section presents methodological best practice standards promulgated by  public sector or academic consortia and professional bodies in the U.S. and by  selected international groups.<span>P0F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></a></p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>The fifth section presents examples of different types of  analyses, discusses the valuation and estimation choices used, and demonstrates  how the framework derived from the categories considered in the previous  section can be used to summarize and assess the outputs of models and studies  encountered in academic literature and in commercial and public sector analyses  and policy documents. The earlier sections use examples included in the tables  of Section 5 to illustrate points relevant to the topic under discussion.</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>The final section suggests possible implications of this review  and analysis of prevention modeling for ASPE’s research and analytic agenda and  formulates questions to be addressed by an expert panel on economic modeling of  prevention benefits, which was convened at NORC offices in Bethesda, MD, on  April 17, 2012.      </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Economic evaluation of the  impact of disease and of health interventions has developed and matured over  the past fifty years, tracking advances in epidemiological and clinical  research methods, economic theory, and computational capacities. In addition,  theoretical and methodological advances, along with empirical resources and  knowledge, are increasingly being shared internationally. Today best practices  in reporting economic analyses and innovations in model designs can have global  reach. This section briefly outlines the development of economic evaluation in  health, with particular attention to their applications in the analysis of  preventive interventions. It covers five analytic frameworks: cost-of-illness;  cost-effectiveness; benefit-cost; return-on-investment; and actuarial. These  frameworks are not entirely exclusive of each other, and share many components  and estimation practices. Nevertheless, distinguishing studies or models by  these categories is helpful in terms of signaling what we can expect to learn  from the particular analysis. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Calculating the  economic consequences of disease: Cost of illness analysis.</i></b> One of the  initial efforts to estimate the national cost impacts of a specific disease was  the cost-of-illness (CoI) approach initially formulated by Dorothy Rice and colleagues  in the 1960s (Rice, 1966; Rice and Cooper, 1967; Cooper and Rice, 1976; Rice et  al., 1985). CoI analyses include the <i>direct costs</i> of illness (medical  care, travel costs) and <i>indirect costs</i> (the value of lost productivity).  Experiential aspects of illness such as pain and suffering were deemed <i>intangible</i>  costs, and not incorporated into CoI.  CoI calculations for chronic diseases  are typically based on prevalence, not incidence, and estimated for an annual  cohort of the population. The sum of direct and indirect costs represents the  overall CoI on society, which can be expressed as a percentage of that year’s  gross domestic product (GDP).  Although the direct costs calculated in CoI  represent those incurred in a single time period (one year), the productivity losses  due to illness, disability or premature death are measured as the present value  of a future stream of earnings, so the CoI approach is not conceptually  straightforward. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">When CoI studies were  first introduced—and still today—they served to address policymakers’ need for  information about the relative economic importance of different diseases in  order to establish policy priorities. Studies that examine direct medical costs  alone are also used to apportion shares of those costs among different payers.  Finkelstein and colleagues (2009), for example, have conducted an analysis that  produced estimates of annual medical spending attributable to obesity by  insurance category: Medicare, Medicaid, and private coverage. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Alternatives to the static and possibly biased<span>P1F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"><span><sup>[2]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> estimates  that CoI produces have emerged relatively recently. In particular, in 2009 the  World Health Organization (WHO) issued the <i>WHO Guide to Identifying the  Economic Consequences of Disease and Injury</i>, which reviews and critiques a  range of approaches to assessing the economic impact of ill health. The WHO  guide considers studies conducted from the perspective of households, firms and  governments (described as microeconomic), and those addressing the aggregate  impact of a disease on GDP or national economic growth (the macroeconomic  level)<i>. </i>The guide was developed to address the heterogeneity and  conceptual deficiencies in methods for estimating the economic burden of  illness, and proposes “a defined conceptual framework within which the economic  impact of disease or injury can be considered and appropriately estimated… (p.  2-3).” Although the authors of the WHO guide carefully distinguish their focus  from modeling and analysis to inform the allocation of resources among a range  of possible interventions through cost-effectiveness or benefit–cost analysis,  many of the data needs and steps in model construction are common to all of  these approaches.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Cost-effectiveness  analysis (CEA). </i></b>CEA is the leading analytic framework for the economic evaluation  of health policies and interventions, outside of federal policy making. Based  on many of the same principles as benefit–cost analysis (discussed next), CEA provides  decision makers with information about the relative costs of different  strategies or interventions to achieve a standardized measure of benefit.  CEA  can be used to inform the allocation of a fixed budget across health-improving  interventions and services.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">CEA can account for the  desirable effects of a health intervention in terms of natural units such as cases  of disease averted or years of life gained, or in terms of synthetic measures  that combine effects on morbidity and mortality such as health-adjusted life  years (HALYs—the general term for metrics such as quality-adjusted life years, QALYs,  and disability-adjusted life years, DALYs). In CEA, the costs of each option  are divided by the effect measure to determine the cost per “unit” of benefit  provided.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Because CEA produces a  ratio, a consistent definition of what counts as a cost in contrast to what  counts as an effect is important for comparability across analyses. In 1993 the  U.S. Public Health Service established an expert committee, the Panel on  Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (PCEHM), to improve the quality and  comparability of CEAs used in health policy and medical decision making by  recommending best practices. In its 1996 report (Gold et al.) the PCEHM made recommendations  for measuring and distinguishing between costs and benefits. The PCEHM codified  their recommended best practices as a <i>reference case</i>—taking a societal  perspective—that all health-related CEAs should present, in addition to  presenting any other analyses (e.g., from the perspective of a particular  payer.)</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">PCEHM recommends that,  in the reference case, costs include changes in the use of health care  resources, treatment-related changes in the use of non-health care resources,  changes in the use of informal caregiver time, and changes in the use of  patient time due to treatment, defining these elements of cost as follows (Gold  et al., 1996, p. 179–181):</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Direct health care costs include those associated with medical  services such as the provision of supplies (including pharmaceuticals) and  facilities as well as personnel salaries and benefits.</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Direct non-health care costs include nonmedical resources used to  support the intervention, for example, the costs of child care while a parent  is undergoing treatment or of transportation to and from a medical facility.</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Informal caregiver time reflects the unpaid time spent by family  members or volunteers in providing home care. (Paid time for nursing and other  medical care is included as direct health care costs.)</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Patient time involves the time spent in treatment, but not other  changes in use of time attributable to the health condition. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">This  last instruction, which excludes lost productivity due to illness in the  reference case to avoid double counting,  has remained controversial among  practitioners of CEA. The authors of the U.S. PCEHM recommendations argued that  the health-related quality of life measure should (at least implicitly) capture  the impact of illness on usual activities such as work and leisure (Weinstein  et al., 1996). However, some CEA practitioners do not believe that such impacts  are reflected in the relative values people assign to different health states  in the preference elicitation studies that underlie QALYs. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Within the past decade,  the WHO has developed an approach to CEA that allows the decision maker to  identify and rank a range of interventions along a health-maximizing dimension,  for any given budget. The WHO’s <i>generalized </i>approach aims to inform  priorities for resource allocation across a broad spectrum of health and social  programs (Baltussen et al., 2003<i>)</i>. The WHO-CHOICE initiative, under  which the standards for generalized cost-effectiveness analysis have been  developed, intends to “generate comparable databases of intervention cost  effectiveness for all leading contributors to disease burden in a number of  world regions” enabling “the efficiency of current practice to be evaluated at  the same time as the efficiency of new interventions (should additional  resources become available)” (Chisholm and Evans, 2007, p. 331-332).  In <i>generalized  CEA </i>the cost-effectiveness of all options, including currently funded  interventions, is compared—unconstrained by the current mix of interventions.  Importantly, the numerator reflects gross—not net—costs, as in standard CEA (Balthussen  et al., 2003). The WHO-CHOICE initiative also seeks to offer an international  standard for the conduct of CEA so that the results of individual analyses conducted  in one site or economy can be more widely used. See Table 3 in Section 4 for  more details on this framework.            </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i><span>Benefit–cost analysis (BCA).</span></i></b><span> </span>BCA is a framework for evaluating the effects  of public policy choices on social welfare. First employed in the United States  early in the twentieth century to assess federal projects such as canals and  dams, BCA gained broader application in the 1960s, initially as part of the  Defense Department’s Planning, Programming and Budgeting System. In 1981,  President Reagan issued an executive order (E. O. 12291) that directed federal  agencies to conduct Regulatory Impact Analyses for major initiatives, including  an assessment of costs and benefits (Zerbe et al., 2010).  In 2003, the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Circular A-4, which established detailed  methods for identifying the benefits and costs of proposed regulatory actions,  including health impacts, and standards for what agencies should include in a  BCA (OMB, 2003). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">BCA compares the  positive effects of policy actions, such as preventing illness and death by  reducing the emission of air pollutants, with the costs associated with  achieving these positive results. In BCA, both benefits and costs are  calculated at the societal level and measured in monetary terms. The <i>net  benefits </i>of alternative policy options, calculated as the difference in the  total benefits and total costs of each option, can be compared to determine  which intervention (if any) will maximize social welfare. The <i>benefit­-cost  ratio </i>can also be reported. This ratio is sometimes characterized as the  societal return on investment. Because information about the magnitude of  benefits and costs is factored out of the ratio, it is important to report the  net benefits of a BCA.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">BCA attempts to  identify the efficient use of economic resources across a society. Welfare  economics serves as the conceptual foundation for BCA. In the normative  framework of welfare economics, social welfare (or well-being) is construed as  the sum of all individuals’ personal welfare or <i>utility</i>, which is  defined as the satisfaction of individual preferences.  Because utility cannot  be measured directly, marketplace transactions are used to determine the  utility of goods traded in markets and, for non-market benefits such as  improvements in health or reductions in mortality risk, analysts use estimates  of individual <i>willingness to pay </i>(WTP) or similar measures to determine  their value. (See Section 2 for further discussion of WTP.) </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In the public health  field (where analysts still refer to “cost−benefit analysis (CBA)”)  typically health outcomes are monetized as the indirect costs of illness. See “Reevaluating  the Benefits of Folic Acid Fortification in the United States: Economic  Analysis, Regulation, and Public Health” (Grosse et al., 2005) for a discussion  and comparison of CEA and CBA results. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Return-on-Investment  (RoI) analysis.</i></b>  RoI analysis is a form of cost analysis that typically  addresses the financial consequences of an intervention from the standpoint of  a particular payer, such as employer. RoI is expressed as a ratio of profits  (or cost savings) for a given enterprise within a certain period divided by  dollars invested during that same period to achieve that level of profit or  cost savings. In the case of a prevention intervention that provides a worksite  program to encourage physical activity, the costs of facilitating increased  physical activity by investments such as subsidizing gym memberships,  installing and maintaining onsite exercise equipment, organizing group walks, or  promoting personal daily walking goals would be compared to the difference  between actual and predicted medical claims payments for either all or some (presumably  related) health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), and between  actual and predicted absenteeism costs. To encompass the experience over  multiple years, present values for costs and savings in annual periods  following the base year would be discounted.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Trogdon and colleagues  (2009) have developed a simulation model to calculate RoI for workplace  interventions to reduce obesity, based on previous cost-of-illness studies  (Finkelstein et al., 2003; 2005). This model, published as a toolkit or  calculator by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), estimates  the incremental direct medical costs and value of increased absenteeism  attributable to obesity using data for specific firms. In a second module, the  model calculates an estimated RoI for several interventions to reduce obesity,  also using firm-specific information about total or per capita costs of the  firm’s intervention (CDC, 2011b). Notable features of the model include using  incremental units of Body Mass Index (BMI) rather than broad BMI categories to  capture the impact of small changes; distinguishing short and longer term  effectiveness by separately calculating the first and subsequent year weight  losses from baseline (assuming some regression to baseline after the first  year); and allowing for first-year or capital investment costs to be input  separately from subsequent year operating costs.  The model assumes a stable  workforce and thus does not account for employee turnover.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Actuarial  analysis</i>.</b> Actuarial analysis of the financial impact of health  interventions employs epidemiological and statistical data and methods (e.g.,  life tables) to project future spending over a defined set of programs for a  given population using information about expenditures within those programs for  comparable populations in previous and current periods. Actuarial analysis can  vary widely in scope depending on program or system involved. For example, the  financial implications of adding a preventive service as a covered benefit in a  private health insurance plan would likely be limited to the impact on overall  health services expenditures for the insured population, while the analysis of  the same service conducted by federal actuaries for the Medicare program could  include the impact not only on Medicare expenditures but also on Social  Security tax revenues and payments as a result of projected changes in labor  force participation and longevity. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">As discussed further in  Section 1.2, information from economic analyses that do make behavioral  assumptions, including simulation models, are employed by federal actuaries who  project the future costs of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as they are by  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysts. Thus the kinds of information that  actuaries make use of in their projections of program and legislative proposal  costs are more varied than the technical discipline of actuarial science might  suggest.</p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The review of different  forms of economic analyses in the previous section alluded to a number of their  policy applications. This section itemizes and considers their various and  particular uses, including professional recommendations for clinical practice,  public and private insurance plan benefit and public programming decisions,  regulatory impact assessment, and program and legislative cost estimation. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Clinical practice  guidelines.</i></b> Medical professional organizations and public groups such  as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) take economic  evaluations, typically in the form of CEAs or systematic reviews of economic  studies, into account when recommending that clinicians offer specific preventive  interventions to their patients. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Insurance benefits  and programming</i>.</b> The ACIP also determines, in a separate process, which  vaccines are included in the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which  finances vaccines for children who are Medicaid-eligible, uninsured or  underinsured, or who are American Indians or Alaska natives—in total, almost  half of U.S. children (Kim, 2011). Economic analyses of clinical preventive  services and community-based preventive interventions are used by private  insurance plans and employers to make decisions about covered benefits or  investments in workplace prevention initiatives. Public health and other  governmental agencies at all levels consider the recommendations of the Task  Force on Community Preventive Services, which requires systematic reviews of  economic studies for any community-based intervention that it evaluates, in program  design and funding decisions. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The National Commission  on Prevention Priorities (NCPP), established under the auspices of the private,  nonprofit coalition of businesses, periodically issues a rating of clinical  preventive services recommended by either ACIP or USPSTF that considers not  only population health impact and strength of evidence (the basis of the  service’s USPSTF rating), but also the service’s cost-effectiveness (Maciosek  et al., 2009). These ratings aim to inform private health insurance plans as  they make decisions about which of many clinically recommended services to  include as a covered benefit.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Regulatory impact  analysis.</i></b><i> </i>As previously noted, by executive order<i> </i>federal  agencies must estimate the expected benefits and costs of proposed major  regulations in an integrated analysis, and publish this impact assessment along  with the proposed rule (E.O. 12291). Historically federal agencies tended to  conduct BCAs, and guidelines for regulatory analysis focused on BCA. Since  2003, however, OMB Circular A-4 has instructed agencies issuing health and  safety regulations to include both a BCA and a CEA whenever feasible. The  guidance also requires an assessment of how the impacts are distributed across  relevant demographic and geographic subgroups. Federal agencies as diverse as  the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the  Departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and the Department of Labor’s Occupational  Safety and Health Administration have developed distinctive approaches to  conducting BCAs and CEAs to comply with the requirement for regulatory impact analysis  (Miller et al., eds., 2006).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Federal program  and legislative cost estimates.</i></b><i> </i>The Office of the Actuary (OACT)  in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) conducts actuarial,  economic, and demographic studies to estimate Medicare and Medicaid program  expenditures under current law and under proposed legislation. OACT addresses  issues regarding the financing of current and future health programs and evaluates  operations of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical  Insurance Trust Funds. OACT also conducts microanalyses to assess the impact of  various health care financing factors on federal program costs and estimates  the financial effects of national or incremental health insurance reforms,  including changes in covered benefits. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">When OACT considers the  financial impact on federal programs of, for example, an intervention to  improve the health outcomes of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes through  more intensive disease management, they examine both annual and lifetime total  medical costs borne by the program, and the time at which those changes in  spending occur. The likely impact of the intervention is considered in the  context of concurrent trends in disease incidence, prevalence and severity, and  in care practices that might also affect the costs of medical care for persons  with diabetes. CMS actuaries also consider the impact on tax revenues and  Social Security retirement and disability benefits when evaluating a proposed  intervention’s impact on longevity and health status.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The Congressional  Budget Office (CBO) provides the Congress with objective and nonpartisan  analysis for economic and budgetary decisions, including information and  estimates required by the Congressional budgetary process. CBO projects  current-law federal spending and revenues, the federal budgetary effects of  proposed legislation, and the economic and budgetary effects of policy  alternatives. CBO typically projects costs within a 10-year budget “window.” CBO  also forecasts budgetary effects for more than 10 years, as with the ACA, for  which estimates spanned a 20-year period. However, for projections greater than  the traditional ten-year period, the results are report as a percentage of GDP,  not the traditional federal budget expenditures measured in millions or  billions of dollars per year.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">CBO also reports  whether a proposal is expected to increase the federal deficit by more than $5  billion in the subsequent four 10-year periods and produces a Long Term Budget  Outlook report, which most recently (June 2011) projected federal spending for  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies, among other  programs, to 2035, with 75-year projections in the Appendix. These longer term  budget projections, unlike 10-year projections, are reported as a share of GDP  rather than in nominal dollars. As relevant, CBO also estimates the impacts of  legislative proposals on State and local budgets, GDP and employment,  distributional effects, and health insurance coverage and premiums (Kling,  2011).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In its economic  simulation models to project the impact of legislative changes, CBO uses the  most likely assumptions about the behavioral responses of households,  businesses, federal regulators, and other levels of government. In addition to  reviewing historical data for federal programs, data available from state  programs, and conducting its own research with administrative records and  survey data, CBO reviews studies conducted by others, and consults with  researchers, agency officials, and businesses and interest groups. The most  persuasive studies are: </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Critical reviews of the literature that assess the strength of  evidence; </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Experiments and demonstrations with random assignment that  address causal mechanisms; and </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Linked administrative and survey data to assess behavioral  responses and socio-demographic impacts of policy changes. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">CBO  consults with formal panels of economic and health advisors, and studies and reports  are reviewed by outside experts.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>State legislative  cost estimates. </i></b>The Washington State Institute for Public Policy  (WSIPP) is a non-partisan legislative research unit that has developed a method  for prospectively estimating the costs and benefits of proposed legislative  policies for the State.  They use a benefit-cost framework for their analyses,  to include estimates of impacts to society as a whole, including taxpayers,  those individuals directly impacted by a policy, and other people in society indirectly  impacted by a policy. WSIPP describes their research approach as follows.  First, determine what works and what does not; what is efficient; what is the  risk to the state in implementing individual policy options; and what  interventions might be implemented together in a “portfolio” to achieve a  common goal (WSIPP, 2012). WSIPP analysts begin by researching existing  literature and meta-analyzing results to compute an effect size for a given  intervention. Next, they examine costs and benefits from a societal  perspective, considering the financial impacts on various parties in Washington  State. The third step is a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis of the estimated  net benefits. WSIPP analysts present legislative decision makers with a  graphical display of the likelihood that the net benefits of a policy will be  greater than zero under a variety of assumptions. For example, Figure 1  displays the distribution of potential outcomes for a given policy option,  demonstrating that, given the model assumptions employed, the likelihood of a  positive net benefit from the policy (measured as net present value), is 75%. </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In addition to these  standard analytic frameworks for economic evaluation of preventive  interventions, we review and consider models that depart from these standard  approaches that have had some purchase in policy discussions of the financing  of both clinical and community-based prevention. Several years ago, in the  context of policy debates leading up to the passage of ACA, several  organizations and consortia independently developed multiple-disease,  multiple-intervention models to estimate the potential for reducing disease  burden and health care (and in some cases other) costs through new investments  in clinical and community-based preventive measures. Here we review the most  prominent of these analyses: Milken Institute’s study, <i>An Unhealthy America:  The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease, Charting a New Course</i> (DeVol et  al., 2007)<i>; </i>the Urban Institute’s return-on-investment model for Trust  for America’s Health and the California Endowment (TFAH, 2008); and the prevention  module of The Lewin Group’s analysis of the Commonwealth Fund’s health reform  proposal (The Lewin Group, 2009). In addition, we discuss Archimedes, a  simulation model that addresses clinical, administrative, and financial outcomes  for a wide range of conditions with integrated physiology and care-process  models (Schlessinger and Eddy, 2002).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Milken Institute.</i></b><i> </i>In an exercise to highlight the  economic impact of increasing rates of chronic disease, the Milken Institute  constructed a simulation model to project 20-year economic outcomes (2003-2023)  for the U.S. population, both overall and for each state individually (DeVol, Bedroussian  et al., 2007). The simulations are based on:</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>components that reflect demographic changes over the period;</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>       </span></span>a  pooled cross-sectional analysis of the relationships between behavioral risk  factors and seven specific chronic diseases<span>P2F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><span><sup>[3]</sup></span></a><span>P</span>; and </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>a model depicting a scenario in which preventive interventions  result in lower rates of disease. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The  simulation projects, for “baseline” and “optimistic” scenarios, the economic  burden of chronic diseases in terms of direct medical care costs, indirect  costs of lost workdays and lower employee productivity, and forgone national  economic growth (measured as inflation-adjusted GDP) and intergenerational  effects (measured as the educational attainment of the children of workers as a  function of health and consequently income). The model does not take into  account the costs of implementing any of the preventive strategies that are  assumed to lead to lower rates of preventable chronic diseases. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The optimistic scenario  includes assumptions of improved diet and physical activity, leading to  reductions in obesity rates and consequently lower rates of several diseases;  continued reductions in rates of smoking, lower rates of increase in air  pollution, and improved early cancer detection through screening. A standard  macroeconomic model simulates the impact of health on GDP, with life expectancy  at age 65 serving as a proxy for health. The model assumes that health affects  investments both in education and physical capital, with dynamic feedback  between health and educational attainment over generations. Data on disease  prevalence and costs of care are from the 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey  (MEPS), and other parameters on are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau,  the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and the National Health  Interview Survey (NHIS).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The model’s baseline  simulation, assuming current trends continue, projects a 42 percent increase in  cases of the seven chronic diseases by 2023, with an incremental cost of $4.2  trillion for medical care and lost economic output. The optimistic scenario,  compared with the baseline scenario, would decrease treatment costs by $218  billion and decrease productivity losses by $905 billion, thus reducing the  economic impact of disease by 27 percent, or $1.1 trillion in 2023. The model’s  results are greatly dependent on the productivity component. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Days lost from work  come from the NHIS, and are imputed to various chronic diseases. The value of  each day lost from work was based on national estimates of GDP per employee.  The costs of lost productivity while at work (presenteeism) were assumed to be  17 times as high as the costs due to absenteeism, based on a 2004 study by  Goetzel and colleagues. Applying this large multiplier to days lost from work  (for productivity losses due to presenteeism) and the use of the average wage  rate per employee to calculate the value of lost productivity account for more  than 80 percent of the estimated economic gains from preventing disease.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Urban Institute.</i></b><i>  </i>In collaboration with the Prevention Institute, the New York Academy of  Medicine, and with support from the California Endowment, the Urban Institute  developed an economic model of the potential impact in the U.S. of primary  prevention interventions at the community level to address nutrition, physical  activity, and smoking (Levi et al., 2008; Ormand et al., 2011; Prevention  Institute et al., 2007).  The return-on-investment (RoI) model relied on a  literature review of selected studies, 1975-2008, that reported on  community-based public health programs aimed at improving health or changing  behaviors affecting health. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Expensive diseases  determined to be affected by these behaviors—diabetes, high blood pressure,  kidney disease, stroke, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, and chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—were grouped into three broad categories  according to the time frames in which community interventions could be expected  to have an impact. For uncomplicated diabetes and/or high blood pressure, an  impact on disease prevalence and costs could be expected within 1-2 years; for  the same conditions <i>with complications </i>(heart disease, kidney disease,  and/or stroke), prevalence could be expected to be affected within 5 years; for  selected cancers, arthritis, and COPD, public health interventions were assumed  to reduce prevalence in 10-20 years. Based on the literature review results,  prevalence rates for the short-term and 5-year disease groups were modeled as  achieving a one-time reduction of 5 percent; rates for the conditions  developing over the long term, cancer, arthritis and COPD, were assumed to be  reduced by 2.5 percent. The intervention was assumed to be ongoing for the  course of the model period. The authors did not assume any diminution from the  effectiveness achieved in the first year and noted that they also did not build  in additional positive impacts (reductions in disease rates) in years  subsequent to the first. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The share of medical costs attributable to each of the  diseases in the model was derived from a regression analysis of Medical  Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), 2003-2005, so was limited to the population of  non-institutionalized adults. Medical savings calculations were calculated as  the product of the share of costs attributable to the three groupings of  diseases (described above), total health care expenditures, and the assumed  impact of community interventions on disease prevalence. The cost of the  interventions was conservatively estimated at $10 per capita, across the entire  population, based on reported costs in studies of community interventions that  mostly ran from $3 to $8, and after consultation with experts about the $10  assumption. This represents <i>marginal costs </i>of the interventions only,  however. The model also assumes a steady-state population, given disease  prevalence for the included conditions as of 2004.  It does not take account of  any changes in mortality, or competing morbidity risks. Productivity impacts  are not included in the analysis. At the national level, a $10 per capita  expenditure on community prevention is estimated to save $2.8 billion in 1 to 2  years; $16.5 billion within 5 years, and $18 billion in 10 to 20 years, over  what health expenditures for the affected diseases would otherwise have cost at  2004 prevalence rates.<span>P3F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"><span><sup>[4]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> The reported  ROI is 2:1 in the short term and roughly 6:1 over both the medium and long  term. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Unlike the Milken  study, the Urban Institute model did not project forward current disease  prevalence trends. However, it also focused exclusively on medical expenditure  impacts, and projected increases in medical spending using CMS projections.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>The Lewin Group  “Path” proposal estimates.</i></b><i> </i>In 2009, The Lewin Group developed  estimates of the cost impacts of provisions included in the Commonwealth Fund’s  health reform proposal, “Path to a High-Performance Health Care System,” based  on Lewin’s Health Benefits Simulation Model (HBSM) (The Lewin Group, 2009). The  HBSM is a microsimulation model designed, in its baseline scenario, to  represent the distribution of health insurance coverage and spending for a  representative sample of U.S. households in 2010, using MEPS data 2002–2005.  The data and model allow for estimates of coverage and spending under different  coverage, payment, and benefits policies, for consumers, employers, state and  local governments, and the federal government for 5-, 10- and 15-year periods.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The “Path” proposal  included population health initiatives aimed at lowering rates of chronic and  vaccine-preventable diseases. The model developed by Lewin estimated the health  care cost impact of policies addressing tobacco use, obesity, alcohol abuse,  and influenza immunization. The tobacco-related interventions included a  federal cigarette (and other tobacco products) tax increase (to six times the  current rate) and funding of smoking cessation programs with 10 percent of the  new tax revenues. Assumptions about decline in use of tobacco reflected both  the increased price due to the tax and the impact of cessation programs. Based  on previous studies, health care costs were estimated to decline for former  smokers for 15 years, with an increase in net health care spending due to longer  lives after that period. Because the model produced estimates for the first 15  years post implementation (2010-2024), subsequent reductions in savings are not  reported. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Obesity control  measures include a one-cent tax per 12 oz. of sweetened soft drinks, with 10  percent of the revenues from the tax granted to states for obesity reduction  programs, contingent on state enforcement of bans in the use of trans fats by  restaurants and sweetened beverages in schools, and nutrition posting by chain  restaurants. The model projected the national trend in the growth of obesity  rates from 1998 to 2005 forward, used an estimate from the literature on the  proportion of health expenditures due to obesity of 6.25 percent, and then  assumed that the obesity control provisions would slow the growth of the share  of national health expenditures attributable to obesity to one half the  historic rate (from 0.4 to 0.2 percent). The “Path” proposal included a  doubling of the federal excise tax on alcohol, and provided for a share of  these revenues to be applied to national alcohol and illicit substance abuse  prevention programs, and to block grants to states for similar purposes. The  Lewin Group report cites the estimated economic burden of excessive alcohol  consumption, but does not make any assumptions about the health or expenditure  impact of reduced consumption due to the higher tax or increased programmatic  activity to counter alcohol and substance abuse. Although a demand response to  the higher purchase price of alcoholic beverages is not discussed, the  estimated increase in federal revenues (which are just under half of reported  excise take revenues of $9 billion annually) suggests that the modelers assumed  that demand was relatively price-elastic. The modelers discussed the evidence  about the cost-effectiveness of annual influenza immunization for different age  groups but do not make an estimate of net impact on overall health spending.  Finally, the results for separate provisions are adjusted for overlapping  effects of various health plan provisions in the summary tables.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Archimedes. </i></b>The  Archimedes model is a highly detailed agent-based simulation model that uses  available physiological and process-of-care data to predict clinical and  economic effects of a wide variety of health interventions. Physiological  variables are anatomical or biological, but also include risk factors such as  age, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol. Process-of-care variables include  service delivery, administrative, and financial factors. In the physiological  component of Archimedes, an abnormal combination of variables constitutes a  disease and clinical tests can be used to observe these variables at any point  in time to indicate clinical events. To model health interventions, variables  can be input as a value change or a rate of value change (Schlessinger and  Eddy, 2002).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Mathematically, the  physiological processes model consists of four equations: a natural projection  of the variables and their interactions; the occurrence of events as a function  of variables; the effect of interventions on events and variables; and the  function of organs (Schlessinger and Eddy, 2002). The simulation of an agent  over time uses differential equations and is a random process by assigning  parameter distributions, derived from person-specific data. Any missing  person-specific data is replaced with imaginary data that is consistent with  real data, to accurately simulate the observed clinical events. If only  aggregated data is available, it is translated into person-specific data by  either using available data to model the relationship between the clinical  event and an aggregated variable or making the simplifying assumption that a  certain percentage of persons would experience the clinical event.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Prior to its  application in predicting the impact of specific health interventions, the  Archimedes model requires validation. Schlessinger and Eddy (2002) present  several types of validation exercises that simulate clinical studies and  compare them with the results in the observed study. In general, the equations  must fit the data used to derive them; one or more of the equations must be  accurate; and the prediction of health outcomes must be accurate. The authors  consider a model valid if the equations are validated by at least one of the  validation exercises. Once the model is validated, the level of model detail is  verified based on three considerations: the scope of the question; the  confidence of the model including all relevant clinical factors; and the  availability of data.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The Archimedes model  has been applied to diabetes. Eddy and Schlessinger (2003a, b) developed and  then validated this application of Archimedes by building in information from  clinical trials of different preventive interventions and comparing the model  results to the real trial results. They found no statistically significant  differences between model results and clinical trial results in most of their  validation exercises; the correlation between the model and trial outcomes was  r = 0.99. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Eddy and colleagues (2005)  also employed the model in a CEA, comparing behavioral, pharmaceutical, and  usual care to manage people at high risk for diabetes. The CEA used time  horizons of 10, 20, and 30 years. Over 30 years and from the societal  perspective, the intensive behavioral intervention for persons with impaired  glucose tolerance was $62,600/QALY and for metformin therapy it was $35,400, in  both cases compared to no intervention. An alternative model, developed by the  Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group (DPPRG) and using the same  interventions, produced different results, particularly for the behavioral  intervention (Herman et al., 2005). Using a Markov model and a lifetime time  horizon, the authors report a cost of $8,800/QALY for the lifestyle  intervention, and a relatively similar $29,900/QALY for metformin therapy. In a  commentary, one of the coauthors of the DPPRG study examines possible reasons  for the different cost-effectiveness results, particularly as a number of  clinically relevant results were similar (Engelgau, 2005). He concludes that  different assumptions used in the two models about the rate of glycemic  progression and the longer time horizon for the DPRRG model, which allows more  complications to develop that could be offset by the intervention, are likely  the major contributors to the differing results.</p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">As alternative  frameworks for the economic analysis of interventions to improve health emerged  over the past half-century, so did different strategies for assigning value to  different states of health. The first approach, cost-of-illness analysis,  considered the direct costs incurred in medical care provided and the impact on  <i>human capital</i>, the present value of productivity losses due to illness  and premature death.  Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) avoided the  monetization of health outcomes by presenting the results of an analysis as the  cost to achieve a single unit of a given health outcome, which could be either  a <i>health event</i> such as a death averted, a case of cancer prevented, or a  day of illness avoided; or a <i>synthetic measure</i> that could represent a  combination of discrete health outcomes, such as a QALY<i>. </i>Benefit–cost  analysis (BCA) requires that all benefits and costs be valued in monetary terms  and non-market goods, including health and life itself, are valued according to  the aggregate of individuals’ <i>willingness to pay</i> (WTP)<i> </i>for a  given outcome<i>. </i>Different approaches to estimating WTP include capturing <i>preferences  revealed </i>through market transactions and eliciting <i>stated preferences. </i>Each  of these approaches is<i> </i>described below.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The choice of  evaluating health impacts through CEA or BCA is largely determined by the decision  about how health outcomes should be measured. In the U.S. in particular, and in  economic analyses limited to the health services sector, CEA has been the  approach overwhelmingly used.  In multi-sector analyses, such as regulatory  impact analysis, and in studies by international agencies such as OECD and WHO,  BCA is much more likely to be used. The following subsections discuss the  single-outcome (natural) and synthetic metrics used in CEAs, and the monetary  valuation of health impacts in BCAs. Section 2.5 then compares and  distinguishes the features of single-dimension metrics, HALYs, and WTP-based  monetized measures. The final subsection addresses issues in the valuation of  the benefits of prevention arising from federal estimation and budgeting rules and  procedures.  </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Cases of illness or  injuries, deaths, hospitalizations, and days lost from work or school are  routinely collected health outcomes that often serve as a one-dimensional  metric in CEAs of health interventions. The principle limitation of using  single-outcome measures in CEA is that, the results of individual studies  expressed in terms of different outcomes cannot be readily compared or combined.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Mortality measures are  the oldest among population-based health status metrics. <i>Preventable </i>or<i>  premature deaths averted</i> figured prominently in early regulatory risk  assessments. Once CEA began to be used in health care studies, <i>years of life  saved</i>, reflecting differences in remaining life expectancies, became a  common metric. </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">HALY measures, which  include QALYs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and other constructs, represent  the health-related quality of life (HRQL) impacts of different conditions,  including functioning in domains such as mobility, emotion, social activity,  and self-care. These measures assign index values to states of health that  reflect particular states’ relative desirability or their implications for  HRQL. The index values typically fall within a zero-to-one scale, where zero  corresponds to death and one corresponds to perfect or optimal health. States  of disability or morbidity have intermediate values, with lower values  representing more severe impairments. For public policy decisions, the Panel on  Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (PCEHM) recommends that these  condition weights be based on the preferences of the general population  (“community weights”), rather than those of patients or clinicians, to better  reflect societal values (Gold et al., 1996). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Quality-adjusted  life years (QALYs)</i></b><i>. </i>Summary health measures for CEA were first  suggested in the mid-1960s (Chiang, 1965; Fanshel and Bush, 1970). A decade  later, theoretical arguments and analytical guidelines for using QALYs to  evaluate health and medical practices were offered by Weinstein and Stason  (1977), who noted that QALYs combine information about changes in survival and  morbidity so as to reflect individuals’ willingness to trade off health and  longevity. HRQL measures reflect both the nature of the health state—including,  for example, observable and unobservable symptoms, functional capabilities, and  individual perceptions of health—and the importance or value that individuals  or populations ascribes to these various aspects of health. HRQL scales have  been designed for specific disease or health conditions, but the most widely  used metrics are based on generically described states of health, and thus are  applicable across all diseases or conditions. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">QALY metrics have been  derived from both psychometrics (the theory and techniques of measuring  psychological phenomena such as attitudes) and utility theory. Typically QALY  metrics are constructed using a combination of psychological survey and  decision-theoretical techniques. As preference-based measures, the values assigned  to specific health states in an HRQL scale reflects the relative strength of  preference for one state as compared with another. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The four most common methods  for eliciting preferences for health states are: standard gamble (SG); time  trade-off (TTO); category rating (CR) or visual analogue scale (VAS); and person  trade-off (PTO). </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>In standard gamble, respondents must determine the conditions of equivalence  between two alternatives, one of which is the certainty of being in the health  state of interest (which is something less than full health). The other  alternative has two possible outcomes: either full health or immediate death.  The respondent is asked to name the risk of immediate death (with probability <i>p</i>),  along with the complementary probability of living in full health (1-p) that  would make this risky alternative equally attractive as the impaired health  state. 1-p is then the value assigned to the impaired state of health. </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>In time trade-off, respondents are asked to choose between living  in a state of impaired health for the remainder of life or living for a fixed  (shorter) number of years in full health, followed by immediate death. The  number of years in full health at which the respondent is indifferent between  the alternatives is divided by remaining life expectancy to yield the value of  the impaired health state.</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>In category rating or visual analogue scale, respondents are  asked to rate a state of impaired health on a scale of 0 to 100, or mark a  visual aid such as a “feeling thermometer.”</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>In person trade-off, respondents are asked to choose between  health interventions and health states for others, indicating how many outcomes  of one kind they consider equivalent in social value to a given number of  outcomes of another kind.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">These  alternative methods ask different questions and can stress different facets of  the relative value of various health states. Each of the four methods has distinctive  advantages and proponents. Standard gamble is notable in that the choice  embodies risk. Because most people are risk averse, weights for a given health  state elicited through standard gamble tend to be higher (closer to optimal  health) than weights derived from other elicitation methods. Economists advocate  using standard gamble or time trade-off to elicit preferences because these  approaches require making choices that reflect an opportunity cost, giving up  one valuable good for another. Rating scale approaches like VAS are generally  thought to be less burdensome for respondents than time trade-off or standard  gamble, and result in fewer respondents opting out of the exercise. Some respondents  refuse to engage in the exercise of trading off length of life or a higher risk  of immediate death for a better health status (Brazier et al., 1999; Reed et  al., 1993).  Although standard gamble and time trade-off can be harder to  administer (e.g., asking children with diabetes if they would be willing to  live a shorter life to be disease free), these techniques allow for a more  rigorous distinction between the annoyances and disruptions of a disease and  substantial impacts that significantly reduce quality of life.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The person trade-off approach  introduces other-directed or altruistic interests and has not been used as widely  as the other approaches, although it was used to establish the original  disability-adjusted life year (DALY) weights (Murray and Acharya, 1997). The person  trade-off technique requires posing a large number of choices to construct a  robust set of relative values for different diseases (Green, 2001). It has also  performed poorly, relative to other approaches, in tests of reliability and  internal consistency (Patrick et al., 1973; Ubel et al., 1996). Because the person  trade-off technique requires posing a large number of choices to construct a  robust set of relative values for different diseases, it is cognitively  challenging, and has been found to be less reliable and less internally  consistent than other approaches (Green, 2001; Ubel et al., 1996).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Disability-adjusted  life years (DALYs).</i></b><i> </i>The World Health Organization (WHO)  developed DALYs to serve as a summary measure of population health for the  Global Burden of Disease study, launched in the mid-1990s (Murray and Acharya,  1997). The DALY measures potential years of life lost to premature death,  adjusting those years to reflect the <i>equivalent years of healthy life</i>  lost through poor health or disability. The DALY index scale inverts the QALY  scale: for DALYs, 0 corresponds to perfect health and 1 to death. In contrast to  QALYs, which reflect health states characterized generically, DALY values  correspond to specific health conditions.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The approach taken to characterize  and scale non-fatal health outcomes for DALYs has been revamped several times  since the initial formulation of this measure for the 1990 Global Burden of  Disease study (WHO, 2009: <i>WHO et al., 2009</i>). In the 1996 estimation of DALY  weights, health professionals developed descriptions of particular disabilities  and then other groups of health experts valued the disabilities, using the person  trade-off method, as part of a deliberative process (Murray and Lopez, 1996;  Gold et al., 2002). These DALY weights were constructed with two controversial  features: higher weights given to years of adult productivity and decrements  calculated from the worldwide maximum life expectancy (Japanese women). Neither  feature is essential to the DALY calculation, and today DALYs have multiple  formulations (de Hollander et al., 1999; Fox-Rushby and Hanson, 2001). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">For the most recent GBD  Study (2005), WHO is substantially revising the estimation of disability  weights in response to criticisms of the DALY, including the measure’s  exclusive reliance on expert panels and the use of the person trade-off method  (Salomon, 2010; WHO, 2009;). The latest approach to developing disability  weights includes a comprehensive re-estimation of about 230 unique “sequelae,”  or states of health consequent to specific diseases and injury causes. This re-estimation  includes both population-based household surveys in the U.S. and five other  countries and overlapping open-access internet surveys, which will present  simple paired-comparison questions to elicit respondents’ views of better and  worse health states for about 50 of the sequelae. Using conjoint analytic techniques  to infer cardinal weights for a population from individual rank orderings, this  population-based information will be used by groups of health professionals to apply  to the interpolation of values for all 230 sequelae, using ranking and VAS  techniques. Finally, a third set of elicitation activities will be conducted  with highly educated respondents at each of the original survey sites, using standard  gamble and time trade-off techniques, to validate previous estimates of the  disability weights (WHO, 2009). </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Estimating a monetary value for a benefit that is not traded  in the market, such as good health or a reduced risk of death within a certain  time period, relies on the notion of individual WTP: the maximum amount of  money an individual would exchange to obtain the benefit of good health or  lower mortality risk, subject to the individual’s budget constraints.<span>P4F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"><span><sup>[5]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> Researchers can  estimate monetary values for such nonmarket goods by asking people what they  would be willing to pay for the health improvement or risk reduction. Specific  methods for eliciting WTP within the general <i>stated preference</i> strategy include  contingent valuation surveys and conjoint analysis.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">WTP can be particularly  helpful in coverage decisions for both private and public insurers.  The  insurers know what they would have to pay to cover the intervention.  WTP  provides a measure of what consumers would be willing to pay if they had to pay  for the intervention out of their own pockets.  If the benefit/utility is so  low that consumers would not pay for it themselves, the likelihood that an  insurer would cover it is greatly reduced. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">A second broad strategy  is to estimate WTP based on market information about related goods, referred to  as <i>revealed preference </i>methods. One source of revealed preferences for estimating  the value of health and mortality risk reductions is the compensating wage  differential for riskier jobs, controlling for other factors that affect wage  levels (wage-risk studies). Another source of revealed preferences for risk  reductions is the voluntary purchase of safety equipment such as bicycle  helmets by consumers. WTP estimates of the value of changes in the risk of  premature mortality, using either or both stated and revealed preference  studies, have been formulated as the <i>value of a statistical life (VSL). </i>VSL  is a theoretical construct representing the aggregation over a large population  of the value of reducing a relatively small risk of mortality. <i> </i>WTP for  mortality risk reductions vary by the nature of the risk (e.g., whether the  risk is undertaken voluntarily, such as sky diving, or is involuntary, such as  from a plane crash) and the type of death (sudden versus prolonged, from  cancer).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Many federal agencies use VSL in BCAs for regulatory impact  analyses.<span>P5F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"><span><sup>[6]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> OMB guidance  on VSL (Circular A-4, 2003) notes that various studies reported VSLs of between  $1 million and $10 million; agencies may adopt their own estimate, as long as  the rationale for the choice is given.

The most recent research on VSL includes  meta-analyses that variously reported mean VSLs of $2.6 million (Mrozek and  Taylor, 2002), $5.4 million (Kochi et al., 2006), and $5.5−$7.6 million  (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003), in either 1998 or 2000 dollars.<span>P6F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7"><span><sup>[7]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> The  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, uses a central estimate for  VSL of $7.4 million (2006 dollars), and the Department of Transportation (DOT)  of $6.0 million (2008 dollars) (DOT, 2009; EPA, 2010).</p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><span>Although much of the effort of calculating HALYs involves establishing  the </span>relative values of different states of health rather than changes in  longevity, survival impacts usually overwhelm HRQL impacts in CEAs using QALYs.  Chapman and colleagues (2004) reviewed 63 studies with a total of 173 paired cost-effectiveness-ratios,  reporting both cost per life year ($/LY) and cost per quality-adjusted life  year ($/QALY), The authors reported that quality adjusting life years resulted  in a relatively small difference between LY and QALY ratios, with a median  difference of $1,300. A separate review by Tengs (2004) of 110 cancer  prevention, early detection, and treatment interventions, also examined  differences between $/LY and $/QALY ratios, with findings consistent with those  of the Chapman study: the LY and QALY ratios had a very high rank order  correlation. The conclusion of both studies was that quality-adjusting life  years would have affected decisions about cost-effectiveness for only a small fraction  of the studies—8 and 5 percent in the Chapman and Tengs studies, respectively—if  $50,000 per life year or QALY were used as the decision threshold. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Constructing a HRQL index and a HALY metric that reflects  the general population’s relative assessment of different health outcomes involves  surveys similar to those to elicit WTP. By design, however, HALY measures are  independent of individuals’ income or wealth, while WTP surveys capture  differences among individuals that reflect different resource constraints. In  practice, however, the income or wealth term is not always statistically  significant in WTP studies and HALY measures may be influenced by individuals’  income or wealth.<span>P8F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="" id="_ftnref9"><span><sup>[9]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> Another  important distinction is that WTP values demonstrate the extent of tradeoffs  that individuals are willing to make between widely different uses of  resources, whereas HALY metrics limit trade-offs to those between different  states of health. Finally, even though HALY measures are based on surveys eliciting  individual choices, some welfare economists argue that these choices do not  fully conform to the theoretical concept of utility (Dolan and Edlin, 2002).<span>P9F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10"><span><sup>[10]</sup></span></a></p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Using a cost-per-QALY dollar limit as a general guide when  using CEA to allocate resources or to establish a threshold for policy action  has been hotly debated, and even agencies such as the National Health Service  in Great Britain, where CEA is considered in funding decisions for new  services, deny the existence of an explicit cutoff.<span>P10F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11"><span><sup>[11]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> It can be argued that using such a threshold value essentially  turns CEA into BCA (Phelps and Mushlin, 1991).

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Unfortunately modeling  methodologies developed to maximize the rigor in the clinical or epidemiological  context are sometimes not as helpful in informing public policy decisions.  The  federal government has developed specific rules and methodologies to help  policymakers make informed decisions between competing policy priorities.   These competing priorities range well outside health and health care and  include such disparate issue areas as defense spending, tax policy and  government procurement.  A prime example is the way the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) models expected spending on current and new federal programs.  A  parallel process has evolved in the executive branch, with the exceptions of  two long term entitlements, Social Security and Medicare.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The opposite is also  true; the modeling conventions of public agencies, which are designed to maximize  ease of comparison across policy options, are sometimes not helpful in  informing public policy decisions on health issues that do not have the same  dynamics as the typical policy choices. For example, chronic diseases can take  decades to manifest and prevention interventions consequently take decades to  generate savings.  While the modeling conventions of organizations like CBO and  CMS’s Office of the Actuary work well to help congressional and administration  decision makers choose between most policy options, often they do not capture  the natural history of a chronic disease, changes in quality of life, or  spending and savings beyond the first ten years.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Both the legislative  and executive branches typically use a ten-year budget “window” for policy  projections.  Exceptions include the supplemental 75-year projections done for  the Social Security and Medicare Trustees’ Report, and CBO’s annual Long Term  Budget Outlook report.  (Also, as discussed earlier, CBO’s practices are  changing and projections are sometimes made for longer time horizons.) The 10-year  budget window, originally 5 years, evolved over time for two reasons. First, modeling  capabilities had improved to the point that there was confidence the projection  period could be expanded with meaningful results.  Second, enterprising congressional  committee chairs were increasingly moving spending into the sixth and seventh  year of their proposed programs.  The second conventional practice of public sector  modelers, using nominal dollars rather than dollars discounted either for  inflation or the time value of money, reflects the idea that the estimate  should present actual out-year spending, not some form of discounted out-year  spending.  Notably, CBO’s 25- and 75-year Long Term Budget Outlook projections  report spending as a percentage of GDP. In the context of prevention, a short  projection period is problematic.  Many current prevention activities target  behavior that will not have a serious health consequence for years to come.  As  we saw with the other modeling methodologies, lifetime or at least 25-year  estimates are more common.  As we know from the natural histories of the  disease we are trying to prevent, an obese person does not develop type 2  diabetes in the year after putting on weight and the person diagnosed with  diabetes does not begin to experience the full onslaught of complications in  the next 5 years.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Figure 2 illustrates  this problem, using the example of type 2 diabetes.  The figure shows the  spending averted on diabetes and diabetes-related complications for two cohorts,  one with intensive control of their glucose levels and one with more  conventional control.  The intensive control cohort experiences the type of  management typically found in state-of-the art diabetes disease management  programs.  The figure demonstrates that intensive control reduces future  diabetes spending, but that those reductions do not begin until about the  eighth year of the intervention, with the vast majority of the savings  occurring after the first ten years.  Clearly the 20-year window used here  gives a more complete picture of the effects of the intervention.</p>

The horizontal axis is the number of years since intervention and the vertical axis is the average annual costs averted from complications in 2007 US dollars. Over time, both cohorts show an increase in annual costs averted, but the intensive control cohort is increasing faster than the conventional protocol cohort. The divergence begins at around year 3 and at 10 years, which is the typical CBO budget window, we see about a USD$400 difference. The savings are less than USD$100 until around the eighth year and then after the eleventh year, the difference in cost-savings exceed around USD$600. At the 20-year mark, there is an approximately USD$1200 more saved from the intensive protocol cohort than the conventional protocol cohort." /></p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"> </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">If CBO were to expand its  usual 10-year budget window, at least for cases where a longer perspective is  needed to give policymakers a more accurate picture of the tradeoffs, it would  then trigger renewed debate over the use of nominal dollars.  The current use  of nominal dollars is less of a problem over ten years than it would be over a 25-year  period or over the lifetime of the patient.  The concern is that nominal  dollars ignore both the effects of inflation on out-year spending and the time  value of money.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">CBO has confronted this  dilemma in the past and will increasingly confront it in the future, especially  with regard to preventive services and chronic disease interventions.  For  example, as far back as the mid-1980s when CBO had to estimate the budgetary  impact of a reformed federal employee pension system, they present two sets of  estimates: one set with their traditional budget window in nominal dollars and  another set of actuarial estimates using lifetime present value methodology.   The first estimate was consider the official score, but the set estimate  provided decision makers with a more comprehensive analysis of the budgetary  impact, if they decided to pass the reform legislation.  In this example the  concern was in the opposite direction, i.e., new pension systems tend to  significant savings in the early years matched by significant spending in the  later years once workers begin to retire.</p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Estimates of the cost  of illness or simulations of the economic value of health interventions are  often subjected to scrutiny by a variety of stakeholders of the health policy  under evaluation.  In the early decades of economic evaluation of health  interventions (1960s through the mid-1990s), few standards existed to guide the  development of studies; studies employed widely divergent assumptions for key  model decisions.  Over time, health economic methods have grown increasingly  standardized. Both journal reviewers and outside consumers of health economic  studies have come to demand substantial transparency and standardization in  core modeling decisions and the presentation of core results from these  studies. Recent models build upon epidemiological and clinical research conducted  over the prior two decades that have attempted to establish the efficacy of  particular interventions in both clinical and community settings. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Understanding the basic  methodological standards and best practices that are commonly accepted in the  prevention modeling field will assist policy makers in their assessments of new  health economic information as it is presented to them.  In section 3.1, we  first review the general estimation choices and steps that are taken in  prevention modeling studies, the importance of each step, and the opportunity  to introduce bias associated with each choice or step.  Next, in section 3.2,  we discuss different estimation or modeling approaches and discuss their  relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of modeling effort and flexibility.   After discussing the basic modeling framework and the steps taken to produce  estimates, in section 3.3 we discuss alternative approaches to measuring  outcomes and assessing economic impacts and potential new directions in valuing  health states that policy makers may wish to encourage.  In section 3.4, we  discuss the underlying principals and rationale for using the results of economic  models of preventive interventions, namely to assist in making difficult  decisions under conditions of uncertainty.   </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">This section reviews  the initial study design choices that shape cost-effectiveness analyses and  then reviews options involved for performing sensitivity analyses.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Estimation and  standards of the baseline analysis.</i></b>  The initial design of a  cost-effectiveness study involves a set of choices that will shape the results  that flow from the analyses.  These choices include how outcomes will be  measured, the selection of a comparator, a specification of the time horizon,  the extent to which future costs and benefits will be discounted to reflect  their present value, and the perspective of the study which will determine  which types of costs and benefits will be included in the analysis.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>The comparator.</i></b>  The cost-effectiveness of an intervention or new technology is a relative  estimate which depends upon the scenario to which it is compared.  A comparator  (also known as the baseline or status quo) scenario is the counterfactual  alternative situation whose costs and benefits are compared to the intervention  or policy choice scenario in order to determine cost-effectiveness.  In a  cost-effectiveness analysis, a model is used to simulate the costs and benefits  of intervention strategy and the comparator counterfactual situation, and then  the incremental differences in costs and benefits are used to calculate the  incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER).  The equation for the ICER is  written as: </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">(Cost<span>R</span><sub>Intervention</sub><span>R</span> – Cost<span>R</span><sub>Comparator</sub><span>R</span>) / (Benefits<span>R</span><sub>Intervention</sub><span>R</span> – Benefits<span>R</span><sub>Comparator</sub><span>R</span>) … (3.1.1)</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Note the importance of  the comparator in determining the size of difference in costs and benefits and  driving the ICER.  Because of this, policy makers should be certain to consider  whether the comparator scenario or scenarios used in the analysis appropriately  fit the policy context to which the results will be applied.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">While many older  studies utilized a no intervention scenario as their comparator, a more  realistic comparator is some form of estimate of the services the model’s target  population would be expected to use in the absence of an intervention.  For  example, in a recent paper evaluating the cost-effectiveness of dilated fundus  examinations of persons newly enrolling in Medicare at age 65, the authors  compared the intervention scenario to a comparator of usual care, where usual  care was the estimated annual probability of a dilated fundus examination of  current Medicare recipients (Rein et al., 2012). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Time horizon.</i></b>   The time horizon refers to the number of years the cost-effectiveness model is  run after model initiation.  The time horizon is important because it defines  the scope of benefits and costs that will be included in the model.  Longer  time horizons are able to capture more of the true costs and benefits of the  intervention.  In practice benefits and costs that occur far in the future are  more speculative and often rely on model-generated estimates of disease impacts  that are less certain than clinical observations or trial data.  The  appropriate time horizon will depend on the relevant decisions being made by  the policy maker.  A study that employs a lifetime time horizon is well within  the bounds of acceptable and sound research practice.  However, a lifetime time  horizon may not provide suitable information when a policy maker is most  concerned with costs and benefits that accrue over the short or intermediate  term.  Simulation results have demonstrated that the specification of the time  horizon can have substantial impacts on the cost-effectiveness results generated  from a model, especially when the model employs the standard 3 percent discount  rate (see next section) (Sondhi, 2005).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>The discount  rate.</i>  </b>The discount rate represents the time preference of the model  for benefits that occur today in comparison to benefits that occur in the  future.  A foundational concept of classical microeconomics is that individuals  prefer benefits gained today over identical benefits gained in the future and  that the extent of this preference can be estimated based on a rate function  (Menger, 1892).  Put simply, individuals prefer $1 today than $1 next year and  the degree of this preference can be measured by the percentage of that $1 that  would have to be paid to convince someone to exchange the $1 today for the $1  next year.  The value of future benefits after accounting for discounting is  called its net present value (NPV) and is calculated as:</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">NPV = Value<span>R</span><sub>future</sub><span>R</span> / (1+r)<span>P</span><sup>n</sup><span>P</span> … (3.1.2)</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Where Value <span>R</span><sub>future </sub><span>R</span>is equal to the value of the specific benefit or cost at the time  it occurs in the future, r is equal to the discount rate, and n is the number  of years in the future that the benefit or cost occurred.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The discount rate is  sometimes confused with the inflation rate, but this is incorrect.  The  discount rate measures true differences in value attributed to current benefits  as compared to those that occur in the future, whereas inflation measures only  the erosion of purchasing power of a currency over time.  The discount rate is  applicable even in a world where inflation is equal to zero; the vast majority  of cost-effectiveness models do in fact constrain inflation to zero (Haddix et  al., 2003).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Discount rates used in cost-effectiveness studies are highly  variable across studies, but generally range from 0 to 10 percent (Nixon et al.,  2000).  The PCEHM reviewed a wide range of standards used in the United States  to set discount rates before specifying 3 percent, an approximation of the  average shadow price of capital over the long term in the United States, for  use in its recommended reference case analysis. (Gold et al., 1996).<span>P11F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12"><span><sup>[12]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> This  standard has been widely adopted in United States cost-effectiveness research.   </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The discount rate  determines the extent to which benefits that occur across the time-horizon  influence the policy decision made based on the model’s results.  Figure 3  illustrates the number of years at which the present value of $1 of future  benefits or costs falls to $0.50, or half its original value.  As the figure  illustrates, the value of future benefits and costs falls rapidly with an  increasing discount rate.  At a rate of 1 percent future benefits and costs  maintain over half their value until 70 years after the simulation begins.  In  contrast, at the most commonly used discount rate of  3 percent, future  benefits and costs retain over half their until 24 years after the simulation  begins,  a value that falls to 14 years at a rate of 5 percent and to 7 years  at a rate of 10 percent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img id="Picture 16" src="../system/files/images-reports-basic/71016/image003.png" alt="This exhibit illustrates the number of years at which the present value of $1 of future benefits or costs falls to $0.50, or half its original value.  The value of future benefits and costs falls rapidly with an increasing discount rate.  At a rate of 1 percent, future benefits and costs maintain over half their value until 70 years after the simulation begins; at a rate of 2 percent, future benefits and costs maintain over half their value until 35 years after the simulation begins. In contrast, at the most commonly used discount rate of  3 percent, future benefits and costs retain over half their original value until 24 years after the simulation begins,  a value that falls to 18, 14, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7 years for a rate of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively." /></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Researchers sometimes  argue that the time-horizon chosen is irrelevant because most future benefits  are heavily discounted in terms of their present value.  As figure 3  illustrates, this can be a potentially error-inducing generalization.  At the 3  percent discount rate, the one most commonly used by modelers in the United  States, future benefits and costs still hold substantial present value even  when they occur decades into the simulation.  Policy makers who are substantially  more concerned with the near term costs and benefits of an intervention should  seek out results that utilize higher discount rates in their analyses.     </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Study Perspective.</i>   </b>The study perspective refers to the<b> </b>person, individual, or population  to which the costs and benefits of an intervention are realized.  For example,  the costs and benefits of an intervention are different from the perspective of  an individual than from the perspective of a health plan.  The individual  generally pays only a small portion of the costs of health care and receives  all the health benefits.  In contrast health plans may pay virtually all the  costs of the same intervention, but may not enjoy any of the benefits of the  preventive health affects occur after the patient transfers to a different  health plan.  Mapping costs and benefits from different perspectives allow the  model results to illustrate differences in incentives across stakeholders  involved in the intervention. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Perspectives taken in  cost-effectiveness models include the patient, provider, hospital, health plan,  health care system, and the societal.  In some circumstances, it may not be  beneficial for a study’s authors to present all perspectives.  The PCEHM  present the example of a hypothetical medical device that is cost-effective or  cost-saving from the hospital’s perspective, but achieved this success by  transferring costs to other aspects of the health care system (Gold et al.,  1996).  To facilitate comparisons across studies, and to avoid cherry picking  of favorable perspectives, current cost-effectiveness standards recommend the  inclusion of the a societal (or health care if societal is not feasible)  perspective as a reference case, even if the primary interest of the paper is  to examine differences in cost-effectiveness at a more granular level.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Model Validation.</i></b>  In scientific practice, validation refers to the ability of an experiment or  scientific inquiry to uncover true causal relationships, and the extent to  which the relationships in the study can be extended to other situations.  In  the world of prevention modeling, researchers construct mathematical  representations of reality in order to test the impact of changes in policy or  treatment.  The key questions of validity regard whether the results generated  by the model can be used to make policy decisions.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Preventive services  models are often evaluated in terms of their fidelity, and their internal,  cross-model, and external validity.  Fidelity, also known as <i>face validity</i>,  refers to the integrity of the model structure the quality of the data used to  populate it, and the degree to which a model adheres to reality (Feinstein and  Cannon, 2001).  Models should be constructed based on current medical  understanding of the disease or phenomena under consideration.  Although models  must always simplify reality in order to be tractable, models that omit  important aspects of disease progression that affect either patient outcomes or  costs lack validity in making economic decisions.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In experimental design,  <i>internal validity</i> refers to the quality of evidence that results from a  particular experiment.  Selection bias or other forms of confounders weaken the  power of evidence obtained from a trial.  In theory, simulation models avoid  selection bias and confounders because simulated agents can be matched  perfectly in terms of their traits.  In practice, bias can be introduced by the  modeler either through conscious or inadvertent parameter selection that favors  a certain policy of choice, or through the use of low-quality data or studies  to populate the model’s parameters.  The threat of bias can be diminished by  publishing the model’s parameters and sources and through a review of those  parameters by independent experts.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Another test of the  internal validity is to assess whether the model can recreate the  epidemiological data used to program it. When the population parameters of a  model are specified to fit the epidemiological context of its input data, a  model should be able to recreate the population prevalence and/or incidence  seen in that study.  Failure to do so can indicate an internal programming  error, the incorrect logic applied to the use of a given parameter, or a  confounding dependency embedded in the model’s processes.  </p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><i>Cross-model validity</i>  refers to the ability of a simulation model to produce estimates that are  concordant with those published earlier using similar models (Eddy et al., n.d.).   If a model uses the same basic data and structure as earlier models, then it should  result in epidemiologically similar estimates.  If it fails to do so, then its  internal validity should be questioned, as the same data is resulting in  different results.  Differences in estimates can occur from the application of  the model to a different context, through differences in model specification,  or from the incorporation of new or different data inputs.  The purpose of  cross-model validation is to articulate how estimates generated from a given  model are similar to or differ from earlier modeled estimates regarding the  same topic.  Caution should be used in rejecting model estimates simply because  they do not conform to earlier estimates, especially when only one previous  estimate exists or when all previous models were generated by the same author  or team.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><i>External validity</i>  refers to the ability to generalize results obtained by the model to a wider  set of circumstances.  In most simulation contexts, external validity would  refer to the ability to make decisions about the actual world based on the  findings of the model.  Because simulation models are always simplifications of  complex systems that in themselves occur with some degree of random variation,  models will rarely result in exact reproductions of empirical reality.  The  topic of the external validity of simulation results is quite wide and  encompasses many areas of philosophy of science.  Questions of how close a  model’s predictions must be to an externally generated dataset in order to be  considered valid are in fact impossible to answer.  Philosophers such as  Popper, Kuhn, and Feyerabend have argued that similarity cannot be judged in  absolute terms but instead must be understood relative to the situation  (Feinstein and Cannon, 2001). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In practice, what this  means is that the external validity of a model is often judged by comparing  model results to external data, articulating the degree to which the model  recreates important outcomes of interest, and allowing the reader to decide  upon the level of external validity the model possesses.  Often this exercise  is quite difficult, as appropriate external data for validation purposes may  not be available or may not have been collected for a population that is  similar to the one of interest in the simulation model.  In limited circumstances  contests have even been sponsored to test the external validity of several  different models developed by different research teams (Fourth Mount Hood  Meeting Report, 2007).  Policy makers evaluation a model’s external validity  should consider whether the authors attempted to compare their model to  external data, the circumstances which might have limited these comparisons,  the extent to which these comparisons were documented in technical appendixes,  the differences between the modeled data and the external data, the degree to  which these differences might influence the model’s results, and whether areas  of model weakness were appropriately accounted for in sensitivity analyses.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Modeling  uncertainty</i></b><i>. </i>Estimates derived from<i> </i>prevention models  contain uncertainty from at least three sources.  Individual random variation  is referred to as <i>first-order variability</i>, and usually occurs in  agent-based models that allow for individual differentiation within cohorts.   First-order variability is not a primary concern in most prevention models.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Variability in the  measurement of parameters is referred to as <i>second-order variability</i> and  is a primary concern in all models.  Second-order variability refers to the  fact that the parameters used in a model are sample estimates.  In the best of  circumstances these parameters have been drawn from experimental studies and  will have been measured with error.  In many other circumstances, parameters  may be based on averages of estimates across studies, on expert opinion, or simply  upon assumptions.  Models should attempt to account for the uncertainty caused  by their parameters through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses  (described below).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><i>Structural  uncertainty</i> refers to embedded assumptions of the model process that may be  incorrect.  For example, a model may assume a linear relationship between  disease progression and time, when in fact this relationship is nonlinear  (McKay et al., 1999).  Other aspects of model uncertainty may include the  options of treatment offered to patients after diagnosis.  For example, in a  paper on the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma treatment in the developing world,  the authors developed estimates based on an assumption of a one-time laser  surgical intervention following diagnosis and assumed no option for  pharmaceutical treatment for diagnosed patients (Wittenborn and Rein, 2011).   In practice structural or model uncertainty is rarely addressed outside of  somewhat ad-hoc scenario testing of alternative outcomes.  Policy makers  concerned with structural uncertainty may wish to consult work on Bayesian  simulation approaches to the problem (Briggs, 2000). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Univariate  sensitivity analyses</i></b>. Univariate sensitivity analyses offer a common  approach to testing variation in a single parameter.  In univariate sensitivity  analyses, a parameter’s value is varied to the extremes of its plausible ranges  while holding constant other variables in the model, in order to assess the  impact of that single variable on the model’s results.  Univariate sensitivity  analyses are quite valuable in identifying the parameters to which the model is  most sensitive.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Often the results of  multiple univariate sensitivity analyses are arranged in a tornado diagram, listing  the most influential variable in terms of its impact on the ICER at the top to  the least influential variable tested at the bottom. For example, Figure 4  illustrates the univariate sensitivity of a new screening strategy for  hepatitis C to one-at-a-time changes in model parameters.  </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img id="Picture 17" src="../system/files/images-reports-basic/71016/image004.jpg" alt="This exhibit illustrates a univariate sensitivity of a new screening strategy for hepatitis C to one-at-a-time changes in model parameters. There are 8 parameters ordered from top to down by most to least impact on the cost-effectiveness (CE) ratio. The first bar reflects a binary parameter, such that if there were no QALY losses from non-liver disease states, the CE ratio would increase by as much as over 15,000 dollars per QALY. The second bar reflects the discount rate which can range from 0 to 5 percent, and the CE ratio could increase or decrease by as much as just fewer than 15,000 dollars per QALY. The third bar is the probability of a sustained viral response, type 1, ranging from 0.23 to 0.44, and the CE ratio could increase by as much as around 5,000 dollars per QALY or decrease by as much as around 3,300 dollars per QALY. The fourth bar is the proportion of disease that is type 1, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 for Whites and 0.8 to 1.0 for American Africans. The CE ratio could increase by as much as around 4,000 dollars per QALY or decrease by as much as around 2,000 dollars per QALY. The fifth is cost per screening, ranging from 17 to 51 dollars, and it could increase or decrease the CE ratio by as much as around 4,000 dollars per QALY, The sixth is pegylated interferon with ribavirin costs, plus or minus 20 percent, and it could increase or decrease the CE ratio by as much as around 3,000 dollars per QALY. The seventh is the probability of a sustained viral response, type 2, ranging from 0.58 to 0.8, and it could increase or decrease the CE ratio by as much as around 2,000 dollars per QALY, The eight is the QALY losses from liver disease states, utilizing low and high values, and it could increase or decrease the CE ratio by as much as 1,000 dollars per QALY," /></p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Policy makers should  evaluate which parameters were selected for inclusion in the univariate sensitivity  analysis and the range of the values considered in the analysis. Major  weaknesses of the model can be hidden through omitting key parameters from such  analyses and results can be made to look either more or less certain based on  the ranges chosen. The ranges should be logical, justifiable, and when possible  based on empirical observations. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Probabilistic  sensitivity analysis and credible intervals.</i></b> Probabilistic sensitivity  analysis (PSA) is a simulation process to measure the impact of uncertainty  across all the major parameters in the model (or at least a set of major  parameters).  To conduct a PSA, the researcher specifies the distributional  shape and parameters for each of the variables in the model.  Ideally, these  parameters should be drawn from empirical data measuring the standard error of  the parameter and common distributional assumptions specified to the parameter  of interest (Briggs et al., 2006).  In the event the parameter variance cannot  be derived empirically, the modeler may construct it from the range of available  estimates, to match expert opinion, or using published guidelines (Doubilet et  al., 1985).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The modeler then  creates an <i>n x k</i> matrix of parameter values where <i>n</i> is the number  of simulations to be run and <i>k</i> is the number of parameters to be varied  in the PSA.  Each parameter is then sampled from its target distribution <i>n</i>  times to create a matrix of input values for use in the simulations.  This  table of possible input variables is then used to run the simulation so that  each iteration represents the model results given that particular draw of  parameter.  PSA results can then be evaluated to estimate the mean and the  credible interval of the simulated results, or to plot the entire distribution  of the simulated results.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The ability to create  credible intervals, the Bayesian alternative to confidence intervals, is one of  the key advantages of conducting a PSA.  In concrete terms, using the simulated  results we are able to create the possible range of outcomes predicted by the  model after propagating parameter uncertainty through the entire model  structure.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Cost-effectiveness  acceptability curves.</i></b><i>  </i>Policy makers should realize that all  prevention models are uncertain; their results are probabilistic, not  deterministic. (This is true, although not obvious, even when model analyses  have not been conducted in a probabilistic manner).  Thus assessments of  cost-effectiveness can only be stated as probabilities, not certainties, and  are contingent upon the amount a policy maker is willing to pay for given  preventive benefit. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The results from  probabilistic sensitivity analyses<i> </i>can be used to create  cost-effectiveness acceptability curves<i> </i>(CEAC), which summarize the  probability that each scenario under consideration is the most cost effective  given different values of willingness to pay (WTP) for the benefit. CEACs are  constructed by comparing the net health benefit of each intervention, for every  simulated iteration, at each value of willingness to pay.  The net benefit is  equal to:</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Net Benefit<span>R</span><sub>i</sub><span>R</span> = Benefit<span>R</span><sub>i</sub><span>R</span> ∙ WTP – Cost<span>R</span><sub>i</sub><span>R</span> … (3.1.3)</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Where<i> i</i>  indicates the scenario measured, and WTP indicates the particular willingness  to pay valuation used.  Because net benefit is linear, net benefit estimates  for each scenario can be directly compared without having to rely on  incremental results.  To create a CEAC, the research compares the net benefit  of each scenario at each WTP value and codes the intervention with the largest  net benefit the most cost-effective.  The researcher then calculates the  proportion of simulations “won” by each intervention at each WTP value and  charts these proportions against WTP in a line graph. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">For example, Figure 5  displays the probability that each of four screening options is the most  cost-effective given a range of WTP values per incremental QALY gained (Rein et  al., forthcoming).  The far left of the figure represents a policy maker who is  willing to pay nothing per incremental QALY gained.  At that value (WTP=$0),  100 percent of this model’s simulations determined that no screening was the  most cost-effective alternative.  Progressing rightward on the x axis, the WTP  increases and the probability that no screening is most cost-effective  decreases.  At a WTP value of $16,000 per QALY saved, birth-cohort screening  with standard treatment becomes the option most likely to be cost-effective.   The probability that birth-cohort screening with standard treatment is  most-cost-effective increases to near certainty at a WTP value of approximately  $27,000 per QALY gained and then begins to fall as birth-cohort screening with  more expensive direct acting antiviral therapy becomes more likely to be most  cost-effective at higher values of WTP.  Note that risk-based screening, the  current standard of care, is never the most likely to be the most cost-effective.</p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">CEACs have limitations  in assisting decision makers (Koerkamp et al., 2007). The primary disadvantage  of CEACs is that they ignore extreme outcomes.  For example, CEACs only detects  the proportion of scenarios in which a scenario “wins” and ignores information  about when that scenario loses.  As a result, a scenario with a lower expected  value may appear to be more cost-effective than a scenario with a higher  expected value if it is more frequently cost-effective but the instances in  which it is not lead to extreme losses.  Related to this concept, while CEACs  present the probability of making a wrong decision, they do not provide any  information about the consequences of that decision.  In addition, CEACs may  create urgency for policy action when an intervention appears highly likely to  be the most cost-effective, even though the net benefits of this intervention  may be small. For these reasons and others, alternatives to CEACs such as  credible intervals and value-of-information analysis are important for  understanding the uncertainty surrounding a decision. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i><span>Value-of-information analyses</span></i></b><span>. </span>Value-of-information (VOI) analyses quantify  the potential opportunity losses that can result from making an incorrect  decision between mutually exclusive policy options.  Choosing between policy  options always entails a degree of uncertainty and a consequent probability of  an incorrect decision.  VOI analyses build off simulation results to estimate  the dollar value of additional research on a topic with the aim of reducing  uncertainty. VOI analyses can help set priorities for additional research by  identifying which decisions could result in the greatest opportunity losses if  made incorrectly and by identifying the value of additional information gained  about specific parameters used to make those decisions. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The value of  information, or expected value of perfect information (EVPI), is a function of  the incremental cost-effectiveness of a specific technology of interest, the  level of uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness estimate, and value  applied to the benefits gained by the intervention  (Briggs et al., 2006).   Although benefits are often measured in QALYs saved, VOI approaches can be  applied to any concrete benefit that a policy is designed to maximize.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">EVPI can be estimated  numerically or non-parametrically from simulation results.  Numerical  approaches are easily implemented but depend upon assumptions that may often be  violated by results generated from decision-analytic approaches. For example,  if one assumes that the incremental net benefit (INB) of an intervention is  normally distributed, then the EVPI of an intervention can be solved as a  function of the slope of the loss function, the estimated INB, and its  variance.  Unfortunately, INB can rarely be assumed to be normally distributed  as most decision analytic models combine parameters from different experimental  observations with a range of distributions. Alternatives to numeric approaches  include sampling algorithms from simulation results, as well as minimal  modeling, and meta-modeling techniques which attempt to replace the decision  analytic model with a statistical alternative (Meltzer et al., 2011; Tappenden  et al., 2004). </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Decision models can  take many forms, from simple spreadsheet analyses and decision trees to more  complex model formulations.  Policy makers may sometimes request specific model  frameworks, given past familiarity, or because they have observed presentations  by strong modelers that showcase certain techniques.  Prescribing the modeling  technique to be used (for example in a request for proposals) is likely not  advantageous as every modeling approach has distinctive advantages and  disadvantages compared to others.  When choosing a model, the researcher should  consider at least the project budget and timeline, the immediate use and future  reuses of the model, and the minimum degree of complexity needed to model the  problem correctly.  Adding model complexity may increase model precision, but  it does so at the cost of time, research dollars, and model transparency. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In this section we  first discuss generic types of models, and then consider some common  alternative modeling structures, their strengths and weaknesses, and their  ideal applications.  The purpose of the section is to inform policy makers  about different modeling options so that they can understand the implications  of different modeling choices.   </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Model Types. </i></b>Several  different model types can be employed across a variety of model structures.   Kim and colleagues (2008) classify models in terms of four distinct dimensions:  (1) the ability of individuals in the model to interact (static versus  dynamic); (2) the ability of new individuals to enter the model as the time  steps of the model progresses (open versus closed); (3) whether population  averages are used or the model tracks individual actions (aggregate versus individual-based);  and (4) whether model transitions are variable or fixed (stochastic versus  deterministic).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Static models use fixed  parameters that are constant throughout the life of the model.  Dynamic models  allow changes between states in a model, usually dictated by disease incidence  parameters in a static model, to depend upon both fixed parameters (such as the  force of infection, and the rate at which people contact each other) and  changing or dynamic values such the proportion of individuals that are  infectious or susceptible to infection.  Because of the complexity of  developing dynamic models, static models are more frequently used and likely  preferable, except in circumstances where the intervention is likely to affect  the transmission of disease.  For example, Bauch and colleagues (2007)  developed a dynamic model of hepatitis A transmission to estimate the  cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination in Canada.  The dynamic form of the  model was able to capture additional herd immunity benefits of vaccination to  unvaccinated individuals. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">A model’s openness  refers to its ability to incorporate new populations over time.  Open models  allow new populations to age-in as older population die out.  This feature is  particularly important in disease transmission models where new susceptible  populations may join the model as the original susceptible population is  depleted.  Alternative versions of an open model may allow new cohorts to be  created to enroll in an intervention in time steps subsequent to the model’s  initiation.  As with dynamic models, open models are more important for disease  transmission models than for models of chronic diseases where disease  acquisition of one individual does not depend on the status of other  individuals. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Aggregate models refer  to models estimated at the population level.  Examples of aggregate-level  models are decision-tree and some state-transition models (see below), where  the model estimates are created from multiplying transition probabilities times  the proportion of the population in a given state.  In contrast,  microsimulations and agent-based models (see below) are examples of  individual-level models.  As their name implies, individual-level models  estimate the model’s processes at the level of an individual agent.  These  agents have both memory and embedded decision rules that govern their  behavior.  Aggregate-level models have the advantage of producing cleaner  estimates and are easier to program and manage.  Individual-level models may  offer some advantages in modeling group interactions, and can also be used to  ease the modeling of very complex systems.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Fixed versus stochastic  parameters refers to the element of random chance in the instantiation of model  events.  In general, models at the aggregate level use fixed parameters, while  microsimulations and agent-based models use stochastic parameters.   Person-level variation results in a much greater degree of variation in the  model’s estimates. Although methods exist to adjust the credible intervals of  net benefits derived from stochastic models, the higher variance of estimates  inherent to individual-level models remains one of their chief limitations  (O’Hagan et al., 2007).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Decision-tree  models</i>.</b>  Decision trees are model structures that help researchers  evaluate sequential chance solutions.  Unique solutions are represented by  pathways from the initiation of the decision through its final consequence.  A  basic decision trees consist of outcome states, choice points between state  alternatives, and terminal solutions.  Costs are assigned to each state and  probabilities are assigned to each choice point.  The expected value of each  terminal solution is then estimated as the sum of the products of each  probability, multiplied by each cost on the path to a given terminal solution.  The expected value of costs and utilities from a given solution is equal to the  sum of the expected values of all possible alternatives that stem from that  decision.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Decision-tree models  are relatively simple to construct, transparent, and easy to understand.   Stand-alone software packages such as TreeAge, and excel add-ons such as  TreePlan and @RISK allow for the easy implantation of decision trees that are  capable of performing complex analyses such as Monte Carlo simulations to  evaluate uncertainty.  Decision-tree models are potentially the most  cost-effective and timely solutions to relatively simple policy choices.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The primary  disadvantages of decision-tree models are that they poorly manage periodic (as  opposed to one-time) probabilities and they can quickly become unwieldy as the  number of mutually exclusive choices in the model increase.  Several software  packages now allow for ‘Markovian’ choice points (described below), mitigating  the first of these disadvantages.       </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>State-Transition  or Markov Chain Models</i>.</b>  State-transition models function by allocating  and reallocating a fixed population across two or more states over time.   Movements between states are governed by transition probabilities, which can be  drawn from clinical trial data or other data sources.  A Markov model is a  special case of a state-transition model in which the movements between states  depends only on the state in which a person is categorized (i.e., the model  requires no ‘memory’ of past states).  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Figure 6 illustrates a  simple Markov survival model in which state 1 represents life and state 2  represents death.  Individuals in the model experience an annual probability of  remaining alive, represented by the curved arrow p1,1, and an annual  probability of dying, represented by the straight arrow p1,2.  The common  notation used for p1,1 and p1,2 is read as the probability of starting in state  1 at the beginning of the time step and ending in state 1 at the end of the  time step, and the probability of starting in state 1 at the beginning of the  time step and ending in state 2 at the end of the time step.  In this simple  example, p1,1 is simply equal to 1 minus p1,2 (and vice versa). </p>

A curved arrow from the live state points back to itself and is labeled p1,1. There is a second straight arrow from the live state to death state and is labeled p1,2. The curved arrow p1,1 is the probability of starting state 1 at the beginning of the time step and ending in state 1 at the end of the time step. The straight arrow p1,2 is the probability of starting in state 1 at the beginning of the time step and ending in state 2 at the end of the time step." /></p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"> </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Estimation of a simple  Markov model can be performed using excel, a statistical package such as SAS,  using modeling analytic software, or programmed using a command language such  as Visual Basic or Java.  </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare">As an example, the simple survival model above can be estimated in terms  of the flows of population out of and into each state.  Assume the survival  model in figure 6 is parameterized to simulate a condition with a 20% annual  mortality rate.  In that case, transition p1,2 is equal to 0.20 and parameter  p1,1 is equal to 1.00 – 0.20 or 0.80.  Table 2 summarizes how these parameters  are used to transition individuals from living to deceased over the first 10  time steps of the model.  </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"> </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Year 0 of the model represents the distribution of the model  population at the time of model initiation.  In this case the entire population  is living with no one deceased.  In each subsequent year t, the proportion that  remain living is calculated as Living<span>R</span><sub>t-1</sub><span>R</span> – Living<span>R</span><sub> t-1</sub><span>R</span> x p1,2,  the proportion that are in the deceased state is equal to Deceased<span>R</span><sub> t-1</sub><span>R</span> + Living<span>R</span><sub> t-1</sub><span>R</span> x p1,2, thus the set of two  equations transitions those who die out of the living state and into the  deceased state.  </p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Costs and QALYs are  assigned to each state and calculated at the conclusion of each time step.   These cost and QALY outcomes can then be inflated by multiplying them by the  total population size at the start of the model. Models can capture more  complexity with the addition of states, and transition probabilities can be  differentiated (for example by age, gender, or genetic disposition) by  differentiating states.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">State-transition models  are better equipped to manage the mathematical calculations of complex diseases  with chronic durations.  The Markovian assumption that transitions from the  present state are independent of past or future states enhances the model’s  ability to manage complexity, but is not necessary to develop flexible  state-transition models.  Models may combine states that are memory-less with  other state transitions that depend on values obtained earlier in the model, although  this makes programming more complex.  For example, in a model of diabetic  retinopathy progression, Rein and colleagues (2011) combined primarily  Markovian transitions with a transition to vision-threatening states that was  calculated as a function of past duration of diabetes and 14 year average  hemoglobin A1c values. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The disadvantages of  state-transition models are the greater modeling complexity when compared to  decision tress, the tendencies for states to proliferate in complex models, and  the lack of transparency greater complexity engenders.  However, for most  chronic diseases, the added complexity is well worth the benefit of model  management that the structure offers.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Agent-based  models</i>.  </b>Agent-based models function by creating individual autonomous  entities that store information that dictates their behavior in future time  steps of the model.  An agent is a computer-simulated function or algorithm  that has the ability to recall information for use in the function, and  operates with autonomy from other functions in the model.  It tracks the  actions of a population of individuals over a set of defined time steps.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Agent-based models are  well-suited to model systems in which individual agents interact and the  outcomes of the model depend on these interactions.  They work well as  solutions for infectious disease models, which attempt to track the  epidemiology of potential emergent infections, because infection is determined  by individual attributes (susceptible, infected, or recovered) and by individual  actions such as movement and social contacts.  They are well suited for  problems that depend on spatial relationships, changes in individual behavior,  and when modeling memory is important.  Agent-based models are also well suited  for modeling complex environments.  For example, the Multiple Eye Disease  Simulation (MEDS) model uses an agent-based design to evaluate the visual and  economic impact of six different visual disorders, a system that would leads to  millions of individual state if the researchers had attempted to model it with  a state-transition model.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Agent-based models can  be programmed in a variety of commercial software packages, or can be coded  using generic packages such as spreadsheets, MATLAB, Java, or C++. The primary  disadvantages of agent-based models are the difficulty and time entailed in  programming them.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Microsimulation. </i></b> Microsimulation  offers another approach in individual-level modeling. Rather than depending on  a created set of agents governed by computer-simulated algorithms, a  microsimulation is based on a data set that describes a sample of individuals, households,  or organizations. Rules are applied to update the individual members of the  sample over time, essentially building in an aging process and other  probabilistic transitions. Because microsimulation uses an actual survey  sample, the results of a microsimulation are helpful in predicting the future  state of a real population. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The disadvantage of  this approach is that the aging process requires highly detailed transition matrices  specifying the probability that a member currently in one state will change to  some other state in a subsequent period and, because these probabilities vary  by individual characteristics, a matrix of conditional probabilities is needed.  This demands a large amount of data for estimation. Furthermore,  microsimulation does not allow for interactions among individuals nor can it  reflect proximity or separation, as can agent-based models.</p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Three broad areas in  which to assess the quality of health care decision models are the model  structure, data inputs, and validation. Model validation was discussed in the  previous subsection; here we address considerations in model structure and  data. The consensus report of an International Society for Pharmacoeconomic and  Outcomes Research (ISPOR) task force on good modeling practices outlines  criteria for judging model quality, and the following reflects the task force  guidance (Weinstein et al., 2003). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">First, the model  structure should reflect the disease of concern and intervention, even if the  disease process is not well understood. Sensitivity analyses should then employ  alternate model structures that account for this uncertainty. Markov models  should reflect health states that correspond to the underlying disease process;  the model should not eliminate states simply because of a lack of data. The  model should have cycles short enough so that multiple changes in a variable  over one cycle are unlikely. Overall, the model should account for  heterogeneity (or subpopulations) and the time horizon should be long enough to  reflect long-term consequences. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Model inputs should be  supported by systematic reviews; the exclusion of known data sources should be  justified. Assumptions about or limitations of the data should be clearly  documented. The base case for the model should be the strongest, most credible  choice. Data incorporated in the model should have consistent units, time  intervals, and population characteristics. Sensitivity analysis should be  performed for key parameters.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Finally, it should be  kept in mind that a model is not a fact or a prediction about the future, and  it should not be judged as either. Instead, a model represents the distillation  and combination of empirically based and hypothesis-driven arguments and  judgments in a way that illuminates the relationship between the model’s  assumptions and input data, and important outcomes and costs. Models aid  decision making by clarifying the implications of alternative courses of action  or policies but they do not dictate any particular choice.  </p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The past decade has seen a great acceleration of activity by  U.S. regulatory agencies and advisory bodies, those in other nations, and  international organizations in promulgating standards and best practices in the  economic evaluation and modeling of the benefits and costs of preventive  interventions. This section presents the outlines of key organizations’  guidance, first for regulatory and official advisory groups and then  professional and academically based in the U.S., and then for select,  influential foreign and international agencies, such as Great Britain’s  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), and the World  Health Organization (WHO).

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The late 1990s found  improvements in methodologies for economic analyses and modeling and an  increase in the number of published studies.  Those studies, however, had  limited impact on preventive health policies, largely because differences in  assumptions and methods made the findings incomparable across studies.   Organizations, committees, and task forces charged with recommending the  implementation or funding for preventive services recognized the value of  economic analyses but remained concerned about the quality and comparability of  the assumptions and methods.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In efforts to improve  and standardize economic analyses and modeling, a number of preventive services  advisory groups led efforts in the early 2000s to provide guidance and  standards for the inclusion of economic analyses and modeling into  effectiveness studies.  Since then—in part due to these focused guidances and  standards, as well as the increasing convergence in assumptions and modeling  following the release of the influential PCEHM’s reference case recommendation  in 1996—preventive services economic analyses and models have vastly improved.   Most preventive services advisory groups now include economic analyses in their  reviews, and many have formal processes for abstracting economic data,  assessing the quality and results of the studies, and incorporating cost  effectiveness into their decision making process.  Standards have continued to  advance, with insufficient data being the more limiting factor.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Below we describe the  methods and major contributions of U.S. preventive services advisory  committees, task forces, and federal regulatory agencies to improving standards  and best practices for economic analyses and modeling of preventive  interventions.  Their efforts demonstrate the progression of economic analyses  to aid preventive services and regulatory decision making—from standardization  of assumptions and data across studies to the ranking of selected or proposed  preventive health services.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Task Force on  Community Preventive Services. </i></b>To address problems of comparability  among the small number of economic evaluation studies in this field, the Task  Force on Community Preventive Services developed standardized methods and the  first set of instruments for conducting systematic reviews of economic  evaluations across community-health promotion and disease-prevention  interventions.  It recommends that economic analytic methods, including cost  analysis, cost-effectiveness (including cost-utility), or cost-benefit  analysis, are selected.  Data is then collected, abstracted, adjusted, and  summarized to improve the comparability of the studies’ results.  The reference  case of the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (PCEHM) is used  as the standard.  The standardized results are published in a summary table  that lists the main components of each study, adjustments made of the original  ratio, costs, or cost savings value, and an overall conclusion of the economic  benefit of the intervention (Carande-Kulis et al., 2000).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>U.S. Preventive  Services Task Force (USPSTF). </i></b>The third USPSTF initiated a process and  designed a tool for systematically reviewing cost-effectiveness analysis as an  aid in making recommendations about clinical preventive services (Saha et al.,  2001).  For a period, USPSTF reviewed CEAs only for those services with  relevant questions about cost effectiveness. Specific requirements for the use  of CEAs in its recommendation process included: conduct a systematic analysis  only when there is reasonable evidence that the intervention in question is  effective; include only studies that assess health outcomes (rather than  process outcomes); and use only those conducted from the societal perspective  and from the perspective of a general population. The current USPSTF policy is  that the Task Force does not consider economic costs in making recommendation  but does “search for evidence of the costs and cost-effectiveness of  implementation, presenting this information separately from its recommendation”  (USPSTF, 2008). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Advisory  Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Guidance for Health Economic  Studies Presented to ACIP. </i></b>In 2007, ACIP provided a framework and  guidance for the description and presentation of methods used to examine the  economics of a vaccine-related issue. The Committee requires justification of  all methodological assumptions, including time frame and analytic horizon, economic  model, health outcomes of interest, epidemiologic models, probabilities and  costs, discount rate (present value), and sensitivity analyses.  It does not,  however, provide specific guidance on what these assumptions should be and how  they should be computed.  The guidance also specifies how results should be  presented to the ACIP workgroup, CDC staff, and other reviewers.  ACIP and its  workgroups then use this information to make vaccine recommendations.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>National  Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP). </i></b>Since 1997, the National  Commission on Prevention Priorities (NCPP), organized by the Partnership for  Prevention, has produced rankings and presented underlying information to guide  priority setting for preventive services, initially clinical services, but  recently proposing a framework for community-based interventions that address a  variety of diseases, risk factors, and behaviors (Maciosek et al., 2006;  2009).  Although the Commission intends its framework to apply to both  community and clinical interventions, the most recent rankings (2006) evaluate  clinical preventive services recommended by the USPSTF, and immunizations  recommended by ACIP through December 2004.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The Commission’s guidance for extending the clinical  preventive services priority-setting framework to community-based services  addresses the range of services included in the exercise, prioritization  criteria and strategies, evidence review methods, and presentation of results  (2009). The Commission suggests that ratings and rankings it has used for  clinical preventive services, based on clinically preventable burden and cost  effectiveness, both measured as QALYs, can be used for community-based  interventions also.<span>P14F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" id="_ftnref15"><span><sup>[15]</sup></span></a><span>P</span>  However,  the Commission notes that the cost-effectiveness (CE) ratio by itself is a  reasonable priority-setting tool: “The CE ratio has intuitive appeal as a  priority-setting criterion. It indicates which intervention produces the  greatest gain in health at the lowest cost. … The numerator incorporates both  the costs of the intervention and the downstream savings, and the denominator  is, in effect, CPB [the clinical preventable burden]” (Maciosek, 2009, p.350).    </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance on Regulatory Analysis. </i></b>OMB has  issued a series of guidance documents to improve the economic analysis of  regulations to protect health and reduce mortality risks. Based on the 1993  Executive Order 12866, these guidances outline the analytic steps that OMB  expects agencies to follow, including information on best practices. The most  recent version of these guidelines was published in 2003, OMB Circular A-4, <i>Regulatory  Analysis</i>, after extensive public comment, interagency review, and  independent peer review. Circular<i> </i>A-4 characterizes “good” regulatory  analysis, as well as standardizing the way benefits and costs are measured and  reported in regulatory impact assessments. Figure 7 illustrates the general  process specified in the Circular.</p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">As illustrated in the Figure, Circular A-4 directs that both BCA and CEA  be conducted. Additionally, it specifies the following: </p>

<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Uncertainty should be addressed qualitatively and also in a  formal sensitivity analysis; if the regulation’s impact is greater than $1  billion annually, a probabilistic uncertainty analysis is required. </p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>NICE. </i></b> The  U.K.’s NICE Guideline Development Group (GDG) issues clinical guidelines, for  consideration by the National Health Service and local health trusts, based on  the best available evidence of both clinical and cost effectiveness (NICE,  2009). The agency directs that guideline recommendations be based on cost  effectiveness rather than on budgetary impact. NICE also conducts a separate  and parallel cost-impact analysis when the clinical guideline is under  consideration, to allow organizations to estimate implementation costs. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The NICE Guidelines  Manual states that “An economic analysis will be more useful if it is likely to  influence a recommendation, and if the health and financial consequences of the  recommendation are large. The value of an economic analysis thus depends on: </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>the overall ‘importance’ of the recommendation (which is a  function of the number of patients affected and the potential impact on costs  and health outcomes per patient)</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>the current extent of uncertainty over cost effectiveness, and  the likelihood that economic analysis will reduce this uncertainty.” </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">A  cost-effectiveness analysis is the preferred form of economic evaluation, using  QALYs as the effectiveness metric, if the data are sufficient. Table 3 notes  the standards for a reference case CEA that NICE specifies for both technology  appraisals and clinical guidelines. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">NICE has provisionally proposed using, to provide advice to public  health agencies and local health authorities, the following, three-step  approach to assessing the returns on investment generated by public health  interventions (NICE, 2011): easured in ‘natural’ units. (This and the  subsequent CEA would reflect the timing of the costs and benefits – and the  sectors in which they occur. </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>A cost–effectiveness analysis with the outcomes expressed in  QALYs, to allow comparisons across different program. This preliminary guidance  notes that CEAs are not always appropriate for a public health intervention and  other methods, such as BCA, may be used. </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>The information from the cost-consequence and cost-effectiveness  analyses would be made available to local decision-makers for them to combine  with implementation costs and other details, such as eligible population size  and the outcome of an assessment of local need, to help them to decide which  interventions are priorities. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Recently  the U.K. has given greater attention to the cost-effectiveness of public health  interventions and surveyed a number of reviews of their economic impact.  A  group based at the University of York, the Public Health Research Consortium,  identified several methodological challenges for evaluating the economic impact  of public health interventions: attribution of effects, because of the paucity  of controlled trials in public health interventions and the short duration of  studies; measuring and valuing outcomes; identifying intersectoral costs and  consequences; and incorporating equity considerations (Weatherly et al., 2009).  The Consortium’s study of the published reviews and their underlying studies  noted that “The existing empirical literature is very disappointing, offering  few insights on how to respond to these challenges…there is an urgent need both  for pilot studies and more methodological research. (p. 92)”</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>WHO.</i> </b>In <i>Making  Choices in Health: WHO Guide to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Methods for  generalized cost-effectiveness analysis</i>, Balthussen and colleagues (2003)  set out the principles and make the case for an approach to CEA that attempts  to overcome disparate methodological practices. <i>Generalized CEA (GCEA) </i>offers  an internationally applicable framework for assessing the costs and health  benefits of different interventions absent many variable local decision  constraints. The authors argue that “sectoral CEA should identify current  allocative inefficiencies as well as opportunities presented by new  interventions. For this reason, we propose a modification of the standard  IMC-[intervention-mix-constrained] CEA, lifting the constraint on the current  mix of interventions to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of all options,  including currently funded interventions (p.11).” </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Two propositions  highlight what is distinctive about GCEA. First, evaluate the costs and  benefits of a set of related (interactive) interventions against the comparator  of the <i>null set </i>of those same interventions. Second, present the results  of the analysis in a league table, as the initial step in a policy analysis.  Such an array would allow for very broad classification of “very cost-effective,”  “very cost-ineffective,” and intermediate interventions, with little  significance attached to differential cost-effectiveness ratios within the set  of “cost-effective” interventions. Notably, the WHO approach excludes averted  costs from the CE ratio. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">WHO specifies 14 epidemiological subregions globally for  estimating and reporting cost-effectiveness. This approach allows for the  application of GCEA by grouping countries (and the CEAs generated for them)  within similar health system and epidemiological contexts, and allowing the  conditions in the comparator state (the “null set counterfactual”) to be  identified. Health impacts are measured in DALYs. The authors emphasize that  the set of interrelated interventions that should be removed in the null set  counterfactual need not be every health service in local existence; it should,  however, include those services whose benefits and costs are overlapping or  interactive in some way—or are mutually exclusive.<span>P17F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="" id="_ftnref18"><span><sup>[18]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> For example, a GCEA of prevention, screening, and treatment of  colorectal cancer included within the set of interrelated interventions a full  range of screening modalities with various periodicities; medical treatments  for cancer; and a campaign to promote consumption of fruits and vegetables  (Ginsberg et al., 2010). Once the GCEA has identified the efficient mix of  interventions relative to the null set, the standard IMC-CEA should be used for  additional analysis, to inform how to move from the current mix of  interventions to the optimal mix.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b><i>An Economic  Framework for the Prevention of Chronic Diseases.</i></b> In a working paper  commissioned by OECD, Sassi and Hurst (2008) offer an economic framework for  considering whether and under what circumstances the prevention of chronic  diseases increases social welfare and improves health equity, relative to  treatment. They examine the pathways by which chronic diseases emerge,  particularly those with behavioral components, and attempt to determine where  failures of markets or rationality keep people from achieving the best health  outcomes, and where preventive interventions could improve efficiency and  equity.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The authors adopt a  benefit−cost framework at the broadest level, in view of the twin  objectives of improving both social welfare and the equitable distribution of  health across a population, and also because of the multiple sectors implicated  in the cause and prevention of lifestyle-related chronic diseases. In  particular, the framework considers whether and how individual choices in the  realm of diet, physical activity, smoking, and drinking involve failures of  information (ignorance of consequences), failure to capture externalities of  consumption (e.g., in unhealthy foods or education) in their private costs and  individual benefits, or failures of rationality (e.g., as with addictive  substances).  Sassi and Hurst (2008) propose combining BCA with CEA, in order  to make the assessment relevant to various decision and budget perspectives,  and to separately assess health equity by estimating changes in indicators of  health distribution.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The broad scope of this  analysis (prevention of any sort of chronic disease with a behavioral  component) and the welfare economic framework explicitly consider the achievement  of population health goals within the context of other constituents of social  welfare, and account for the opportunity costs of prevention efforts. The  authors suggest that “The chief contribution to be expected from economic  models of health production is…on specific health-related behaviours, particularly  in understanding how these contribute to the efficiency of health production  and what the interdependencies are between such behaviors and other important  health determinants (Sassi and Hurst, 2008, p.20).” They would have a model of  health production account for social and environmental influences; life-course  factors; general and health-specific education; and uncertainty, time  preferences and self-control. Important dimensions within which governments and  other actors concerned with developing prevention strategies should classify  and evaluate prevention alternatives include the area in which the intervention  will be undertaken and the specific health determinants that it is expected to  affect, to inform the design, implementation, and funding of the intervention.  Another important dimension is the degree to which the intervention interferes  with individual choices. Finally, the potential for targeting the intervention  should be considered, as the ability to target can potentially affect the efficiency,  equity implications, and political feasibility of undertaking the intervention.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In their 2008  discussion, Sassi and Hurst present their work as a guide for more specific  policy analyses. This high-level framework helps to identify at a conceptual  level the nature of various policy levers in the prevention arena and the kinds  of concerns and rationales for choosing among them that a public sector  decision maker might need to address.</p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">This section presents  and discusses economic evaluations grouped according to four health conditions  or service type. Because for this project it was not possible to review the  literature on preventive services models comprehensively, we limited the search  to topics of current policy relevance for which a number of recent economic  analyses had been conducted.  After reviewing the recommendations of the  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Preventive Services Task  Force, and the Community Preventive Services Task Force—and reviewing our  preliminary choices with ASPE—we selected screening mammography to prevent  breast cancer; immunization to prevent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection;  prevention and management of diabetes; and clinical and community-based  interventions to prevent obesity. These topics span primary, secondary and  tertiary preventive interventions, represent both clinical and community-based  services, and individual analyses represent several forms of analysis: cost of  illness, cost-effectiveness, return on investment, and benefit–cost.  Thus the  range of studies presented here allows for a number of different types of  comparisons and contrasts among data sources, model structure, and metrics  used.</p>

<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Key model  characteristics were abstracted from these articles. Model characteristics were  chosen prior to abstracting information and were revised according to their  suitability to the information presented or if they were deemed useful,  post-review. Most retrieved articles were cost-effectiveness analyses; we  specifically searched for studies using other model frameworks, such as  return-on-investment and benefit–cost analysis. We also identified studies in  reviewing national and international guidelines and studies, such as the  economic model developed for OECD to estimate the impact of interventions to  tackle overweight and obesity at the population level (Sassi et al., 2009).</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In order to exhibit  models for preventive services most relevant to the geographical region of this  project, we have made an effort to include several articles based in the United  States (where the literature review may have only yielded one or two US-based  articles).

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">We reviewed four recent  economic evaluations of breast cancer screening strategies, one conducted in  the U.S. and three in other countries (Spain, Hong Kong, and Japan), presented  and referenced in Table 5. Each of these was a CEA; all but one took the  perspective of a health care payer or the health care sector overall, and included  only direct medical care costs. All four measured either life years extended or  QALYs gained, or both. The focus of each of the studies was to ascertain the  cost-effectiveness, at least in comparison to no screening, of different  periodicities and starting and stopping ages for screening mammography. In the  case of the Japanese study, annual clinical breast exam was modeled as an  alternative and concurrent intervention. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">These studies,  published between 2006 and 2011, reveal considerable consistency in model  structure (dynamic, Markov chains) and stipulated parameters, such as discount  rate, while specific health states and transition paths differed across the  studies, both by choice and due to data limitations. For example, the U.S.  study, which included multiple risk factors such as age, breast density,  previous family history, and prior biopsy in evaluating the cost effectiveness  of alternative age thresholds and intervals for screening, excluded women with  the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene from the model.  </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The relatively recent  introduction of both a quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) and a bivalent  (types 16 and 18) vaccine for human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, the  preponderant cause of cervical cancer, has led to a multitude of possible alternative  scenarios of combined immunization and screening interventions. The economic  evaluations of HPV and cervical cancer prevention strategies that have been  conducted over the past decade have become increasingly complex. Yet little is  known about the protection offered by the vaccines over the longer term, which  introduces considerable uncertainty into the models for optimizing clinical and  cost-effectiveness of mixed prevention strategies.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Table 6 presents  abstracted information from 10 CEAs published between 2003 and 2011. Six of the  analyses were conducted in the U.S. and one each in France, the Netherlands,  Brazil, and Great Britain. This set of studies helps to illustrate a variety of  context-specific factors, policy alternatives, and modeling choices in the  prevention of cervical cancer.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The non-U.S. studies,  for example, illustrate the significance of cervical cancer screening coverage  and periodicity in determining the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating  pre-adolescent girls against HPV types 16 and 18. Among the group of U.S.  studies, in contrast, the comparator, screening cytology, provides a consistent  backdrop. The British study by Jit and colleagues (2011) compares the  cost-effectiveness of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, including  benefits and costs of protection against non-cancer disease endpoints in  addition to cancers. Chesson and colleagues (2011) model alternative  immunization strategies for females between age 12 and 26 years, and of boys at  age 12, with the quadrivalent vaccine. All of the studies except for the  Brazilian population, which measured natural endpoints (cases of disease and  life expectancy) reported results that used QALYs. Note that the French and  Dutch studies use a lower discount rate for benefits than for costs to partially  counteract the occurrence of benefits many years into the future. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">In a review of models  of cervical cancer prevention in developed countries, Kim and colleagues note  that </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“countries with  well-established screening programs will need to consider the potential  avertable burden of disease relative to their <i>status quo</i>, the  uncertainty in duration of vaccine protection, the relative performance of new  screening strategies that utilize HPV DNA testing, the costs associated with  different cervical cancer prevention options, and the likelihood of  acceptability and uptake (Kim et al., 2008).”    </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">HPV immunization  interventions present particularly complex modeling challenges because of  epidemiological dynamics at the population level, the long lag time between the  intervention and the impact on disease, and the choice of two vaccines with  different protective characteristics. Further, the comparator (or complementary  intervention) to the immunization intervention can vary, depending on the  screening technology (two forms of cytology and HPV DNA testing, under certain  conditions). The review by Kim and colleagues (2008) discusses the kinds of  inputs that different types of models—static versus dynamic—require and the  nature of the information that they can produce. A dynamic model can, for  example, take account of patterns of sexual contact, infectiousness of HPV  type, and type-specific prevalence within the population. Key model assumptions  include vaccine efficacy and immunization coverage rates. Cost-effectiveness is  particularly sensitive to assumptions about the persistence or waning of  vaccine efficacy over time; published studies have documented the persistence  of protective effect for just under a decade, so this is a major source of  uncertainty in modeling results.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Today, with  immunization of pre-adolescent girls as the background policy, a full range of  alternative cervical cancer screening modalities, start ages for screening and  its periodicity can be explored (Goldhaber-Fiebert et al., 2008; Kim et al.,  2008).  </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Economic evaluations of  preventive strategies addressing the onset and progression of diabetes and  related illness encompass more diversity in analytic approaches, interventions,  and disease endpoints and outcomes than seen in the cancer screening and  immunization examples discussed so far. Table 7 summarizes nine recently  published studies that illustrate this wide ranging field. The studies range  from primary prevention (Johansson et al., 2009; Roux et al., 2010; Zhuo et  al., 2012), to secondary prevention (screening) (Bertram et al., 2010; Chatterjee  et al., 2010), to tertiary prevention (disease management) (Huang et al., 2009;  Klein et al., 2011; Mullen and Marr, 2010;), to a combination of primary and  secondary prevention (Herman et al., 2005).  The interventions studied range  from broad community-based physical activity interventions, to intensive diet  and activity (lifestyle) management, to pharmaceutical and medical  interventions, to bariatric surgery. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The most recent study (Zhuo et al., 2012), conducted with a  type 2 diabetes simulation model developed by CDC and RTI International,  modeled the impact of a targeted community-based lifestyle intervention program  for adults at high risk of developing diabetes over a 25-year period, from the  perspective of the  health care sector overall. The authors found that the  intervention was modestly cost-saving for all age groups over the period,  reaching a break-even point by the 14<span>P</span><sup>th</sup><span>P</span> year. The study’s sensitivity analysis revealed that the cost of  the intervention in the first two years largely drives the net cost impact of  the program. In contrast, a comprehensive state-transition Markov model (the  CDC Measurement of the Value of Exercise (MOVE) Model) that encompassed seven  community-based physical activity interventions and included five disease  outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, estimated a cost-effectiveness ratio of  $46,914/QALY for a 1-year individually adapted intensive lifestyle modification  for persons at high risk of developing diabetes over a lifetime (Roux et al.,  2008). Two studies (Bertram et al., 2010; Herman et al., 2005) reported the  cost-effectiveness of drug and lifestyle interventions (compared with no intervention)  over a lifetime. The U.S. and Australian studies reported similar results,  although the U.S. study (Herman et al., 2005) found the lifestyle intervention  more cost-effective relative to metformin than did the Australian study (in  which multiple drugs were included). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The study by Huang and  colleagues (2009) addresses evidence-based medical management of diabetes from  the federal health care budgetary perspective. It applies epidemiological  modeling to the projection of future direct, federal diabetes-care costs for  adults aged 24-85, with an intervention enrolling adults between 24 and 64,  comparing 10- and 25-year budget windows. The study demonstrates the  significance of following the population with this chronic condition for the  longer time period in order to register health care budgetary savings. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The two studies of bariatric surgery as an intervention to  reduce BMI in diabetes patients (Klein et al., 2011; Mullen and Marr, 2010)  take the perspective of the health care payer, and are structured as an ROI or  BCA. Both studies of this highly targeted, expensive intervention, which were  conducted over 9 and 7.5 years, respectively, reported that surgical costs had  been recouped through lower medical care costs as compared with non-surgical  matched cohorts from the plan within 2.2 or 3.5 years, depending on study and  type of surgery.<span>P18F</span><a href="../sp/reports/2013/EconomicModels/rpt_EconomicModels.cfm.html#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="" id="_ftnref19"><span><sup>[19]</sup></span></a><span>P</span> </p>

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Economic assessments of  clinical or community-based interventions to affect the development or  treatment of obesity can be in many respects similar to those of interventions for  the prevention or management of type 2 diabetes. Weight loss or BMI is typically  an intermediate outcome in the analysis of diabetes interventions. For example,  Roux and colleagues (2008), in the analysis of physical activity interventions  discussed above, explicitly focused on particular disease endpoints, with  weight loss or BMI as an implicit mechanism, to avoid double-counting impact. Conversely,  <i>in the models of the economic impact of obesity-related interventions,  specific disease endpoints</i> (type 2 diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular events,  and conditions) frequently account for the estimated cost savings for  reductions in obesity. Table 8 summarizes six recent analyses. One of these  (Finkelstein et al., 2008) estimates lifetime medical cost burden as a function  of BMI class. Two are policy-oriented models assessing and comparing multiple  clinical and community-based strategies to prevent or reduce obesity for  European countries (Sassi et al., 2009) and Australia (Carter et al., 2009).  The  other three include a RoI model for workplace weight loss interventions  (Trogdon et al., 2009); a one-year analysis of a school-based physical activity  intervention (Wang et al., 2008); and a British study of weight management  within primary care settings (Haynes et al., 2010). </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The Trogdon article  reports on the development of a workplace obesity intervention model that  simulates ROI based on specific businesses’ workforce and intervention  characteristics. This model is now available on the CDC website as “LEAN <i>Works</i>:  Obesity Cost Calculator.” The model relies on a prevalence-based approach to  translate weight loss (in BMI units) into expected changes in medical spending  and absenteeism. The CDC online calculator allows for the substitution of  default values for many of the employer-specific characteristics if that  information is missing. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Wang and colleagues  report the first-year experience of an after-school physical activity program  in lieu of regular after-school care, randomizing 18 elementary schools within  one state into nine intervention and nine control sites. The early results of  the intervention suggest that students who attended the  physical-activity-enriched after school program at least 2 days per week (40%  of the time) achieved a percentage reduction in body fat of 0.76 at an  additional cost of $317 per student. The clinical significance of a one-percent  reduction in body fat, however, has not been established.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Finkelstein and  colleagues (2008) present their model for estimating the lifetime medical cost  burden of overweight and obesity as an improvement over previous studies that  relied on attributable fraction approaches, which include a limited number of  diseases and do not account for confounding and interactions among co-present  diseases. Notably, this 2008 study distinguishes overweight and two classes of  obesity, and estimates excess remaining lifetime medical expenditures at two  ages (20 and 65 years), for four subpopulations (white and black men and white  and black women). This structure reveals distinctive patterns of lifetime costs  by gender, race and BMI class. Because of the inverse relationship between  survival and obesity, the difference in lifetime costs for those in the lower  and those in the higher obesity classes is less than reported by the same lead  author in an earlier, cross-sectional analysis.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Haynes and colleagues  (2010) use the 2006 NICE obesity health economic model to evaluate costs and  outcomes associated with weight gain for three conditions: type 2 diabetes,  coronary heart disease, and colon cancer. The NICE individual-level model  generates a simulated population representative of the UK population, followed  over a lifetime, with health status and health resource consumption depending  on age, gender, and BMI. The evidence-based intervention of practice nurse or  other health care worker guided by ‘weight management advisors’ had  demonstrated an average 3kg weight loss at 1 year, for the 45 percent of the  original participants reporting back, and this was the base case scenario used  in the model, with weight assumed to be regained over the following two years,  and then returning to the general expected trajectory. In a number of scenarios  the model projected that the one-time intervention was cost-saving, and in  others had a cost-effectiveness of between £2000 and £2700 per QALY. Mortality  impacts were not included.  </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Both Sassi and  colleagues and Carter and colleagues report on models encompassing a wide range  of clinical and community-based interventions that address obesity. The OECD  working paper (Sassi et al., 2009) assesses the efficiency and distributional  impact of interventions to prevent chronic diseases associated with unhealthy  diets and sedentary lifestyles. It employs the Chronic Disease Prevention model  (CDP), a stochastic microsimulation model, jointly developed by the OECD and  WHO. The model can be used to represent a variety of populations and their  distinctive characteristics; this set of analyses represents the region of  Europe and the costs represent average conditions across the countries making  up the region. The CDP uses a <i>causal web</i> of behavioral risk factors for  selected conditions. The notion of a causal web allows for more or less  immediate influences on the occurrence of disease; risk factors can also  influence other risk factors in the same or a different disease pathway. The  dietary, physical activity, and combined interventions fall into the broad  categories of community-based counseling; counseling in primary care practices;  school-based; environmental modification; and other (e.g., media campaigns).  The authors modeled the impact of a number of different groupings of  interventions, aimed at different ages and mixing broad-based and targeted  strategies. The health impacts and cost impacts of the different collections of  interventions are shown separately and graphed as cost-effectiveness ratios  over time. Outcomes were measured as DALYs. All interventions had favorable  cost-effectiveness ratios and some interventions were cost-saving. This  analysis is unique among CEAs reviewed for including information on  socioeconomic distributional impact. The authors note that “inequalities in age  at death appear to be reduced only to a small extent, whereas the extent to which  inequalities between socioeconomic groups may be reduced depends crucially on  possible differences in the effectiveness of interventions between the relevant  groups [and the model assumes equal effectiveness across groups] (p. 58).”</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Assessing Cost-Effectiveness in Obesity (ACE-Obesity) is the  title of an overarching initiative of the Victorian Department of Human  Services, Australia, begun in 2004, to provide state and national policy makers  with the “best available modelled evidence on the effectiveness and  cost-effectiveness of selected obesity prevention interventions, particularly  amongst children and adolescents (Carter et al., 2009, p.2).” Thirteen  interventions, ranging from after-school activity programs to reductions of TV  advertising of high-fat and high-sugar foods to gastric banding for morbidly  obese adolescents were analyzed within a common evaluation design frame and  cost-inclusion protocols (e.g., in all cases productivity gains/losses were  excluded; time costs for adults/carers were included). Cost-effectiveness  ratios are expressed as the Australian dollar cost/DALY saved, with and without  offsetting out-year medical cost reductions attributed to the reduction in BMI  due to the intervention. <i>Uncertainty testing</i> of the technical parameters  (e.g., economic and epidemiological inputs—which the authors distinguish from <i>sensitivity  analysis</i> of key programmatic design features—was conducted with simulation  modeling with probability distributions around the input variables based on  standard errors or the range of values found in the literature. Finally, the  ACE approach, which has also been applied for heart disease, cancer, and mental  health, includes a <i>2</i><span>P</span><i><sup>nd</sup></i><span>P</span><i> stage filter</i> that considers the degree of confidence in  the model results and broader issues affecting resource allocation decisions.  In this case, the criteria used to review results included equity, strength of  evidence, feasibility of implementation, acceptability to stakeholders,  sustainability, and potential for side effects. </p>

In the 30% coverage scenario, the cost per QALY gained by adding    male vaccination was $121,700 when including only cervical outcomes and    $41,400 when including all health outcomes even if the increased female vaccination    strategy incurred program costs of $350 per additional girl vaccinated.</p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB"> </p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination depended on    vaccine coverage of females. When including all HPV-associated outcomes in    the analysis, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)    gained by adding male vaccination to a female-only vaccination program was    $23,600 in the lower female coverage scenario (20% coverage at age 12 years)    and $184,300 in the higher female coverage scenario (75% coverage at age 12 years).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">Under base-case parameter values, the estimated cost    per QALY gained by vaccination in the context of current cervical cancer    screening practices in the United States ranged from $3,906 to $14,723 (2005    US dollars), depending on factors such as whether herd immunity effects were    assumed; the types of HPV targeted by the vaccine; and whether the benefits    of preventing anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers were included.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">The ICER of augmenting this strategy with a temporary    catch-up program for 12- to 24-year-olds was US $4,666 per QALY. Relative to    other commonly accepted healthcare programs, vaccinating girls and women    appears cost-effective. Including men and boys in the program was the most    effective strategy, reducing the incidence of genital warts, cervical    intraepithelial neoplasia, and cervical cancer by 97%, 91%, and 91%,    respectively. The ICER of this strategy was $45,056 per QALY.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">The most effective strategy had an ICER of $58,500 per    quality adjusted life year, which is combining vaccination at age 12 years    with triennial conventional cytologic screening beginning at age 25 years,    compared with the next best strategy of vaccination and cytologic screening    every 5 years beginning at age 21 years.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">A vaccine with a 75% probability of immunity against    high-risk HPV infection resulted in a life expectancy gain of 2.8 days or 4.0    quality-adjusted life days at a cost of $246 relative to current practice    (incremental cost-effectiveness of $22,755/QALY). If all 12-year-old girls    currently living in the United States were vaccinated &gt;1,300 deaths from    cervical cancer would be averted during their lifetimes. Vaccination of girls    against high-risk HPV is relatively cost effective even when vaccine efficacy    is low. If the vaccine efficacy rate is 35%, the cost effectiveness increases    to $52,398/QALY.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">Vaccination only or adding vaccination to screening    conducted every 3 and 5 years was not cost-effective. However, at more    frequent screening intervals, strategies combining vaccination and screening were    preferred. Vaccination plus biennial screening delayed until age 24 years had    the most attractive cost-effectiveness ratio ($44,889 per life-year gained)    compared with screening only beginning at age 18 years and conducted every 3    years. However, the strategy of vaccination with annual screening beginning    at age 18 years had the largest overall reduction in cancer incidence and    mortality at a cost of $236,250 per life-year gained compared with    vaccination and annual screening beginning at age 22 years.</p>

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of quadrivalent    vaccination (compared with no vaccination) ranges from £12 000 (£11 000–£14    000) to £19000 (£17 000–£22 000) when protection against anal, penile, and    oropharyngeal cancers is assumed, and up to £22 000 (£19000–£25 000) when    only protection against licensed end points is assumed. The incremental cost    effectiveness ratio of bivalent vaccination (compared with no vaccination)    ranges from £16000 (£14 000–£18 000) to £25 000 (£21 000–£28 000) with    protection against all cancer end points, and up to £41 000 (£34000–£45 000)    with protection against licensed end points only. Hence when making    pessimistic assumptions about duration of protection and range of end points    prevented, bivalent vaccination may not be cost effective at £84.50 per dose.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">The discounted costs per QALY were € 19,500/QALY    (range € 11,000 to € 25,000/QALY) and lied near the cost-effectiveness    threshold of €20,000/QALY used in The Netherlands. Cost-effectiveness was    stable, but was most sensitive to the discount rate used for costs and    benefits.</p>

<p class="NORCTableTextB">The incremental cost-effectiveness from screening plus    vaccination versus screening along was €12,429 per life-year gained    (third-party payer perspective {TPP})and €20,455 per life-year gained (direct    healthcare cost perspective {DCP}); and €8,408 per QALYs (TPP) and €13,809    per QALY (DCP).</p>

<p class="NORCTableTextB">The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of    vaccination and screening (a two-visit HPV) is I$700-9,600 per year of life    saved (YLS) depending of the cost of vaccination.</p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB"> </p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">Provided the cost per vaccinated woman was equal to,    or below I$ 50, screening three times per lifetime alone was dominated by    vaccination alone. When the cost per vaccinated woman was I$ 25, vaccination    alone was cost saving compared to no intervention, and vaccination plus    screening (at ages 35, 40 and 45) ranged from I$ 200 to I$ 700 per YLS,    depending on the choice of screening test.</p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB"> </p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">When the cost per vaccinated woman was I$ 50,    vaccination alone was I$ 300 per YLS, compared to no intervention. As the    cost per vaccinated woman exceeded I$ 75, screening alone (with two-visit HPV    DNA testing) was no longer dominated by vaccination alone, and had an    incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of I$ 500 per YLS, compared to    nonintervention. At all vaccine costs above I$ 75, vaccination plus screening    (at ages 35, 40 and 45) dominated vaccination alone, although the incremental    cost-effectiveness ratio rose with higher vaccine costs.</p>

<p class="NORCTableTextB">Limited data on disease parameters and HPV types</p>
</td>

<p class="NORCTableTextB">Women may be less likely to be screened if they have    been vaccinated - suggest an education campaign for continued screening    despite vaccination; choice of discount rate (same discount rate for both    costs and benefits penalize preventive interventions relative to treatment    interventions)</p>

Cost savings associated with surgery started accruing at    month 3. Total surgery costs were fully recovered on average after 30 months    in 1999–2007 for all types of surgeries; after 29 months for open surgeries    in 2004–2007;and after 26 months for laparoscopic surgeries in 2004–2007.</p>

<p class="NORCTableTextB">The inflation adjusted mean per member per year total    paid decreased by $1,895 in the fifth year after surgery. The mean costs for    gastric bypass patients were lower within the first year after surgery than    their preoperative costs. At 3.5 years after surgery, the surgical costs had    been recouped for patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery, and by year 2,    they had incurred fewer costs than the obese health plan population.</p>

<p class="NORCTableTextB">Assuming 70% specificity screening cutoffs, Medicare    costs for testing, retail costs for generic metformin, and costs for false    negatives as 10% of reported costs associated with pre-diabetes/diabetes,    health system costs over 3 years for the different screening tests would be    GCT-pl $180,635; GCT-cap $182,980; RPG $182,780; RCG $186,090; and A1C    $192,261; all lower than costs for no screening, which would be $205,966. </p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB"> </p>
<p class="NORCTableTextB">Under varying assumptions, projected health system    costs for screening and treatment with metformin or lifestyle modification    would be less than costs for no screening as long as disease prevalence is at    least 70% of that of our population and false-negative costs are at least 10%    of disease costs. Societal costs would equal or exceed costs of no screening    depending on treatment type.</p>

Compared with    the control area, the cost increases and QALY losses for women were more    favorable in two program areas but less favorable in one, and less favorable    for men in both areas (data unavailable for one municipality).

</div>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">This literature review  and environmental scan has considered economic models available for the  estimation of the benefits of preventive interventions—understanding “models”  in terms of very broad types of analytic frameworks employed in the economic  evaluation of health-related interventions. It has also considered the needs  and constraints of public-sector analysts in applying the results of economic  models. Here we present issues and questions in the economic modeling of  prevention benefits considered by the expert panel convened at NORC offices in  Bethesda, MD, on April 17, 2012. This outline anticipates ongoing work to  articulate options and alternatives for HHS both in model construction and for  future research.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Much of the work to  date in developing models for the economic evaluation of preventive  interventions has directly followed the standards for CEA set out in the 1996  report of the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (Gold et al.),  which dictates a reference case analysis from the <i>societal </i>perspective.  However, in order to address the concerns and questions of federal policy  makers—and the budget analysts and actuarial staff that support them—both the  data and modeling infrastructures for programmatic and health-sector impacts  need focused attention and development for policy applications. Although  federal regulatory impact analysis is predominantly BCA, and BCA is used by the  legislative review agency in Washington State (Washington State Institute of  Public Policy (WSIPP)) to evaluate social policies, CEA remains the leading  analytic framework for health care services and public health interventions.  Thus our preliminary observations and suggestions for further work in modeling  the benefits of prevention primarily refer to practices in CEA. </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The following outlines  a preliminary set of topics based on the models reviewed and discussions held  to date for subsequent development. The expert panel addressed the following overarching  questions:</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Are there ways to make the different perspectives employed in  various contexts (regulatory impact assessment, CBO projections, and HHS  budgetary analysis) more transparent so that people understand why they can  yield different results? </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>What strategies can we develop to improve the transparency of  models and their findings?</p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>How can best-practice modeling techniques be used by public  sector estimators to provide more rigorous projections of both the clinical and  spending impact of prevention efforts?  </p>
<p class="NORCBullet1TimesNewRomanSquare"><span>■<span>        </span></span>Can these models provide the kind of outputs necessary for  federal level cost estimates in both the legislative and executive branches?  </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph"><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">One of the outcomes of  the expert panel meeting was a general acknowledgment of the need for simple  tools, criteria, questions, and metrics for the audiences of models to employ  in evaluating the models. Despite the various perspectives and traditions  followed by different modelers, a common set of standards by which to  communicate assumptions and methods would improve transparency and  understanding.</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">The following are more  specific issues that the expert panel considered: </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b>Data for modeling  prevention benefits.  </b>Most trials or evaluations are of limited time scope,  which do not capture the participants’ health status and utilization prior to  the intervention or after the intervention is over.  What can be done to  provide a more comprehensive time perspective? Should clinical trials include  several years of follow-up data collection? Might clinical trials be designed  such that the health care claims experience of participants would be collected  and analyzed for a specific period of time (e.g., two years) prior to the  intervention and after the trial ends?</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Both traditional  clinical trials and pilot or demonstration community-based interventions  evidence selection effects.  Often the study population is chosen for their  clinical profile (e.g., absence of comorbidities) or their willingness to  participate.  This introduces at least some level of selection bias and can  complicate the ability of modelers to project the trial or intervention  population to broader populations such as all Medicare beneficiaries or the  U.S. population overall. A related problem is the under- representation of key  policy subpopulations, such as underserved or economically disadvantaged  communities, seniors, or children. How can study populations be selected to be  representative of the broader population the policy may cover? Can more  representative trial/intervention populations be developed?</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Academic modelers rely  on peer-reviewed sources for price data, whereas federal modelers rely on  publicly documented sources such as Medicare payment rates. How are prices  estimated where there is neither a peer-reviewed source nor a public rate  schedule (e.g., community-based anti-obesity programs)? What inflation rates  should be used? When is the consumer price index (CPI) appropriate, the medical  care component of the CPI, versus the gross domestic product (GDP) deflator? </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">How should economic  models of preventive interventions address the effects on labor force  participation, such as absenteeism, presenteeism, lifetime earnings impacts,  retirement decisions, and participation in public income support and social  services programs? </p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman"><b>Modeling prevention  benefits. </b>What are the appropriate time horizons and budget windows for  economic models of preventive interventions? What discount rates should apply?  Should health benefits far in the future be discounted at the same rate as  monetary costs? How should health benefits, including health-related quality of  life (HRQL) be measured and expressed? Should preference-weighted HRQL metrics  become part of the calculations in policy models?</p>
<p class="NORCProposalBodySingleSpacing12ptTimesNewRoman">Can traditional  academic models produce and report outcomes that are useful in policy contexts  (e.g., in terms of time horizons, discounting practices, measurement and  valuation of health states)? Have any new areas of consensus (or disagreements)  in the conduct of cost-effectiveness analysis emerged since the 1996 U.S. Panel  on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine report? Has the methodology become  more sophisticated to address current limitations? How have or might variation  in health state valuations by age or current health condition be addressed? Is any  consensus on the treatment of time costs developing? </p>
