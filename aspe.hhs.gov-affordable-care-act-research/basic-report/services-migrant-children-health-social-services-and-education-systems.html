    <h2>Services For Migrant Children in the Health, Social  Services, and Education Systems.</h2>
<p>Nancy M. Pindus, Fran E. O'Reilly, Margaret Schulte, and  Lenore Webb</p>
<p>The Urban Institute</p>
<p>March, 1993</p>
<p><i>This study was prepared for the Department of Health  and Human Services under Contract No. HHS-100-92-0005,  Delivery Order No.1.  The Delivery Order Officer is Ms.  Susan Goodman, Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation.</i></p>
<hr /><h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In addition to the many burdens imposed on all children  of poverty, migrant children face mobility, language, and  cultural barriers.  Thus, the children of migrant  farmworkers--generally defined as persons who cross a  prescribed geographic boundary and stay away from their  normal residences overnight to perform farmwork for  wages--face increased challenges in obtaining educational,  health, and social services.  The purpose of this study is  to identify the needs of migrant children, to examine how  these needs are being met in selected sites, and to identify  successful models of service integration that might be more  widely adopted.  As our population becomes more  multicultural and multiethnic, programs that have been  successful in serving migrant farmworkers may be instructive  to other service providers and program planners who must  learn how to overcome language and cultural barriers.</p>
<h4>Project Objectives </h4>
<p>This project, carried out from June 1992 to February  1993, aims to meet the following objectives: </p>
<ul><li> Identify six exemplary programs for migrant children  that are successfully integrating two or more services;   </li>
<li> Identify factors that facilitate integration both at  the program,  local agency, and community levels and at the  state and federal levels;   </li>
<li> Identify gaps in services at the sites studied;   </li>
<li> Identify barriers to successful, comprehensive service  delivery for migrant children; and   </li>
<li> Identify research and evaluation issues for the  future.  </li>
</ul><h4>Sites Selected</h4>
<p>Sites were selected to represent a range of factors,  including geographic location, programs involved in the  service integration effort, ages of the children served, and  grower involvement or </p>
<p>support.  To be selected, the site had to be  successfully integrating two services (e.g., health and </p>
<p>education, health and social services, education and  social services).  The six sites selected were:</p>
<ul><li> Brockport, New York (Monroe County);  </li>
<li> Greeley, Colorado (Weld County);  </li>
<li> Stockton, California (San Joaquin County);  </li>
<li>  Woodburn, Oregon (Marion County);  </li>
<li> McAllen, Texas (Hidalgo County);  </li>
<li> Belle Glade, Florida (Palm Beach and Hendry Counties).  </li>
</ul><p>Site visits were conducted by two-person teams, and  included interviews with representatives of key programs  serving migrants, as well as a variety of community  agencies.  Managers as well as service providers were  interviewed during the three-day visits.  Visits also  included on-site observations of program operations, tours  of migrant housing facilities, attendance at parent or  community meetings, and informal discussions with migrant  students and parents.  Detailed case studies of each site  are available upon request.</p>
<h4>Operational Definition and Conceptual Framework</h4>
<p>The term "service integration" is widely used  today to describe the way services should be provided for a  wide range of groups with multiple service needs, including  children with disabilities, the mentally ill, at-risk youth,  and the homeless.   Migrant farmworker families have  multiple service needs, many of which have reached a  critical level.  Meeting the educational, social service,  and health needs of this population can be facilitated by  service integration.  Treating one problem while ignoring  others may be ineffective.  Examples range from placement of  a parent in a job training program when there is no access  to child care, to treating a child for a gastrointestinal  disorder but not addressing the problem of contaminated  drinking water in the camp where she lives (National Migrant  Resource Program 1992).  Each of the sites  visited stressed  the importance of focusing on the family unit in order to  effectively address the needs of children and adults.  </p>
<p>We view the implementation of system integration as a  continuum, characterized at one end by a fragmented system  that addresses specific needs of the clients without an  overall assessment, moving toward coordination of services  for the client, with the ultimate goal of integrated  service.  From the client's point of view, the ideal  integrated system would be perceived as one program or  system, even if the services are not all located in one  place.  From the service provider's standpoint, the ideal  integrated system provides for an overall assessment of the  client's needs and the necessary knowledge and relationships  established to assure that clients receive the services they  need, regardless of which community agency offers the  services. </p>
<p>A graphic presentation of our integrated service model  is presented on the following page.  It shows that there are  many types of services and a great number of organizations  to consider in serving clients with multiple needs.  The  migrant family is at the center of this model, surrounded by  the major programs specifically established to address the  needs of migrant farmworkers and their families.  In each  community, there are a number of other services, providers,  and community groups which assist migrants.  Finally, the  service integration configuration in each community is  shaped by its economic, physical, political, and cultural  environment.  Integration is an ongoing process, and even  communities that demonstrate successful service integration  still strive to encompass more services in their network.   This study presents three scenarios to describe ideal types  of service delivery systems:  services for the preschool  child (centered around Migrant Head Start); services for the  elementary school child (centered around Migrant Education);  and services for the high school age child (centered around  Migrant Education and JTPA).  For each age and program,  service integration for migrants must also address intra-  and interstate coordination to assure continuity as families  move for farm employment during the growing season and  return to their homes in the winter months. </p>
<p>Some of the case- or service-level strategies to foster  service integration observed in our study include:</p>
<ul><li> The use of case managers and migrant  coordinators/advocates;  </li>
<li> Co-location/on-site services;  </li>
<li> Extended hours so that access to programs can be  better coordinated;  </li>
<li> Transportation;  </li>
<li> Portable records;  </li>
<li> Culturally relevant programs in order to increase  acceptance of a wide range of services and providers;  </li>
<li> Translation services, which improve access to more  programs;  </li>
<li> Joint sponsorship of community functions such as  health fairs and cultural festivals;  </li>
<li> Home visits which address family needs for a wide  variety of services; and  </li>
<li> Coordinated outreach.  </li>
</ul><p>System or administrative strategies identified in the  communities visited for this study include:</p>
<ul><li> Interagency coalitions;  </li>
<li> Written agreements or memoranda of understanding  between agencies or providers;   </li>
<li> Regionalization/umbrella organizations;  </li>
<li> Participation on boards of other community  organizations; and  </li>
<li> Joint fundraising activities.   </li>
</ul><p><b>Promising Models</b><b>--Selected Examples</b></p>
<p>The site visits in this study were to communities  identified as having exemplary programs for service  integration for migrant children <i>of all ages  </i>.  Thus, by definition the site visits did not involve   visits to single programs, but included interviews with many  different community agencies.  Across the six sites visited,  a number of models of service integration were identified  that could be adopted by other sites interested in improving  coordinated service delivery.   Selected examples are  described below.</p>
<h4>Regional Coordination/Umbrella Organizations </h4>
<p>For Head Start children who migrate along the east coast  of the United States, the process of coordination among  programs is greatly facilitated by the East Coast Migrant  Head Start Project (ECMHSP).  ECMHSP is an umbrella  organization that provides fiscal and administrative  services to Head Start delegate agencies in 12 east coast  states.  A primary goal of the project is to promote  continuity of Head Start services to migrant children and  their families along the east coast of the United States.   ECMHSP provides program and fiscal monitoring and training  and technical assistance at the center level and promotes  staff development activities on a regular basis.  This  umbrella organization enables sites to serve families and  teach children, while the central office takes on  administrative tasks such as payroll, purchasing,  negotiating for space or resources, and arranging training  for staff.  ECMHSP also facilitates continuity as families  move from one site to another through a continuity record  provided to parents.  Each Head Start program that is a part  of ECMHSP uses the same forms to provide health and  developmental records that parents can take with them when  they travel.  Student records are also sent to the main  office of ECMHSP in Arlington, Virginia so that any other  ECMHSP center can request the file if the family does not  have it upon arrival.  Other administrative records are also  standardized across programs, as is an annual program  evaluation procedure.</p>
<h4>Community Coalitions</h4>
<p>Some community coalitions are attempting to assess the  overall needs of their communities and plan together for  meeting those needs.  </p>
<p><i>The Coalition of Migrant and Farmworker Services</i>,  a coalition of agencies that serve farmworkers, was started  in Brockport, New York in the late 1970s.  Its focus, then  and now, is on coordination.  Agencies in this coalition  include:  Brockport Migrant Education, Oak Orchard Community  Health Center, Agri-Business Child Development, Foodlink (a  food distribution program), the local office of the New York  State Department of Labor, the Hispanic Migrant Ministry,  and Rural Opportunities, Inc.  This is the forum where  providers can bring up gaps in services.  The "Working  Together Group," which is an outgrowth of this  coalition, has been meeting for about three years and takes  a structured, head-on, approach to resolving philosophical  differences.  For example, the group hired a paid  facilitator to work with them to help develop trust among  the various individuals and organizations represented. </p>
<p>The impact of these efforts in Brockport has been seen  across all services.  Members of the "Working Together  Group" have collaborated on grant proposals, staff  training, and parent education.  Members of these  organizations serve on the boards of directors of other  organizations in the coalition.  Each program indicates that  it has gained an understanding of the missions and  limitations of the other agencies.  </p>
<p><b><i>Relationships with Colleges and Universities and  Other Educational Institutions</i></b></p>
<p>Across sites there were a number of models observed in  which the various programs or agencies serving migrant  farmworkers and their families had developed special  relationships with local colleges and universities that  enabled them to either expand their programs, or somehow  capitalize on the resources of the colleges and  universities.  A commonly observed practice in the sites  visited was a well-developed relationship between the health  centers serving migrant families and nearby medical schools.    </p>
<p>A different arrangement was seen in the Brockport, New  York site, where the Migrant Education Program has been  located on the campus of the State University of New York  (SUNY) at Brockport since 1974.  That year the New York  State Department of Education established centralized  outreach centers throughout the state that were based at  state universities or other regionally based local education  agencies.  The Migrant Education Program in Brockport runs  both summer and year-round programs for migrants on the SUNY  Brockport campus.  The college campus setting for the  program benefits both the Migrant Education Program and SUNY  Brockport.  The college provides office, resource/library,  and classroom space in addition to four vans to transport  students to and from the night school.  The campus setting  exposes migrant students to higher education and life on a  college campus.  The setting also facilitates the use of  college students such as work/study students, student  teachers, and those participating in the Literacy Corps as  tutors.  Benefits for the college include placements for  student teachers and education administration interns, as  well as a wide range of opportunities for those interested  in using and practicing Spanish, studying alternative  approaches to education, and learning concepts of  multicultural education. </p>
<h4>Grower Support</h4>
<p>Very limited examples of grower support in providing and  improving accessibility and integration of services were  observed in the six sites visited.  The most notable example  occurred in Florida at the Shannon Center, a Migrant Head  Start center located on the property of A. Duda and Sons  (DUDA), one of the large growers in the area.  This center  serves 100 children, most of whom are infants and toddlers.   The parents of most of the children served by the Shannon  Center work for DUDA, although children of other migrant  families in the community are also eligible to be served  there.  Families return to work for DUDA each season because  of the benefits provided by this grower.  As a result, 80  percent of the families at the Shannon Center return each  year.  Partly because of this return rate, parents are very  involved in the center, helping out in the classrooms and  with repairs when time is available.  For example, parents  raised money to build a paved path in the playground area  for riding toys. </p>
<p>The creation of the Shannon Center was a joint effort by  the DUDA employee relations manager and staff of the East  Coast Migrant Head Start Project (ECMHSP).  The Center  offers advantages for both growers and families.   Parents  can drop off and pick up their children on their way to and  from work, thus improving worker satisfaction and  punctuality; and the site is convenient for parent meetings,  since it is close to where families live.  The employee  relations manager indicates that this arrangement has  eliminated travel and babysitting problems for workers.   DUDA provides all maintenance and security for the site.   </p>
<h4>Farmworker Housing</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most pressing problem identified by  respondents in the sites visited was a lack of affordable,  quality housing for migrant farmworkers and their families.   A number of efforts were identified to provide housing to  this population in a manner that also enabled integration of  services by providing space for co-location of services with  housing units.  One example of such an effort has been in  place in California since 1966, when the Housing Authority  of the County of San Joaquin began providing housing for  migrant farmworkers in response to squalid living conditions  among migrant families.  The Housing Authority manages,  owns, or leases approximately 5,000 rental units throughout  the county for migrants and other agricultural workers and  low-income families.  The state regulates the conditions of  operation for the housing centers and negotiates with the  Authority for rehabilitation and repair of the units.  The  housing for migrant farmworkers is subsidized by the State  Office of Migrant Services, which contracts with housing  centers across the state.  Rental housing units in the San  Joaquin Valley are provided to 288 migrant families at three  state-owned centers, which are open 180 days per  year--usually from May to October, depending on the growing  season in a given area.  Funding also comes from HUD, FHA,  and rent from tenants.  The Housing Authority also provides  space on the premises of the migrant housing camps to  various agencies that serve migrant families, including Head  Start, state-funded daycare programs, Girl Scouts, and  agencies providing GED or ESL classes.    </p>
<h4>Interstate Coordination</h4>
<p>Continuity of services for migrant families is a primary  concern as families move across state lines where different  types of programs and services are available.  The issue is  particularly acute for children in the education system,  where curriculum and graduation requirements vary from  system to system.  </p>
<p>Migrant education staff in the Stockton County,  California area have taken a  unique  approach to the need  for information to facilitate program continuity.  Since  most of their students migrate to and from Mexico, they  negotiated a binational agreement with Mexico that provides  written documentation (in both English and Spanish) of  students' current educational status.  The document provides  summary information on the student's, level in school and  academic information, including specific objectives by  subject area.  A grade point average is also provided, as is  a space for teacher comments.  The written document also  helps students gain entrance into school in Mexico.  School  officials in Colorado have recently begun similar work to  develop a binational accreditation project with Mexico.   </p>
<p>The Texas Migrant Interstate Program (TMIP) has an  extensive program of interstate communications for older  children (in grades 7-12).  TMIP sends staff to New York,  Washington, Georgia, and Michigan (and sometimes Ohio and  Indiana) to work with staff in other states and with  students from Texas.  A Program Coordination Center at Texas  A &amp; I University pays for sending staff to other states.   TMIP maintains a consultant pool for this purpose that  includes counselors and teachers who are willing to travel  to other states.  Respondents at the Brockport, New York  site reported that they had worked extensively with Texas  staff over the past 8 to 10 years.  They have worked out an  arrangement where Texas schools now accept New York's  recommendations for secondary school credit transfers.  They  have paid for counselors from Texas to spend 6 weeks in the  state to review student records, and are investigating ways  to work with Texas personnel on the issue of a required  standardized test for secondary students--the Texas  Assessment of Academic Skills.</p>
<h4>Promotores/Lay Educators</h4>
<p>The <i>promotores</i> model, providing training to  residents of the <i>colonias  </i> who then serve as lay educators and organizers in their  communities, has been implemented successfully in Hidalgo  County, Texas by both Planned Parenthood and the Expanded  Food and Nutrition Program.   The lay educators are  well-received in their communities, thus providing an  effective means of educating residents.  The <i>promotores  </i>model is an example of service integration because it  taps various community resources for training and program  implementation, and attempts to address a wide range of  needs identified by residents.  Planned Parenthood's  education department in Hidalgo County recruits women from  the <i>colonias </i>and trains them in various topics  related to family planning and women's health.  The Expanded  Nutrition Program, part of the Texas Agricultural Extension  Service, has been providing training and education programs  that have served the rural <i>colonias</i> since 1968.   Headed by a home economist, the program has 20  paraprofessional teachers who provide training to residents  of the <i>colonias</i> and other rural areas.  The programs  are six to eight months long and include training in basic  skills, food preparation, menu planning, budgeting, and  self-esteem.   Additional projects using this model are  being initiated by the Hidalgo County Health Care  Corporation (HCHC), a migrant and community health center,  and the Texas Department of Human Services' Partnership for  Self Sufficiency.</p>
<h4>"One-Stop Shopping"</h4>
<p>One difficulty associated with service delivery to  migrant families is the large number of agencies involved in  the provision of services and the limited time and  transportation available to migrant farmworkers to avail  themselves of these services.  The "one-stop-shopping"  model has often been touted as one way to address these time  and transportation issues.  A successful version of this  model was observed in the Brockport, New York site where the  Oak Orchard Community Health Center uses its mobile van to  provide a variety of services to families eligible for  Migrant Head Start services during the summer season.   Before the season begins, the health center works out a  schedule of visits with the Migrant Head Start provider in  the area.  The van, staffed by a nurse practitioner, a  nurse, and a community health worker/translator who is  authorized to complete WIC certifications, comes to the Head  Start center and provides physicals, health screenings, and  immunizations for the children, and Medicaid enrollment and  WIC certification for the families.  The Head Start center's  health coordinator facilitates this process by preparing the  necessary forms for each child/family before the van  arrives.  </p>
<h4>Federal Policy Issues</h4>
<p>The needs of migrants cannot be adequately addressed  without consideration of inter-state issues.  Removal of  barriers to access that result from differing definitions  and eligibility requirements, and promotion of regional  efforts to better serve farmworkers are appropriately  addressed at the federal level.</p>
<p>The various <i><b>definitions</b></i> of migrant  farmworker have created barriers to services integration.   Often clients who are eligible for one service such as  Migrant Education may not be eligible for other services  such as Migrant Head Start or Migrant Health.  The  definition of migrant farmworker for most federally funded  programs excludes vast amounts of agricultural employment in  some states.  For example, in Oregon there is a lot of  seasonal fishing and nursery work available, but workers do  not qualify for migrant programs when employed by these  businesses.  Immigration laws have resulted in a large  number of undocumented workers who do not qualify for  services.  This stresses the available resources of the  community and makes it hard to provide needed services to  everyone.</p>
<p>Program <b><i>eligibility requirements</i></b> and  definitions should be reviewed to identify specific gaps  created by the lack of uniformity.  The problem of the  formerly Migrant Head Start child who is no longer eligible  for Migrant Head Start but who is too young for regional  Head Start, is an example.  These gaps and others should be  addressed primarily by mechanisms that increase flexibility.   Federal officials should convey their commitment to service  integration to state and local administrators, and provide a  clear mandate for flexibility in order to promote service  integration.  This flexibility should include granting  waivers and giving states more autonomy in defining "migrant"  and "seasonal farmworker," so that they can better  meet the needs of the workers in their communities through  existing programs.</p>
<p><b><i>Regionalized efforts</i></b>, most notably those  undertaken by the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, the  Texas Migrant Council, and Texas Migrant Interstate Program,  are an effective means of providing continuity for migrant  children.  Despite the success of these examples, efforts to  promote applications of this model are limited.</p>
<p>The federal government should encourage such efforts  throughout the country for all programs serving migrants.   The federal government might also provide incentives for  growers and other businesses and providers in the community  to participate in such regional networks.  For example, some  of the factors that make the partnership between growers and  service providers work so well in Belle Glade, Florida could  be expanded to other communities with federal encouragement.   Policymakers should provide incentives for cooperation  among growers to assist in service integration for migrant  families.  Joint efforts might enable small growers to  overcome the economic barriers posed by dependence on a few  crops or a short growing season, so that they can begin to  offer some of the support that the larger growers, such as  those in South Florida, are able to provide.</p>
<p>A lack of quality <i><b>housing</b></i> exacerbates  health and other needs of farmworkers.  Many problems could  be eliminated in the long range if more affordable housing  and better environmental health services were made  available.  An opportunity for more service integration at  the federal level clearly exists.  The Department of Housing  and Urban Development, the Department of Labor, and the  Environmental Protection Agency need to be brought into the  mainstream of some of the federal service integration  initiatives that impact directly on migrant families.  While  each of these agencies has some involvement now, it tends to  be for specific services, which are provided independent of  other agencies.  </p>
<p><b> <i>Factors to be Considered at Federal, State, and  Local Levels</i>  </b></p>
<p>Some lessons learned in this study should be considered  at all levels in planning services and programs for migrant  families.</p>
<ul><li> Any national or state policies or evaluations must  consider issues of scale.  The numbers to be served, the  extent of the need, and the difficulties in coordinating a  great number of programs dispersed over a wide area  distinguish communities such as Hidalgo County, Texas from  smaller communities that serve migrants, particularly those  in northern, upstream locations where migrants travel for  seasonal work.  </li>
<li> Serving the family unit and meeting basic needs of the  family are essential components of programs serving migrant  children.  Parent education, housing, job training, and  other "adult" services are as important to the  child's success as health screening and education.  A  holistic approach to serving the family results in better  services to all family members, including children.  </li>
<li> An increasing number of migrant parents have  themselves been served by Migrant Head Start and Migrant  Education.  This is a new phenomenon that policymakers may  wish to consider.  Parents are aware of programs available  to their children and know of the value of these programs.   They do not attach a stigma to seeking help from these  programs, as earlier generations may have.  Current and  future migrant parents can be expected to be more  sophisticated, demanding, and involved consumers.  </li>
<li> Immigration laws and economic conditions, among other  factors, impact on the demographics of the migrant  population.  These changes affect the skills needed by  service providers, the types of services required, and the  procedures needed for interstate coordination.  For example,  it was noted that one impact of the Immigration and Reform  Act of 1986 was an increase in Hispanic families in the  migrant labor stream.  Many communities are seeing greater  numbers of families from rural Mexico and Central America  who speak dialects unfamiliar even to bilingual staff.  </li>
