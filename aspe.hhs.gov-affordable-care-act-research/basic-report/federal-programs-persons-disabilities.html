<p>This report was prepared under Contract No. HHS-88-0047 to the  		Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation. The overall purpose of the project, <b>Disability  		Profiles and Policy Analyses</b>, was to produce a series of analytical reports  		and policy analyses of the working-age disabled population using data from the  		1984 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). This  		report, <b>Federal Programs for Persons with Disabilities</b>, constitutes one  		report of the series, and is intended to serve as a compendium of the major  		Federal assistance programs for persons with disabilities. </p>
<p>The Federal project officer was Michele Adler of the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), Office of Social  		Services Policy, Division on Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care. This report  		was prepared by SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill under subcontract to Mathematica  		Policy Research, which was the prime contractor. The Project Director at  		Mathematica Policy Research was Pat Doyle, Ph.D. </p>
<p>The authors would like to thank Michele Adler and Lowell Ayre of ASPE,  		and Pat Doyle and Craig Thornton of Mathematica Policy Research, for their  		comments on previous drafts of this report. Administrative support at  		SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill was provided by Kipp Gabriel. The statements contained  		in the report are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect  		the views or policies of the Department of Health and Human Services. The  		authors assume sole responsibility for the accuracy of the information  		contained in the report. The authors confess to instances of outright  		plagiarism of other government publications which also describe the various  		disability programs presented in this report, particularly when it was felt  		that no improvements in presentation were possible. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Federal assistance to persons with disabilities is provided through a  		wide variety of programs throughout the Federal government. Indeed, the  		development of Federal policies concerning the provision of assistance to  		persons with disabilities is hampered by the fact that there are a bewildering  		array of Federal programs which provide financial assistance, health insurance  		coverage and direct supportive services to people who have various types of  		disabling conditions. These programs often interact, or overlap, with regard to  		eligibility rules, services provided, and benefit levels in complex, not to  		mention confusing, ways. </p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of some of the  		major Federal programs which provide assistance to persons with disabling  		conditions. The report is by no means a complete compendium of Federal  		assistance programs. There are many other Federal programs, not included here,  		which provide financial assistance or services to disabled people. The report  		focuses on the larger Federal programs, in terms of persons served and annual  		expenditure levels, with a particular focus on the four major sources of cash  		assistance and health insurance coverage: Social Security Disability Insurance  		(SSDI), the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, Medicare and Medicaid.  		</p>
<p>In the report, we focus on programs, or components of programs, which  		provide assistance to persons with disabilities who are under the age of 65.  		Many persons with disabling conditions have conditions which are strongly  		associated with the aging process, and many Federal programs are designed to  		provide assistance to persons who develop disabling conditions during their  		later stages of life. This report makes a distinction between Federal programs  		which provide assistance to persons under age 65 with disabilities, and to  		persons with disabilities over the age of 65, whenever the data are available  		to make such a distinction. For example, in our descriptions of Medicare and  		Medicaid, we have focused on the components of these programs which provide  		health insurance coverage for persons under the age of 65 only. </p>
<p>The program descriptions included in this report also focus only on  		those programs which involve the direct expenditure of resources from the  		Federal budget. We have not included descriptions of legislation and programs  		which are designed to protect the legal and civil rights of persons with  		disabilities with regard to education, housing, transportation, access, civil  		liberties and protection from victimization. The report also does not include  		descriptions of Federal tax expenditures for persons with disabilities relating  		to various provisions of the Internal Revenue code. These expenditures include  		such provisions as the exclusion of Social Security and Medicare benefits from  		Federal income tax, exclusion of workmen's compensation benefits paid to  		disabled coal miners, and special tax credits for persons with disabilities.  		</p>
<p>The report is divided into three major sections. The first section  		describes programs which provide direct financial assistance to persons who are  		not able to support themselves through work as a result of a disabling  		condition. The second section describes programs which provide health insurance  		and direct medical care to persons who are disabled, and because they are not  		in the work force, do not have access to employer-sponsored health care  		benefits. The third section describes some of the major Federal programs which  		finance direct supportive services to persons with disabilities. </p>
<p>We have tried to make all of the program descriptions comparable in  		format and structure, although this was sometimes difficult due to the  		fundamental differences between disability insurance programs and direct  		services programs, entitlement versus discretionary programs, and so on. One  		key feature we have tried to focus on is how each program defines the concept  		of "disability" and what eligibility rules and administrative procedures are  		established in each program to determine whether an applicant for benefits  		meets that program's operational definition of "disabled." In our review of  		these programs, it has become clear to us that the concepts of "disabled" and  		"not disabled" are not ones that are easily operationalized in the development  		of equitable and judicious program policies which, on the one hand, assist  		persons with disabling conditions to live productive and independent lives, but  		which, on the other hand, do not reinforce cultural barriers which have  		historically excluded, and continue to exclude, persons with disabling  		conditions from participating in the mainstream of business, sports,  		recreation, family life, entertainment, transportation, and educational  		opportunities available to persons without disabling conditions. </p>
<p>The Federal programs described in this report provided over $85 billion  		in cash assistance, medical care, and direct services to persons with  		disabilities under the age of 65 in FY 1989, constituting about 7.7% of total  		Federal outlays for the year. It is hoped that this report will provide readers  		with some understanding of how these resources are being spent, who is being  		served, and how these various Federal programs contribute, or fail to  		contribute, to a comprehensive Federal policy towards non-elderly persons with  		disabling conditions.</p>
<h2><a name="SSDI" id="SSDI">CHAPTER 2. THE SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE (DI)  		PROGRAM</a></h2>
<h3>2.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly  		cash benefits to insured disabled workers under age 65 and their dependents.  		Like the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Program (OASI), the purpose of the DI  		program is to replace income lost when a wage-earner is no longer able to work.  		It is the primary social insurance program in the United States for protecting  		workers from the potential loss of income due to a mental or physical  		disability that results in an inability to work. In FY 1989, an estimated $23.6  		billion in cash benefits were paid to 4.1 million disabled workers and their  		dependents under the DI program. </p>
<h3>2.2 Authorization, History, and Funding</h3>
<p>The Disability Insurance (DI) was originally authorized under Title II  		of the Social Security Act in 1956. Initially, benefits were provided only to  		disabled workers age 50 and older. Benefits for dependents of disabled workers  		were added under the 1958 Social Security Amendments, and benefits were  		extended to disabled workers under age 50 under the 1960 amendments. </p>
<p>DI program benefits and administrative costs are financed primarily by a  		portion of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) payroll tax on wages  		covered by Social Security. In January 1989, the FICA tax paid by both the  		employer and employee was 7.51 percent of the first $48,000 of earnings. In  		1989, 0.53 percent of the tax was allocated to the Disability Insurance Trust  		Fund, which is the source of payment for monthly DI benefits and for  		administrative expenses. In addition, the revenue derived from the taxation of  		disability benefits is also credited to the Trust Fund. </p>
<h3>2.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>To be considered disabled, an applicant for DI benefits must demonstrate  		<i>the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any  		medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to  		result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous  		period of not less than 12 months</i>. </p>
<p>This definition is the foundation of the Social Security disability  		determination process. The actual process by which Social Security determines  		whether an applicant meets this definition is significantly more complicated. A  		more detailed description of the disability determination process is provided  		in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section2.5.1">Section 2.5.1</a>. This definition of disability is  		the same for the DI program and for disability benefits provided under the  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. </p>
<h3>2.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>Unlike the OASI program, which is administered entirely by Federal  		employees of the Social Security Administration (SSA), the DI program is  		administered both by SSA and by State Disability Determination Services (DDDs),  		which are responsible for determining which applications should be awarded  		benefits. DDSs make disability determinations based on uniform regulations  		promulgated by SSA. The costs of making disability determinations for DI  		applicants are born entirely by the Federal government, but the personnel  		making the determinations are State employees. </p>
<p>To apply for DI benefits, a disabled worker must file an application at  		one of the Social Security Administration's more than 1,300 field offices. If a  		disabled worker is incapable of filing an application in person, then an  		application may be filed by phone or by mail, or if necessary, a Social  		Security worker will come to the disabled workers home. In processing a  		claim for benefits, an SSA claims representative first determines whether the  		applicant meets the "nondisability" eligibility requirements, primarily whether  		the claimant has achieved insured status. If the claimant has insured status,  		then the application is sent to the State Disability Determination Service  		(DDS), where the claim is evaluated and the determination of disability is  		made. </p>
<p>A multi-layered administrative structure has been developed by SSA for  		dealing with appeals of denied disability claims. If a disabled worker's claim  		for DI benefits is denied by the State Disability Determination Services (DDS)  		agency, he or she may request a reconsideration of the claim within 60 days of  		denial. The reconsideration is also conducted by the State DDS agency, but by  		different personnel from those who made the initial determination. If the  		application is again denied, then the claimant is allowed a hearing before an  		administrative law judge (ALJ). If the claim is denied by the administrative  		law judge, then the claimant has 60 days to request a review by the Appeals  		Council. The Appeals Council may review, affirm, modify or reverse the decision  		of the ALJ, or it may remand it to the AW for further development. After a  		decision by the Appeals Council, a claimant may seek further review of his or  		her claim only by a filing a civil action within 60 days in a United States  		district court. </p>
<h3>2.5 Eligibility for Benefits</h3>
<p><i><b><a name="section2.5.1" id="section2.5.1">2.5.1 Eligibility for disabled workers'  		benefits</a></b></i></p>
<p>To be eligible for disabled workers' benefits, a worker must: (1) have  		achieved insured status; and (2) be determined disabled according to criteria  		established by the Social Security Administration. There is a 5-month waiting  		period between the time that a claimant is determined entitled to benefits and  		the time in which benefits begin. </p>
<p><b>(1) Insured status</b></p>
<p>As an insurance program, benefits under the DI program are only  		available to disabled persons who have previously worked, and to their  		dependents. A person builds disability protection through work in employment  		covered under Social Security. "Insured status" needed to qualify for  		disability benefits differs somewhat from that needed to qualify for retirement  		and survivors' (OASI) benefits. To achieve insured status for disability  		benefits, a person must: </p>
<ol type="A"><li>Have at least one quarter of coverage for each calendar year after  		  the year in which he or she attained the age of 21 (e.g. a person of age 53  		  must have earned at least 32 quarters of coverage); <b><i>AND</i></b> </li>
<li>Have no fewer than 20 quarters of coverage during the 40-quarter  		  period prior to the first month in which his or her disability is determined to  		  have begun; <b><i>OR</i></b> </li>
<li>If determined disabled prior to age 31, have earned coverage for at  		  least half of all quarters occurring after he or she turned age 21 and prior to  		  the quarter in which he or she were first disabled. A minimum of six (6)  		  quarters of coverage is required.</li>
</ol><p>For persons who are determined to be blind, only the first condition  		listed above (A) is required to achieve insured status; neither the second nor  		third conditions apply. </p>
<p>To be credited with a quarter of coverage, workers must earn a minimum  		amount of covered earnings. Since 1978, the crediting of quarters of coverage  		has been on an annual rather than a quarterly basis. In 1989, one quarter of  		coverage is earned for each $500 of covered earnings, up to a maximum of four  		quarters of coverage per year. The amount of annual earnings needed to earn a  		quarter of coverage is updated annually based on increases in average wages.  		</p>
<p><b>(2) Determination of disability </b></p>
<blockquote><p><i>The essential problem in disability is that it is not  		  possible to construct a set of medical and vocational standards that will  		  distinguish perfectly between those who are able to work and those who are not  		  able to work.</i></p>
<p>--1979 Advisory Council on Social Security</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statutory definition of disability used in both the Social Security  		Disability Insurance (DI) program and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  		program is intentionally stringent and has been left largely unchanged since  		the enactment of the DI program in 1956. In order to be considered disabled, an  		applicant for DI or SSI disability benefits must demonstrate <i>the inability  		to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically  		determinable physical or mental impairment which be expected to result in death  		or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less  		than 12 months</i>. This definition is the cornerstone of the SSA disability  		determination process. Only persons who are totally disabled, whose disability  		is expected to be long-term, and who are unable to work at any substantial  		level, are eligible for disability benefits. Short-term, temporary  		disabilities, no matter how severe, are not covered under the DI or SSI  		programs. </p>
<p>The administrative structure for conducting disability determinations  		involves a joint partnership between SSA and State agencies. State agencies,  		generally known as disability determination services (DDSs) are responsible for  		determining which applicants should be awarded benefits. However, DDSs make  		disability determinations based on uniform regulations prescribed by SSA.  		although DDSs are staffed by State employees, the States are fully reimbursed  		by the Federal government for all administrative costs of conducting disability  		determinations. There is no State flexibility in the conduct of disability  		determinations; in theory anyway, the disability determination process should  		be administered uniformly across all fifty States. </p>
<p>If a person wishes to file for DI or SSI disability benefits, they must  		first file an application at one of SSA's more than 1,300 field offices. For  		DI, an SSA claims representative first determines whether the applicant has  		insured status, and meets other nondisability criteria for benefits. If  		insured, initial disability determinations are then conducted in a five-step  		sequential evaluation process, as described below: </p>
<p><i>Step One: Is the claimant engaging in substantial gainful activity  		(SGA)? </i></p>
<p>The first step in the disability determination process is generally  		conducted by SSA field office staff. This involves a determination of whether  		the applicant is currently working at a level of substantial gainful activity.  		In 1988, regulations defined SGA as monthly earnings of over $300 for persons  		with disabilities and over $700 for persons who are blind.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> If a person is earning more than  		the SGA limit, this is considered to be evidence that he or she is capable of  		work, regardless of other evidence of physical or mental disability. In such  		cases, the applicant is found not to be disabled, and medical and vocational  		factors are not evaluated. </p>
<p><i>Step Two: Does the claimant have a severe impairment? </i></p>
<p>If a claimant is not working, or working at the SGA level, then the  		application is forwarded to the State DDS. At the DDS, a team consisting of a  		disability examiner and a physician is assigned to the case. The team gathers  		medical and vocational evidence concerning the applicant's disability from  		available records. If the medical evidence of record is incomplete or  		conflicting, then the disability examiner may set up a medical examination  		and/or specialized tests, at no cost to the applicant. After obtaining  		sufficient medical evidence, the DDS team then determines whether the  		applicant's impairment (or combination of impairments) is severe, and if the  		impairment is expected to result in death or is expected to last for at least  		12 months. If the applicant's impairment is found not to be severe, or if the  		impairment is not expected to result in death or to last for at least 12  		months, then the applicant is determined not to be disabled for purposes of  		receiving DI or SSI benefits. </p>
<p><i>Step Three: Is the impairment so severe as to meet or equal the  		requirements of the medical listing in the regulations? </i></p>
<p>Those applicants whose claims are not denied at the first two steps of  		the disability determination process, have their conditions compared with those  		described in the Listing of Impairments, a document promulgated in regulations  		by SSA. The Listing of Impairments includes over 300 medical  		conditions--described in terms of specific signs, symptoms, and laboratory  		findings--which are disabling on medical grounds alone. If the claimant's  		condition is determined to meet or equal in severity the medical conditions  		included in the Listing of Impairments, then the claimant is determined to be  		unable to perform substantial gainful activity, and is awarded benefits. Those  		whose conditions fall short of the severity described in the Listing of  		Impairments are evaluated further, as described in Step Four. </p>
<p><i>Step Four: Does the claimant have the functional capacity to do past  		relevant work? </i></p>
<p>For claimants whose impairments do not meet or equal the severity level  		described in the Listing of Impairments, the DDS team then determines whether  		claimants are functionally able to do their former jobs. At this step, a  		claimant's residual functional capacity (RFC) is assessed. This assessment must  		take into account the claimant's alleged symptoms, especially pain. In this  		assessment process, a program medical consultant determines whether the  		claimant is capable of performing his or her past work. If so, the applicant is  		found not disabled. </p>
<p><i>Step Five: Can the claimant do other types of work? </i></p>
<p>If the claimant is determined not able to do his or her former job, then  		a determination is made whether there are other jobs in the national economy  		that he or she could perform. At this point, the applicant's disability is  		assessed in conjunction with her or her age, education, and vocational  		experience. A determination is made whether the applicant's skills can be  		transferred to other types of work in the national economy. Persons who are  		determined unable to perform their previous jobs, or other work in the national  		economy, or determined disabled, and are awarded DI benefits. </p>
<p>Although the disability determination process has been structured to  		apply reliable, consistent, and uniform criteria in determining whether someone  		is or is not capable of working. it is widely recognized that it is extremely  		difficult to develop criteria for determining the ability to work that can be  		uniformly applied to every individual case. As stated in the 1988 Report of the  		Disability Advisory Council: </p>
<blockquote><p><i>"One reason that claims for disability benefits are so difficult to  		  adjudicate is that medical conditions are not the sole cause of work  		  incapacity. Work incapacity is not the direct result of physical or mental  		  impairments alone, but rather is attributable to a variety of additional  		  factors--psychological, economic, environmental and, perhaps most importantly,  		  motivational. Incontrovertible evidence for this can be found in the many  		  people with severe disabilities who work and never apply for benefits under the  		  DI or SSI programs." </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>2.5.2 Eligibility of dependents and other disabled  		persons</i></b></p>
<p>Certain dependents of disabled workers are eligible for auxiliary  		benefits under the DI program. Spouses are eligible for benefits if: (1) they  		are 60 years of age or older, or (2) they have one or more entitled children  		under age 16 in their care. A divorced spouse is eligible if he or she is 62  		years of age or older and was married to the disabled worker for at least 10  		years. Unmarried dependent children of disabled workers who are under age 18  		are also eligible for monthly benefits. In June 1989, there were 276,000  		dependent spouses and 972,000 dependent children of disabled workers receiving  		auxiliary benefits under the DI program. </p>
<p>In addition to disabled workers and their dependents, certain disabled  		persons who would otherwise not be eligible for OASDI benefits are made  		eligible as a result of their disability. These persons include: </p>
<p><i>Disabled widows and widowers between the ages of 50 and 59</i>.  		Generally, surviving spouses of deceased Social Security beneficiaries are not  		eligible for survivor benefits until they reach age 60. Surviving spouses who  		are determined disabled are eligible for survivor benefits beginning at age 50.  		</p>
<p><i>Adult disabled children</i>. Generally, childhood benefits cease once  		a dependent child reaches age 18. However, <b>disabled</b> children of retired,  		disabled or deceased Social Security beneficiaries, who were disabled prior to  		age 22, are eligible for OASDI benefits as long as they remain disabled, even  		though they themselves have not achieved insured status. The majority of these  		persons are persons with developmental disabilities such as mental retardation,  		autism, and cerebral palsy. Cash benefits for these persons may begin at age  		18, without a five-month waiting period, and may continue as long as the person  		remains a dependent adult. </p>
<p>It is important to note that monthly cash benefits for disabled widows  		and widowers, and for adult disabled children are paid either from the OASI  		trust fund or the DI trust fund depending upon the status of the insured  		beneficiary to whom the adult disabled child or widow(er) is related. For  		example, benefits for adult disabled children of disabled workers are paid from  		the DI trust fund while benefits for adult disabled children of OASI  		beneficiaries are paid from the OASI trust fund. </p>
<p><i><b>2.5.3 Continuing Disability Reviews</b></i></p>
<p>The Social Security Act requires that every person receiving DI benefits  		undergo a periodic review of their continuing eligibility for benefits. The  		process for conducting a continuing disability review is somewhat different  		from the process for determining initial eligibility. In determining continuing  		eligibility for benefits, a medical improvement review standard is used. The  		medical improvement review standard was adopted in the 1984 amendments to the  		Social Security Act. Under this standard, once an individual is determined  		eligible for disability benefits, substantial evidence must show that medical  		improvement related to his or her ability to work has occurred and that the  		person is able to work before disability benefits can be terminated. </p>
<p>The frequency of continuing disability reviews depends upon the type of  		case. At the initial eligibility process, some persons are determined eligible  		for disability benefits but are identified as having a disability which is  		likely to improve. These cases are generally scheduled to be reviewed within 18  		months of the initial determination. Cases which are more severe, but in which  		disability is not expected to be permanent, are scheduled for review every 3  		years. Cases in which the disability is expected to be permanent are reviewed  		every 5 to 7 years. </p>
<p>Like the initial eligibility determination process, the continuing  		review process involves an orderly sequential evaluation process to determine  		whether an individual is still disabled and incapable of work. The continuing  		review process is similar to the initial determination process, but includes  		additional steps to determine if medical improvement has occurred, and if so,  		if that improvement has reached the point where the individual is now capable  		of performing his or her former job or other jobs in the national economy. If  		the individual is assessed as capable of doing work, then the DDS team will  		determine that the beneficiary's disability has ceased, and benefits are  		discontinued. </p>
<p><i><b>2.5.4 Termination of DI benefits</b></i></p>
<p>Cash benefits to disabled workers are generally terminated for one of  		two reasons: (1) the worker is determined by a continuing disability review to  		be no longer disabled; or (2) the worker reaches age 65. </p>
<p>A continuing disability review may find that a DI beneficiary is no  		longer disabled if either there has been a medical improvement in his or her  		condition that permits the beneficiary to participate in substantial gainful  		activity, <b>or</b> the beneficiary is participating in substantial gainful  		activity, regardless of his or her continuing medical condition. However, as an  		incentive to DI beneficiaries to attempt work without fear of losing benefits,  		the program provides for a nine- month "trial work period." Under this  		provision, most DI beneficiaries may work and earn any amount of income for up  		to 9 months without losing their DI cash benefits. A month of trial work is  		defined as any month in which earnings are more than $75; earnings of less than  		$75 per month are not counted as a trial work period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup> After an individual completes the 9-month  		trial work period, work performed during the trial work period can be  		considered in determining the beneficiary's ability to engage in substantial  		gainful activity (SGA) if the individual has worked for one or more month at  		the SGA level. </p>
<p>The trial work period only applies to beneficiaries who work while still  		disabled, not to beneficiaries who have medically recovered from their  		disabilities. Thus, DI benefits can be terminated at any time that a  		determination is made that a medical improvement in the beneficiary's condition  		permits him or her to participate in work, regardless of whether the  		beneficiary is in a trial work period or not. </p>
<p>Once a disabled worker reaches the age of 65, a disabled worker is  		automatically transferred to the OASI program, and he or she starts receiving  		retirement benefits. At transition to the OASI program, monthly benefits  		generally remain the same. </p>
<p>DI benefits can be withheld at any time from disabled workers who refuse  		to participate, without good cause, in a vocational rehabilitation program to  		which he or she has been referred. </p>
<h3>2.6 Benefit Levels</h3>
<p>Monthly benefits paid to disabled workers are related to the past  		earnings of the insured worker. Disability benefits are computed in much the  		same manner as benefits paid to retired workers, and are based on the insured  		worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). The PIA is based on an individual's  		taxable earnings averaged over his or her working lifetime. In June 1989, the  		average monthly benefit paid to disabled workers was $530. </p>
<p>Benefits to dependents and survivors of disabled workers are paid on the  		same basis as benefits paid to families of retired workers. Dependents of  		disabled workers receive benefits equal to 50% of the disabled worker's PIA.  		Disabled widows or widowers receive benefits equal to 71.5% of the insured  		worker's PIA. In June 1989, the average monthly benefit paid to dependent  		spouses was $137; the average benefit paid to dependent children was $151. </p>
<p>There is a limit on the total amount of monthly benefits that may be  		paid to a disabled worker and his or her dependents. The purpose of this  		provision is to ensure that no family is considerably better off financially  		after a worker becomes disabled than it was while he or she was working. The  		limitation of family benefits for disabled-worker families is somewhat more  		stringent than for retired-worker families. </p>
<h3><a name="section2.7" id="section2.7">2.7 Cost of Living Adjustments  		(COLAs)</a></h3>
<p>Under current law, DI benefits, like all Social Security and Federal SSI  		benefits, are automatically increased annually to adjust for increases in the  		cost of living. Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) are based on increases in  		the cost of living as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer  		Price Index (CPI). A COLA is provided in any year in which there is a  		measurable (0.1 percent) increase in consumer prices. If there is a year of  		price deflation and no COLA is provided, then a 2-year change in the CPI of at  		least 0.1 percent is needed before a COLA is provided. </p>
<p>The annual COLA is reflected in DI checks mailed in January of each  		year. The COLA is based on the CPI increase from the third quarter of the base  		year through the third quarter of the year in which the benefit increase  		becomes effective. Thus, the COLA provided in January 1989 DI checks reflected  		changes in the CPI between the third quarter of 1987 and the third quarter of  		1988. In addition, the COLA is based on the CPI in which the housing component  		is measured on a rental equivalence basis. </p>
<p>If the assets of the combined OASI and DI trust funds fall below a  		certain reserve ratio (20 percent) and wages increase at a rate lower than  		inflation, the automatic benefit increase will be based on wage growth rather  		than inflation. </p>
<h3>2.8 Recent Program History and Legislative Changes</h3>
<p>The most important legislative changes to the DI program in recent years  		occurred under the Social Security Disability Benefits Reforms Act of 1984  		(Public Law 98-460). This Act was enacted largely out of Congressional concerns  		over the implementation of continuing disability reviews in the early 1980s  		which led to the termination of benefits for thousands of DI beneficiaries, and  		the perceived need to assure more accurate, consistent, and uniform disability  		decisions in the DI program. Among the provisions of the Act were: </p>
<p><i>Medical improvement standard </i></p>
<p>The Act established a <i>medical improvement standard</i> which  		specified the conditions under which disability benefits can be terminated and  		the evidence required in making a determination that a beneficiary is no longer  		disabled. </p>
<p><i>Evaluation of pain </i></p>
<p>The Act required the Secretary of HHS to conduct a study concerning the  		evaluation of subjective pain in disability determinations. This study was  		completed in 1986 and basically supported the existing treatment of subjective  		pain in the DDS process. </p>
<p><i>Moratorium on mental impairment reviews </i></p>
<p>A moratorium was placed on all continuing disability reviews of cases  		involving mental impairment until the Listing of Impairments was revised and  		updated to reflect current professional knowledge on the diagnosis, treatment,  		and evaluation of mental impairments. The revised criteria were published in  		1985. </p>
<p><i>Continuation of benefits during appeals </i></p>
<p>The Act mandated the continuation of DI benefits for beneficiaries whose  		benefits are terminated in accordance with a finding by the continuing  		disability review process that the beneficiary is no longer disabled, <b>if</b>  		the beneficiary elects to appeal the decision, and at the election of the  		beneficiary. If the administrative law judge (ALJ) affirms the decision of the  		continuing disability review, then the benefits paid during the appeal process  		must be repaid. </p>
<p>The Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 also made various other  		changes to the manner in which disability determinations are initially made and  		continuously reviewed, and also included provisions requiring greater public  		dissemination of SSA procedures for conducting disability determinations. </p>
<p>More recently, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law  		100-203) lengthened the extended period of eligibility (from 15 months to 36  		months) during which a disabled beneficiary can return to work and not lose  		their entitlement to benefits. If the disabled beneficiary stops work during  		this period, then DI benefits are immediately reinstated without the  		beneficiary having to file a new application (at least until the next  		continuing disability review decision is made). </p>

<p>When a disabled worker is receiving disability benefits from more than  		one Federal, State or local government program, including worker's  		compensation, DI benefits to the worker and his family are reduced by the  		amount, if any, that the combined benefits from all sources exceed 80 percent  		of his average current earnings before he became disabled. Needs-tested  		benefits program (such as SSI), Veteran's Administration disability benefits,  		and benefits based on public employment covered by Social Security are not  		subject to this provision. Neither does the offset provision apply if a State  		worker's compensation law provides for an offset against Social Security  		disability benefits, provided that the State law was enacted prior to 1981.  		</p>
<p>There is no offset of DI benefits for workers who also receive private  		disability insurance payments. Conversely, however, most private disability  		insurance programs are structured to adjust benefits in accordance with the  		level of benefits received from DI and other public programs. </p>
<p><i><b>2.9.2 Eligibility for Medicare</b></i></p>
<p>Disabled workers receiving DI benefits are eligible for coverage under  		the Hospital Insurance (HI) component of Medicare, also referred to as Medicare  		Part A. However, there is a 24-month waiting period between the month in which  		the disabled worker becomes entitled to DI benefits and the month in which the  		worker becomes eligible for Medicare. Since there is a 5-month waiting period  		for DI benefits, an individual may have to wait 29 months from the onset of  		their disability until Medicare coverage begins. Once a disabled beneficiary  		becomes eligible for the HI (Part A) component of Medicare, he or she is also  		eligible for the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program, or Part B,  		which covers physician and ancillary services. As with other Medicare  		beneficiaries, participation in Medicare Part B is voluntary, and requires the  		payment of a Part B premium, which in 1989 is set at $31.90 per month. </p>
<p>If a disabled worker loses entitlement to DI benefits because his or her  		impairment ceases, Medicare eligibility is generally terminated at the end of  		the month following the month in which DI benefits are terminated. There are  		provisions in the law which extend Medicare benefits to disabled workers who  		attempt to return to work under a "trial work" program or whose DI benefits  		cease due to earnings which exceed the SGA level. For these beneficiaries,  		Medicare coverage is extended for not less than 39 months after the end of the  		trial work period, and possibly longer. It is often argued that the threatened  		loss of health insurance coverage is more of a work disincentive for disabled  		workers than the threatened loss of cash benefits, since health care expenses  		are more unpredictable. For those beneficiaries who have completed the two-year  		waiting period and who come back onto the DI rolls after a period of work,  		there is no additional two-year waiting period for Medicare coverage. </p>
<p>Disabled widows and widowers and adult disabled children who receive  		either DI or OASI benefits are also eligible for Medicare coverage after the  		mandatory two-year waiting period. </p>
<p>Persons who receive DI benefits as dependents or survivors of disabled  		workers (who are not themselves disabled) are <b>not</b> eligible for Medicare  		coverage. Thus, a disabled worker who can no longer work may receive health  		insurance coverage from Medicare after a two-year waiting period, but may have  		no health insurance coverage for his or her dependent family members. </p>
<h3>2.10 Special Program Issues</h3>
<p><i><b>2.10.1 Variation in allowance rates across States</b></i></p>
<p>State DDSs are required to apply uniform regulatory criteria in making  		disability determinations. However, data show wide variation in allowance rates  		for new DI claims across the 50 States and the District of Columbia. In FY  		1986, the national average allowance rate was 39 percent for initial  		determinations, but this rate varied from 28.3 percent to 52.6 percent across  		States. While these variations in allowance rates suggest that States are not  		making disability determinations in a uniform manner, it is also known that  		differences in allowance rates are also related, in some part, to differences  		in filing rates. For example, the number of applications for DI benefits is  		related to local economic and workforce conditions. Areas of high unemployment,  		with high numbers of poorly educated and low-skilled workers, have more  		applications for DI benefits per thousand population than areas where economic  		conditions are better. Workers with marginal impairments obviously have more  		opportunities to find other kinds of work in areas where workers are in high  		demand than in areas where there is greater competition for jobs. In addition,  		some States require applicants for welfare benefits (e.g. AFDC benefits) to  		first apply for DI or SSI disability benefits. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, developing a disability determination system that exhibits  		nationwide uniformity in the application of disability criteria is an ongoing  		objective of the Social Security Administration. A number of initiatives have  		been implemented in recent years to increase uniformity in the review process.  		Many other initiatives have been recommended, but because the disability  		determination process always retains a subjective component, it is difficult to  		achieve national uniformity. One recommendation for achieving increased  		uniformity has been Federalize the review process entirely, so that Federal,  		rather than State, agencies conduct disability reviews. However, there are  		legitimate arguments for maintaining a decentralized system, including the  		desire to link the disability determination process with State vocational  		rehabilitation programs. </p>
<p><b><i>2.10.2 Disability determinations appeals process</i></b></p>
<p>As previously discussed, SSA has established a multi-layered system for  		handling appeals of denied disability claims and terminations of DI benefits.  		There is still some controversy concerning the equity and uniformity of this  		system. Although all levels of the disability determination system are required  		to apply the same criteria and standards in making determinations, it does not  		appear that all levels of the system apply the same criteria uniformly. For  		example, of denied initial applications which were appealed to the  		administrative law judge level in 1987, 57% of denials were reversed by ALJ  		dispositions.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> Of  		terminated continuing disability reviews, 51% of appealed decisions were  		reversed. </p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit2-1">Exhibit 2-1</a> shows the number of cases allowed  		at appeal at various levels of appeal for both initial applications and  		continuing disability reviews in 1988. For initial applications, 36% were  		initially allowed, while 64% were denied. However, after all levels of appeal  		had been exhausted, some 49% of initial applications were eventually allowed.  		For continuing disability reviews, 88% of current cases were continued, and 12%  		terminated. Subsequent appeals of terminated cases eventually led to a reversal  		of 21% of cases initially terminated. In all, after all levels of appeal are  		considered, about 9% of DI beneficiaries undergoing a continuing disability  		review are eventually terminated. In 1988, DDSs conducted 290,942 continuing  		disability reviews, about 8.3 percent of the active disability caseload. </p>
<p><b><i>2.10.3 Vocational rehabilitation of disabled workers</i></b></p>
<p>The Social Security Administration also administers a program which  		reimburses States for 100% of the cost for reasonable and necessary vocational  		services for DI beneficiaries if the services result in savings and is  		successful. A successful rehabilitation is defined by law as the completion o a  		continuous 9-month period of employment at the SGA level. </p>

</tr></table><p>The present VR reimbursement program was enacted as part of the Omnibus  		Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. This legislation changed SSA's VR program  		from a grant program to one in which States VR agencies are reimbursed only for  		successful rehabilitations. Under the old grant program, known as the  		Beneficiary Rehabilitation Program, SSA provided State VR agencies with a lump  		sum advance. Several studies questioned the cost effectiveness of this program,  		and in 1981 it was replaced with the current program. In 1988, SSA reimbursed  		State VR agencies $16 million from the Disability Trust Fund for the costs of  		successfully rehabilitation DI beneficiaries. </p>
<p>Under guidelines developed by SSA, State DDS workers refer persons  		awarded disability benefits to State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Agencies.  		Under these guidelines, only those beneficiaries who are considered good  		candidates for rehabilitation, and who could potentially benefit from State VR  		services, are referred. If referred, a DI beneficiary may lose his or her  		benefits for refusing rehabilitation services without good cause. </p>
<p>A recent GAO study of the rehabilitation of DI beneficiaries found that  		State VR programs have very little effect on rehabilitating disabled workers in  		the DI program.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup> In a  		ten-State study, GAO found that about 12 percent of DI beneficiaries were  		evaluated by State VR agencies. Only 1 percent of the beneficiaries had been  		removed from the DI rolls after three years as a result of working, and only  		about one-third of these had been served by a State VR agency. Thus, only about  		3 DI beneficiaries in 1,000 had returned to work and been removed from the DI  		rolls as a result of State VR efforts. In the study, State VR counselors  		indicated that many DI beneficiaries do not participate in rehabilitation  		programs because of their fear of losing cash benefits and Medicare coverage.  		Many felt that more disabled workers would try to work if they could continue  		to keep their Medicare coverage and if their cash benefits were continued on a  		sliding scale basis. </p>
<p><b><i>2.10.4 Work incentives in the DI program</i></b></p>
<p>Less than 1 percent of disabled workers leave the DI rolls because they  		return to work. In recognition of the fact that beneficiaries will be more  		likely to return to work if their cash benefits and health insurance coverage  		are not jeopardized by their work efforts, a number of work incentive  		provisions have been built into the DI program. These provisions, as previously  		discussed, include: </p>
<ul><li>Entitlement to DI benefits is never terminated during the trial work  		  period due to earnings as long as the person remains disabled (does not  		  medically recover), regardless of the amount of earnings; </li>
<li>The extended period of eligibility (EPE) permits the prompt  		  reinstatement of DI benefits to persons who stop performing SGA within the 36  		  consecutive-month period immediately following the trial work period, provided  		  they remain disabled. During the extended period of eligibility, a new  		  application or a new disability determination is not required before DI  		  benefits are reinstated; </li>
<li>There is no 5-month waiting period for DI benefits for a worker who  		  becomes reentitled to benefits within 5 years of a prior period of disability.  		  </li>
<li>For disabled workers who return to work, certain impairment-related  		  work expenses can be deducted in determining whether the worker is engaging in  		  substantial gainful activity; </li>
<li>For persons who medically recover while participating in a State VR  		  program, cash benefits are continued until their rehabilitation program is  		  completed; and </li>
<li>Medicare benefits are extended for beneficiaries who return to work,  		  plus Medicare coverage is automatically reinstated for beneficiaries who return  		  to the DI rolls after a period of work, without a 24-month waiting period.  		  </li>
</ul><p>Despite these work incentives, many believe that the program does not go  		far enough in encouraging DI beneficiaries to return to work. For example, the  		Disability Advisory Council noted that the SGA level has not increased since  		1980, and recommended that it be adjusted annually to reflect average wage  		growth. The Council also recommended that the monthly earnings amount that  		counts toward the trial work period be raised from the current level of $75.  		The Council also noted that adequate evaluations of the various work incentives  		in the DI program, and of possible alternative incentives, have not been  		conducted. </p>

</tr></table><p>The application rate for DI benefits (number of applications per 1,000  		insured workers) has been gradually declining, while the percentage of  		applications awarded has been increasing gradually. This may reflect an  		increased awareness among potential applicants of the likelihood of receiving  		an award. In 1988, 1,017,900 application were filed and 409,490 new awards  		approved, for an overall approval rate of 40 percent. The number of awards per  		1,000 insured workers declined from 4.0 in 1980 to 3.0 in 1983, but then  		increased to 3.6 in 1988. </p>

With regard to financial status, DI beneficiaries who were  		married were significantly better off than unmarried beneficiaries. Overall, 66  		percent of new DI beneficiaries were married, but this percentage differed  		greatly by sex. Among male beneficiaries, 74 percent were married, compared to  		only 49 percent of female beneficiaries. Median monthly household income for  		married men in 1982 was $1,230 and for married women, $1,360. This contrasted  		sharply with the average median household income for unmarried men, which was  		$490, and for unmarried women, which was $460. </p>
<p>The primary reason that families of married DI beneficiaries are better  		off financially than unmarried beneficiaries is the presence of earnings from  		the disabled worker's spouse. Social Security benefits (of all types, not just  		disabled workers benefits) accounted for 43 percent of total income for married  		disabled workers, but for 65 percent of total income for unmarried  		beneficiaries. </p>

Most of these persons receive their cash benefits from the OASI trust  		fund, not the DI trust fund, since they are eligible as children or spouses of  		retired or deceased beneficiaries. Over half of all adult disabled children,  		about 299,000, also received SSI benefits in 1987. </p>
<p>Adult disabled children are one of the fastest growing benefit  		populations in the Social Security program.

Total cash benefits paid to adult disabled  		children in 1987 were just under $2.0 billion. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the number of disabled widows and widowers receiving  		OASDI benefits declined from 127,580 in 1980 to 104,991 in 1987. Total cash  		payments to disabled widows and widowers in 1987 were approximately $415  		million.</p>

<h2><a name="SSI" id="SSI">CHAPTER 3. THE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME (SSI)  		PROGRAM</a></h2>
<h3>3.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash  		benefits to aged, blind and disabled persons who meet financial criteria. In  		contrast to the Social Security program (OASDI), SSI applicants do not have to  		achieve insured status to be eligible for benefits (i.e., they do not have to  		have worked) but they do have to be poor. The purpose of the program is to  		provide needy aged, blind and disabled persons with financial assistance for  		basic living needs. At their option, States may supplement Federal SSI benefits  		through State Supplementation Programs (SSP). In FY 1989, approximately 4.5  		million persons, including over 3.1 million blind and disabled persons,  		received cash assistance under the SSI/SSP program.</p>
<h3>3.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>The SSI program was authorized under Title XVI of the Social Security  		Act in the 1972 amendments (Public Law 92-603) to the Act, and was first  		implemented in 1974. The SSI program replaced a previous program of Federal  		grants to States for old-age assistance, aid to the blind, and aid to the  		permanently and totally disabled. Enactment of the SSI program served to  		establish uniform, nationwide eligibility requirements for Federal SSI benefits  		across all States, while leaving States the flexibility to supplement Federal  		benefits at their discretion. Enactment of SSI also extended Federal cash  		assistance to disabled children under the age of 18 for the first time.  		Although the SSI program has undergone numerous refinements and modifications  		since its enactment, the basic structure of the program has not changed since  		1974.</p>
<p>Unlike the OASDI program, SSI is not financed through a self-contained  		financing structure or trust fund. Payments to SSI recipients are drawn from  		Federal tax revenues. Estimated Federal outlays under the SSI program were  		about $11.8 billion in FY 1989, of which 77 percent, or $9.1 billion, went to  		disabled SSI recipients.</p>
<h3>3.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>The definition of disability employed in determining the eligibility of  		persons under the age of 65 for SSI benefits is exactly the same definition  		(and process) used in determining the eligibility of disabled workers for DI  		benefits: <i>the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by  		reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be  		expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a  		continuous period of not less than 12 months. </i>A more detailed explanation  		of this definition, including how the definition is operationalized in  		determining the eligibility of program applicants, was provided in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSDI">Chapter 2</a> of this report.</p>
<p>However, the SSI program covers a beneficiary population that is  		generally not covered in the SSDI program: disabled children. The definition of  		disability initially developed for the SSDI program, and then adopted for the  		SSI program, focuses on determining whether an applicant is incapable of work.  		Consequently, the disability determination process has had to be modified in  		determining the eligibility of SSI children. The process attempts to assess  		whether child applicants have impairments which are of comparable severity to  		that of adults who are determined disabled. Generally, this is done by  		assessing the impact of a child's impairment on expected age-related activities  		such as participation in school, in play and in other normal daily activities.  		Like the process for determining disability among adults, the process for  		determining the eligibility of disabled children is an imprecise one, and  		remains controversial.</p>
<h3>3.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>The administration of SSI benefits for disabled persons is conducted in  		much the same manner as the administration of SSDI benefits. Social Security  		Administration staff determine whether program applicants meet the financial  		criteria for SSI benefits, while State Disability Determination Services (DDSs)  		determine whether applicants meet the disability criteria. For those applicants  		who are denied benefits on the basis of not meeting the disability  		requirements, a multi-layered administrative structure has been established to  		handle appeals. This structure, as well as the prevalence and outcomes of  		appealed claims, is also discussed in some detail in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSDI">Chapter  		2</a>.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the SSI program, however, is the State  		supplementation of Federal benefits. Most States elect to raise the benefit  		levels provided by the Federal SSI program with additional benefits provided  		through State general revenues. Since benefits provided through State  		supplementation programs are financed with 100% State funds, States have wide  		discretion over who is eligible to receive supplemental benefits, and how much.  		All but seven States currently provide some supplemental benefits to the  		Federal SSI program.</p>
<p>In addition to deciding whether to supplement Federal SSI benefits,  		States can choose to administer State supplementation payments directly, or to  		contract with the Social Security Administration to administer their  		supplementation payments. Under Federal administration, the State is  		responsible for program benefit costs only; the Federal government assumes  		responsibility for administrative costs. Despite this fact, of the 43 States  		which supplement Federal SSI benefits, only 17 and the District of Columbia  		have opted for Federal administration of State supplementation payments. In  		States where State supplementation payments are Federally-administered, the  		amount of the supplementary payment is added to the monthly SSI payment and the  		total benefit is paid in one check. When a State elects to administer State  		supplementation payments directly, the applicant must make a separate  		application at a State welfare office, and, if eligible, receives two separate  		checks monthly.</p>
<h3>3.5 Eligibility-for Benefits</h3>
<p>To qualify for SSI payments, disabled persons under age 65 must: (1) be  		determined disabled according to criteria established by the Social Security  		Administration; and (2) be determined financially needy in regard to both  		income and assets. The disability determination process was discussed in some  		detail in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSDI">Chapter 2</a> and will not be discussed further in  		this chapter.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> Unlike  		the SSDI, the determination of financial need is unique to the SSI program,  		however, and involves the application of both income criteria and asset  		criteria.</p>
<p><i><b>3.5.1 Federal SSI benefit standards</b></i></p>
<p>In 1989, the Federal SSI benefit standard for an individual was $368 per  		month and $553 for a couple. In determining eligibility for SSI benefits, an  		individual's or couple's "countable" income is compared to these benefit  		standards. If an individual's or couple's countable income exceeds the Federal  		SSI benefit standard, then they are not eligible for SSI benefits. If countable  		income falls below the benefit standard, then the SSI payment amount is set  		equal to the difference between the Federal benefit standard and countable  		income (assuming the applicant also meets the asset criteria). For example, if  		a disabled individual's countable income in 1989 is $300, then the SSI payment  		amount would be $68 (the Federal benefit standard of $368 minus countable  		income of $300). SSI benefit standards are adjusted each year to reflect  		increases in the cost of living. The increase is computed in the same manner in  		which cost of living adjustments (COLAs) are computed for all Social Security  		beneficiaries (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section2.7">Section 2.7</a>).</p>
<p><i><b>3.5.2 Income disregards</b></i></p>
<p>In computing countable income for SSI benefits, certain income is  		"disregarded." Thus, certain applicants with gross incomes above the Federal  		benefit standard may end up having countable incomes below the standard, and  		thereby qualify for benefits. Income disregards include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The first $20 of monthly income from any source, earned or  			 unearned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the first $65 of monthly earned income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, one-half of all remaining earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impairment-related work expenses for the disabled. For example, if a  			 disabled person must use public transportation to get to work because he or she  			 cannot drive, then those expenses would be deducted from his or her gross  			 income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For disabled and blind individuals, the cost of an approved plan for  			 achieving self-support (PASS) is also disregarded. The plan may involve setting  			 aside income (or resources) to achieve a work goal such as education,  			 vocational training or starting a business. The individual must have a feasible  			 work goal, a specific savings plan, and must provide for a clearly identifiable  			 accounting for the funds which are set aside. Any person may help a disabled  			 SSI applicant with developing a PASS and any SSI beneficiary can have a PASS. A  			 PASS is often needed when a disabled SSI recipient begins to work, and earnings  			 begin to rise, in order to remain eligible for SSI benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, any financial assistance paid by State or local  			 governments based on financial need is disregarded. For example, the value of  			 Food Stamps, housing subsidies, or low-income energy assistance is not included  			 as countable income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any in-kind support and maintenance provided by a private nonprofit  			 organization is disregarded, as long as the State determines that the  			 assistance is provided on the basis of need. For example, the value of in-kind  			 support provided to persons with mental retardation residing in group homes  			 operated by non-profit agencies is not included as countable income.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>3.5.3 Reduced benefit standard for in-kind support and  		maintenance</b></i></p>
<p>When an SSI applicant or recipient is receiving in-kind support and  		maintenance from another person, then the Federal SSI benefit standard is  		reduced by one-third. Since the purpose of the SSI program is to provide  		financial assistance with basic living needs (food, clothing, shelter), this  		assistance is reduced when other sources of assistance are available. For  		example, if a 33-year-old woman with chronic mental illness is living in her  		sister's household, and does not contribute to room and board costs, then the  		maximum SSI payment she may receive is two-thirds the standard benefit level.  		In 1989, instead of receiving $368 per month from SSI (assuming she has no  		other income), she would receive $245.34.</p>
<p>Similarly, when an SSI recipient receives in-kind support from other  		persons, even though they may not live in the same household, then the  		recipient may also be subject to the one-third reduction rule. For example, if  		a disabled man lives in his own apartment, but his son pays his rent, then his  		SSI benefit standard is reduced by one-third. In no case can the SSI benefit be  		reduced by more than one-third, plus $20. The benefit may be reduced by less  		than one-third if the SSI applicant/recipient can prove that the actual value  		of in-kind support received is <b>less</b> one-third the Federal benefit  		standard. Benefits are not reduced for other types of in-kind support, such as  		gifts, transportation, medical expenses, etc. Of the approximately 3 million  		disabled SSI beneficiaries receiving payments in January 1989, about 5.8%  		received reduced benefits under this "one-third reduction rule" because they  		lived in another person's household or received in-kind support from other  		persons.</p>
<p><i><b>3.5.4 Resource Standards</b></i></p>
<p>In addition to income criteria, financial need under SSI is also  		determined by resource criteria. In 1989, SSI recipients were required to hold  		countable assets of less than $2,000, or in the case of a couple, less than  		$3,000. Persons with countable assets in excess of these limits are not  		eligible for SSI benefits, regardless of income. Neither is there any provision  		for reducing benefit levels by the amount by which applicants exceed the  		resource standards. If an individual has $2,001 in countable assets, he or she  		simply is not eligible.</p>
<p>As with income, certain resources are not counted when determining  		whether an applicant qualifies for SSI. These exemptions include:</p>
<ul><li>A personal residence of any value;</li>
<li>up to $2,000 equity value in household goods and personal  		  effects;</li>
<li>the first $4,500 of the current market wholesale value of a car, but  		  100% of the market value of any car used for medical treatment or employment or  		  which has been modified for use by a handicapped person;</li>
<li>Any assets or property essential to the self-support of disabled  		  persons; and</li>
<li>Cash value of life insurance policies with face values of $1,500 or  		  less, <b>or</b> up to $1,500 in separately identifiable funds for burial  		  expenses;</li>
</ul><p><i><b>3.5.5 Deeming of Income and Resources</b></i></p>
<p>In the case of a disabled SSI applicant who is married, or in the case  		of a disabled child applicant, the income and resources of ineligible spouses  		and parents are taken into account in determining the eligibility of the  		applicant. This process is called "deeming." Income and resources from  		ineligible spouses and parents are deemed available to the applicant because it  		is reasonable to expect spouses and parents to help in meeting an applicant's  		basic living needs. The rules for deeming income and resources from spouse to  		spouse and parent to child can get quite complicated, and this section will  		only provide a general discussion.</p>
<p>In considering the amount of income available to an applicant from an  		ineligible spouse, all of the income exclusions which are applied to the  		applicant are also applied to the ineligible spouse. Deductions from income are  		also allowed for each dependent child living in the household. Once these  		income deductions and exclusions are applied, the remaining income of the  		ineligible spouse is combined with the income of the eligible spouse and  		applied to the Federal SSI benefit standard for a couple. <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-1">Exhibit 3-1</a> provides an example of how the deeming of  		income from spouse to spouse would work in the SSI program.</p>
<table title="EXHIBIT 3-1: Deeming of Income from Spouse to Spouse in Determining Eligibility for SSI Benefits"><tr><td><b><font><a name="exhibit3-1" id="exhibit3-1">EXHIBIT 3-1</a>: Deeming of Income from  			 Spouse to Spouse in Determining Eligibility for SSI Benefits</font></b></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Marty, a  			 disabled individual, lives with his ineligible spouse, Rebekah, and their two  			 children, Jennifer and Kristin. Marty receives $230 in SSDI benefits monthly,  			 and Rebekah has monthly earned income of $1,000. After application of the $20  			 income disregard, Martys countable income is $210 per month. In deeming  			 income from Rebekah to Marty, allocations are first made for the needs of the  			 two children. The allocation amount is one-half the Federal SSI benefit  			 standard ($184 in 1989) for each child. This leaves Rebekah with with $632 in  			 monthly earned income. From this amount, the $65 earned income disregard is  			 first deducted, and then one-half of all remaining earnings, leaving Rebekah  			 with a countable monthly income of $283.50. This amount is then combined with  			 Martys countable income of $210 for a total countable income for the  			 couple of $493.50. This amount is then subtracted from the Federal SSI benefit  			 standard for a couple ($553 in 1989) to determine the monthly SSI payment  			 amount for which they are eligible: $59.50.</font></td>
</tr></table><p>The deeming of income from parents to disabled children works somewhat  		differently, as shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-2">Exhibit 3-2</a>. Deeming rules  		from parent to child are more liberal than deeming rules from spouse to spouse.  		As shown in the example provided, a disabled child living in a family of four  		with a total annual income of over $25,000 (about twice the Federal poverty  		level) can still qualify for SSI benefits (assuming SSI resource standards can  		also be met). Although the SSI benefit level may be modest, an important  		consideration is that receipt of SSI benefits automatically qualifies disabled  		children for health insurance coverage under Medicaid (except in a very few  		States). The benefits provided to families with disabled children under  		Medicaid may far exceed the cash assistance which they receive through SSI. Of  		the 289,000 blind and disabled children receiving SSI benefits in 1987, only  		about 8 percent receive reduced benefits due to the deeming of parental income.  		This suggests that the participation of non-poor families with disabled  		children in the SSI program is considerably less than it could be.</p>

Ervin and Joyce both work, and have a combined  			 monthly income of $2,100. In deeming the income available to Joshua from his  			 parents, an allocation is first made for Brendan of $184, half the Federal  			 benefit standard. The $20 income disregard is then applied, plus the $65 earned  			 income disregard, reducing available income from the parents to $1,831, which  			 is then reduced by half, leaving $915.50. This amount is then reduced by the  			 Federal benefit standard for a couple ($553 in 1989), leaving $362.50 deemed  			 available to Joshua.

His monthly SSI benefit payment is  			 then applied the Federal SSI benefit standard ($368 in 1989) to determine his  			 monthly benefit: $25.50. Note that while the deeming of parental income left  			 Joshua with countable income sufficient to reduce his SSI benefit level to a  			 relatively modest amount of $25.50 per month, his eligibility for SSI benefits  			 automatically renders Joshua eligible for health insurance coverage under  			 Medicaid in most States (see Chapter 10). Joshuas eligibility for  			 Medicaid may help to reduce out-of-pocket health care expenses for the Scott  			 family significantly. </font></td>
</tr></table><p><i><b>3.5.6 Residents of Public Institutions Not Eligible</b></i></p>
<p>Persons in public institutions that are not certified for Medicaid  		payments are not eligible for SSI benefits. These persons include residents of  		State mental hospitals, prisoners, and residents of publicly-operated nursing  		homes not certified for Medicaid reimbursement. Exceptions to this rule are  		persons in publicly-operated community residences serving no more than 16  		persons (e.g. group homes for the chronically mentally ill which are publicly  		operated) and SSI recipients who are receiving temporary medical or psychiatric  		care (less than 3 months) in a public institution.</p>
<p><i><b>3.5.7 Termination of SSI benefits</b></i></p>
<p>SSI benefits for the disabled are generally terminated for one of two  		reasons: (1) the recipient is found by a continuing disability review to no  		longer be disabled; or (2) the recipient's countable income or assets, upon  		financial redetermination, are found to exceed SSI/SSP standards. Financial  		redeterminations are scheduled periodically, and the length of time between  		redeterminations depends upon the likelihood that the recipient's situation may  		change in a manner that affects his or her benefit amount. Recipients are also  		required to report any changes in their financial or household status that may  		affect their eligibility or payment amount.</p>
<p>Disabled SSI beneficiaries who have been medically determined to be drug  		addicts or alcoholics may also lose their eligibility for benefits if they  		refuse to undergo available appropriate treatment or if they fail to comply  		with the requirements of such treatment.</p>
<h3>3.6 SSI Benefits</h3>
<p>Persons eligible for SSI benefits receive monthly cash payments. The  		amount of the benefit depends primarily on two factors: (1) the beneficiary's  		countable income; and (2) the amount of State supplementation for which the  		beneficiary may qualify (see below). For persons with no countable income, the  		Federal SSI payment amount is equal to the Federal benefit standard. Federal  		SSI benefit standards are indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the same  		manner as Social Security benefits. Federal SSI benefit standards since 1980  		for individuals and couples living in their own household are presented in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-3">Exhibit 3-3</a>. For individuals and couples with  		countable income greater than zero, the SSI payment amount equals the  		difference between countable income and the Federal benefit standard. For  		example, in 1989, if a disabled individual had countable income of $150 per  		month, the Federal benefit amount would equal $218 ($368 minus $150). The  		average Federal monthly benefit in January 1989 for a disabled individual,  		excluding State supplementation, was $257.83.</p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>3.6.1 Reduced benefits in Medicaid-certified  		institutions</b></i></p>
<p>As previously discussed, SSI benefits are reduced by one-third when a  		recipient is receiving in-kind support and maintenance in another person's  		household. Similarly, SSI benefits are reduced when recipients are receiving  		care in Medicaid-certified institutions such as nursing homes. Because Medicaid  		payments to the providers of such institutions include the costs of providing  		room and board, a lower SSI benefit standard is used. This lower benefit  		standard, called the Personal Needs Allowance (PNA), is $30 per month, and is  		intended to take care of small personal expenses for institutionalized persons.  		Of the approximately 2.8 million SSI disabled recipients receiving benefits in  		December 1987, 4.6 percent received reduced benefits as recipients of  		Medicaid-covered institutional care. Many persons who receive SSI benefits  		prior to entering a nursing home lose their benefits upon nursing home  		admission because their countable income exceeds this lower benefit standard o  		$30 per month.</p>
<p><i><b>3.6.2 State Supplementation of Federal SSI benefits</b></i></p>
<p>States, at their option, may provide supplementary payments to Federal  		SSI benefits and all but seven States do so. The seven States which do not  		supplement SSI are Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and  		West Virginia. With regard to eligibility criteria for State supplementation  		payments, States have broad flexibility with regard to establishing "groups" of  		persons eligible for supplementation (as long as they are aged, blind, or  		disabled). Two dimensions that are frequently used by States in establishing  		eligible groups are: (a) living arrangement; and (b) functioning level. For  		example, many States establish eligibility categories by different levels of  		residential care (i.e. various types of board-and-care homes) related to the  		amount of care and supervision provided by the residential care provider.  		Further, many States establish different payment levels related to  		individualized assessments of the recipient's functioning level and service  		needs.</p>
<p>States which elect to contract with the Social Security Administration  		to administer their supplementation programs must use Federal eligibility  		criteria in all aspects, except that they may establish additional income  		disregards. In other words, States with Federally-administered supplements must  		determine "countable income" in the same manner used in determining eligibility  		for Federal SSI benefits and they must also use Federal resource standards in  		the same way. States which administer their own supplementation programs do not  		have to follow Federal SSI rules, since the Federal government is not  		contributing to the cost of the program in any way. Eighteen States and the  		District of Columbia presently contract with SSA to administer their  		supplementation programs, while 25 States administer their own programs. Since  		1974, six States have shifted from Federal to State administration.</p>
<p>A State supplementation program effectively raises the Federal SSI  		benefit standard to some higher level. In determining eligibility for benefits  		in Federally-administered programs, SSA first determines whether an applicant  		is eligible for Federal SSI benefits, and then whether the applicant may also  		be eligible for State supplementation. In cases in which the applicants  		countable income is higher than the Federal benefit standard, but lower than  		the State supplementation standard, the applicant may be eligible for State  		supplementation payments only. In State-administered supplementation programs,  		applicants must make separate applications for Federal and State benefits.</p>
<p>State supplementation standards vary both within States (e.g., by  		eligibility category) and across States. Although States retain flexibility  		with regard to the amount of State supplementation they elect to provide to  		specific groups of recipients, under Federal law, States are required to  		pass-through all Federal increases in SSI benefits to State supplementation  		recipients. In other words, States cannot offset a Federal cost-of-living  		increase in SSI benefits with a reduction in State supplementation payments.  		States are not required, however, to index their own supplementation benefit  		levels. Average State supplementation payments made to disabled individuals in  		December 1987, by State, is presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-4">Exhibit  		3-4</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="section3.7" id="section3.7">3.7 Recent Program History and  		Legislative Changes</a></h3>
<p>The provisions of the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of  		1984 relating to the conduct of continuing disability reviews, as described in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSDI">Chapter 2</a>, apply to SSI disabled recipients as well as to  		recipients of SSDI. With regard to the SSI program, the most important  		legislative change made to the program affecting disabled persons in recent  		years has been the initial demonstration and then permanent enactment of the  		Section 1619 program. Under the section 1619 program, which was made permanent  		under the SSI Disability Amendments of 1986 (Public Law 99-643), disabled SSI  		recipients continue to receive benefits even though they are working at the  		substantial gainful activity (SGA)- level and as long as there is not a medical  		improvement in their disabling condition.</p>

</tr></table><p>Prior to section 1619, disabled SSI recipients who returned to work  		could have their SSI benefits terminated on the basis of evidence that they  		were capable of working at the SGA level of $300 per month. This provision no  		longer applies to disabled SSI recipients who return to work.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup> Under Section 1619, as the  		earnings of disabled SSI recipients increase, SSI cash benefits are gradually  		reduced under the income disregard formula until their countable earnings reach  		the SSI benefit standard, or what is known as the "breakeven point." Since SSI  		eligibility rules include provisions for earned income disregards (the first  		$65 of monthly earned income plus one-half of remaining earned income), these  		disregards are used in determining the continuing benefit levels of disabled  		recipients who return to work. In a State with no supplementation program, the  		"break even" point under the section 1619 program was $821 per month in 1989.  		People who receive special SSI benefits under this provision also retain their  		eligibility for Medicaid benefits, and can even retain Medicaid eligibility  		once their income exceeds the "break even" point under other special program  		provisions. States have the option of using a similar methodology in  		determining continuing eligibility for supplementation payments of section 1619  		participants.</p>
<p>Another recent change in the SSI program was an increase in resource  		standards. From 1974, when SSI was first implemented, and 1985, the SSI  		resource standard stayed at $1,500 per month for an individual and $2,250 per  		month for a couple. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-369), SSI  		resource standards were increased $100 per year for an individual and $150 per  		year for a couple, beginning in 1985 and continuing through 1989. Thus, by  		1989, resource standards had increased to $2,000 for an individual and $3,000  		for a couple, but there is no current provision for increasing resource  		standards any further.</p>
<h3>3.8 Program Interactions</h3>
<p><i><b>3.8.1 Eligibility for Medicaid</b></i></p>
<p>The most important program interaction for disabled persons receiving  		SSI is their eligibility for health insurance coverage under Medicaid. Most,  		but not all, disabled SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid  		immediately upon receipt of SSI benefits. Unlike the link between SSDI and  		Medicare, there is no waiting period for Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>State Medicaid programs have three options with regard to extending  		eligibility for Medicaid to SSI recipients. Under the "Section 1634" option,  		SSI recipients are automatically enrolled in Medicaid, without having to make a  		separate application. Thirty States have elected this option. Under the second  		option, SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid, but they must  		make a separate application to the State agency which administers the Medicaid  		program. Six States (Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada and Oregon)  		have elected this option.</p>
<p>Under the third and most restrictive option, referred to as the Section  		"209(b)" option, States may impose more restrictive eligibility criteria for  		Medicaid than are used in determining eligibility for SSI, as long as the  		criteria were used in the State Medicaid program prior to 1972 (when the SSI  		program was enacted). States may impose more restrictive criteria in  		determining disability, and/or more restrictive income and assets criteria. For  		example, in two States (Missouri and New Hampshire) SSI disabled children under  		age 18 are not eligible for Medicaid at all. Fourteen States (Connecticut,  		Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North  		Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, and Virginia) have elected the  		209(b) option. Analyses have shown that the latter two options definitely  		reduce Medicaid enrollment of SSI disabled recipients compared to States which  		elect the 1634 option.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Certain SSI disabled recipients are protected from losing their  		eligibility for Medicaid due to increases in income from Social Security  		benefits. This includes disabled SSI recipients who become eligible for DI  		benefits as adult disabled children, and persons who become eligible for Social  		Security widow's or widower's benefits at age 60. These provisions ensure that  		disabled SSI recipients do not lose health insurance coverage simply due to  		increases in income from Social Security benefits, particularly given the  		two-year waiting period for Medicare coverage required for DI  		beneficiaries.</p>
<p>A more detailed discussion of Medicaid coverage of persons with  		disabilities is provided in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#Medicaid">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>3.8.2 Eligibility for Food Stamps</b></i></p>
<p>Unlike SSI, eligibility for food stamps is determined on a household,  		not an individual, basis. For households which are comprised entirely of SSI  		recipients (i.e. disabled SSI individuals and couples living independently),  		eligibility for food stamps is generally automatic. In households where  		disabled SSI recipients live with other household members, the household is  		allowed to take additional deductions from income (e.g., for medical expenses)  		in determining eligibility for food stamps.</p>
<p>Because food stamp benefits are reduced by $0.30 for every $1.00  		increase in recipient income, States lose Federal food stamp benefits (which  		are entirely Federally-funded) when they raise their State supplementation  		payments (which are entirely State-funded). For this reason, two States  		(California and Wisconsin) have elected to "cash out" their food stamp program,  		and to increase their State supplementation payment for SSI recipients in lieu  		of food stamps. In these two States, disabled SSI/SSP recipients are not  		eligible for food stamps; they instead receive comparable cash benefits through  		an increase in State supplementation payments.</p>
<p><i><b>3.8.3 Eligibility for AFDC</b></i></p>
<p>A disabled SSI recipient who lives in a household which is applying for  		AFDC benefits is not counted as part of the AFDC unit in determining  		eligibility for AFDC benefits. For example, an SSI disabled child living in a  		single-parent family is not taken into account in the determination of AFDC  		benefit levels for that household. At the same time, the disabled child's  		income and assets (including SSI income) are ignored in determining the AFDC  		benefit.</p>
<h3>3.9 Special Program Issues</h3>
<p>All of the issues related to the determination of disability by State  		Disability Determination Services (DDS) agencies, as discussed in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section2.9">Section 2.9</a>, are also relevant to the SSI disabled  		population. Furthermore, the section 1619 program, discussed in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section3.7">Section 3.7</a>, is now the major work incentive in the  		SSI program for disabled beneficiaries. Other program issues are discussed  		below.</p>
<p><i><b>3.9.1 SSI Participation Rates</b></i></p>
<p>Various studies have shown that many elderly persons over age 65 do not  		apply for SSI benefits, even though they would be eligible for benefits if they  		did apply. Separate studies have indicated that only about 50% of potentially  		eligible elderly SSI recipients actually participate in the program.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note9">9</a>, <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note10">10</a></font></sup> Many of  		these "non-participants" are persons with incomes that are close to Federal or  		State supplementation benefit standards, who, although eligible, would receive  		only a small monthly SSI benefit if they applied.</p>
<p>SSI participation rates for the disabled are more difficult to estimate,  		because disabled SSI beneficiaries must meet disability criteria as well as  		financial criteria. Survey data, which are generally used to estimate SSI  		participation rates among the elderly, can provide only rough estimates of the  		number of disabled persons who would pass the relatively strict definition of  		disability applied by SSA and DDSs. Thus, it is not known whether SSI  		participation rates among the disabled are similar to that among the elderly  		population.</p>
<p>Low participation rates among one sub-group of disabled persons  		<b>is</b> known: the disabled homeless. It is well known that a relatively  		large percentage (up to 30%) of homeless persons living in emergency shelters  		are chronically mentally ill, including many former residents of public mental  		hospitals. It is also known that relatively few of these homeless persons with  		chronic mental illness receive SSI benefits. There are many reasons for low SSI  		participation among this population, a major one being the difficulty which  		chronically mentally ill persons have in negotiating the SSI bureaucratic  		process, and the unavailability of persons to help them through the process.  		Consequently, the Social Security Administration has participated in a number  		of initiatives to increase SSI participation among the homeless, including the  		development of SSA outreach stations at the shelters themselves, the award of  		"immediate payments" to persons in need of emergency assistance, and the  		development of prerelease programs between SSA and public mental hospitals, in  		which SSI eligibility is determined while the patient is being prepared for  		discharge, so that payments can be initiated as soon as the patient is released  		from the hospital.</p>
<p><i><b>3.9.2 Representative Payees</b></i></p>
<p>The policy of the Social Security Administration is that every SSI  		beneficiary has the right to manage his or her own cash benefit payments.  		However, where there is evidence that the SSI beneficiary is not capable of  		managing benefits in his or her own best interests, SSI payments can be made to  		a representative payee. In general, all payments for SSI disabled children  		under age 18 are made to representative payees (usually parents). Also, persons  		with the disabilities of alcoholism or drug addiction are required to have  		representative payees. In December 1987, there were about 277,000 SSI children  		and 792,000 SSI disabled adults (about 31% of disabled adult beneficiaries)  		with representative payees. Representative payees are required to apply SSI  		payments solely for the beneficiary's current and foreseeable needs, and must  		make periodic account to SSA on how benefits were used.</p>
<h3>3.10 Program Data</h3>
<p><b><i>3.10.1 Current disabled SSI recipients, expenditures, and benefit  		levels</i></b></p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-5">Exhibit 3-5</a> presents information on the number  		of disabled persons receiving Federal SSI benefits and/or State supplementation  		payments. In January 1989, over 2.7 million disabled persons received Federal  		SSI benefits. Of these, almost 1.4 million (50%) also received a State  		supplement to their Federal benefit. An additional 221,000 disabled persons had  		countable incomes in excess of the Federal benefit standard, and were eligible  		for a State supplement only. Thus, almost 3.0 million persons with disabilities  		received monthly SSI/SSP benefits in January of 1989. Persons eligible for SSI  		benefits on the basis of disability account for about two-thirds of the total  		SSI population.</p>
<p>Total Federal SSI payments to disabled persons in January 1989 equalled  		$706.9 million in January 1989, and State supplementation payments totalled  		$165.3 million, for a total of $872.2 million in monthly cash benefits to  		persons with disabilities. It is interesting to note that of the $165.3 million  		in State supplementation payments made to disabled persons in January 1989,  		$67.6 million (40.9%) was made in the State of California alone. This is partly  		due to the high State benefit standard used in California, and also partly due  		to the fact that SSI recipients in California receive their food stamp  		allotments in their State supplementation payment through a "cash out"  		demonstration program.</p>

<p><b><i>3.10.2 Recent Trends</i></b></p>
<p>As shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-6">Exhibit 3-6</a>, the number of SSI  		disabled recipients has been increasing at a fairly consistent rate since 1982.  		The annual compound rate of growth (ACRG) between 1982 and 1988 was 4.9%, and  		in this time period, the average number of disabled persons receiving SSI  		payments increased by about 123,600 each year.</p>
<p>Total Federal SSI payments for persons with disabilities increased from  		$3.9 billion in 1980 to $9.0 billion in 1988, an average annual compound rate  		of growth of 11.1%. Annual State supplementation payments for the disabled  		increased from $1.1 billion to $2.0 billion over the same time period.

<p><a name="section3.10.3" id="section3.10.3"><b><i>3.10.3 Characteristics of Disabled SSI  		Recipients</i></b></a></p>
<p>Whereas almost two-thirds of disabled workers receiving Social Security  		Disability Insurance (DI) benefits are men, 58.4% of all disabled SSI  		beneficiaries are women. This is, no doubt, partly attributable to the fact  		that receipt of DI benefits is contingent upon prior participation in Social  		Security-covered employment, while receipt of SSI benefits is not.</p>

</tr></table><p>As shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-7">Exhibit 3-7</a>, SSI recipients also  		tend to be younger than DI recipients. This is partly due to the fact that  		receipt of SSI benefits does not require prior participation in the workforce,  		as well as the fact that SSI recipients are more likely to be persons who have  		been disabled since childhood (persons with mental retardation) or who became  		disabled in early adulthood (persons with schizophrenia and other chronic  		mental illnesses). In December 1987, there were approximately 280,000 disabled  		children receiving SSI benefits, accounting for about 9 percent of all disabled  		recipients.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Social Security program, persons who initially  		receive SSI benefits as "disabled" do not get re-classified as "aged" upon  		their 65th birthday by the Social Security Administration. About 19% of all  		disabled SSI recipients are over the age of 65. There are few disabled  		recipients over the age of 75, however, because: (1) the SSI program was  		initially implemented in 1974, so that disabled persons who were age 64 in 1974  		would only be 79 years of age in 1989; and (2) many disabled recipients lose  		their benefits when they are admitted to nursing homes, due to the lower SSI  		benefit standard applied in Medicaid-certified institutions.</p>

By December 1987, diagnosis data had been obtained for about  		77% of disabled recipients under the age of 65. These data indicate that  		approximately half of disabled SSI recipients under age 65 have a primary  		disabling condition related to their mental, rather than physical, functioning.  		Approximately 27% of all recipients have a primary disabling condition of  		mental retardation and approximately 24% have mental disorders other than  		mental retardation. Among SSI disabled children, mental retardation is the  		primary disabling condition of 42.5% of all recipients.</p>
<p>Additional data on the characteristics of disabled SSI recipients  		between the ages of 18 and 64 are available from the Survey of Income and  		Program Participation (SIPP) conducted in 1984.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note11">11</a></font></sup> These data indicate that 34% of disabled  		recipients in this age group were black, a much higher proportion than in the  		general population. Additionally, while only 19% were currently married, less  		than one in four lived alone. Approximately 50% of recipients between 18 and 64  		still lived as dependent children in their parents' households. These data  		suggest that many adult disabled SSI recipients are persons with mental  		retardation or mental illness who still live with their natural parents.</p>
<p><b><i>3.10.4 Participation in the section 1619 program</i></b></p>
<p>Of the 2.1 million disabled adults between the ages of 18 and 64  		receiving SSI benefits in September 1988, 33,155 (1.6%) were receiving special  		SSI benefits and/or Medicaid coverage under the section 1619 program. Section  		1619 participants are persons who would otherwise not be eligible for benefits  		due to the fact that they have either started to earn income or have returned  		to work. Compared to disabled SSI recipients not participating in the 1619  		program, 1619 participants are more likely to be: (a) younger; (b) white; (c)  		male; (d) have a diagnosis of mental retardation or mental illness; and (e) be  		receiving Social Security benefits.</p>
<p><b><i>3.10.5 Other income sources of disabled SSI recipients</i></b></p>
<p>Just over half of all SSI disabled recipients receive income from  		sources other than SSI. Approximately 37% receive Social Security benefits.  		These are persons whose Social Security benefits fall below Federal or State  		SSI benefit standards, and therefore receive SSI payments to bring their total  		cash assistance levels up to these standards. Note that not all of these  		persons are necessarily disabled workers receiving DI benefits. Some may be  		persons eligible for DI payments as adult disabled children, or persons  		receiving Social Security survivors' benefits as minor children, widows, or  		widowers.</p>
<p>Only about 5 percent of SSI disabled recipients have earned income.  		Another 10 percent have unearned income other than Social Security benefits.  		Just under half of all disabled recipients have no source of income other than  		SSI.</p>
<p><b><i>3.10.6 Termination of SSI benefits</i></b></p>
<p>In a recently-published longitudinal study of SSI recipients who were  		initially awarded SSI benefits during the period of October-December 1981, it  		was found that 41.7 percent of disabled recipients had become ineligible for  		benefits over a four-year follow-up period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note12">12</a></font></sup> The most frequent reason for the termination  		of SSI benefits was an increase in income due to receipt of Social Security  		benefits. Many persons had their SSI benefits terminated within the first six  		months, because there is a six-month waiting period required under the SSDI  		program between the established date of disability onset and the start of  		disability payments. Thus, many disabled SSDI applicants receive SSI payments  		during this waiting period until their SSDI benefits begin. Approximately 9  		percent of new SSI awardees died within the four-year follow-up period, while  		the remaining 17 percent of recipients left for a variety of other reasons such  		as excess income from other sources, admission to a public institution or  		Medicaid-certified facility, leaving the country, excess resources, cessation  		of disability, or failure to provide needed documentation at eligibility  		redeterminations.</p>
<h2><a name="VA" id="VA">CHAPTER 4. DISABILITY PROGRAMS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF  		VETERANS AFFAIRS</a></h2>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs administers a system of benefits for  		veterans and their dependents.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note13">13</a></font></sup> The Veterans Benefits Administration  		administers two main assistance programs for veterans with disabilities: (1)  		the Disability Compensation Program; and (2) the Disability Pension Program.  		The Disability Compensation Program provides benefits to veterans who suffer  		from disabling injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated while in military  		service (not necessarily during active combat). The Disability Pension Program  		provides benefits to veterans who are permanently and totally disabled, who  		have served during a designated wartime period, and who meet specific income  		and net worth criteria. It is a needs-based program for veterans whose  		disabilities are not related to military service. Estimated FY 1989 payments  		under the Disability Compensation Program were $8.5 billion, while estimated  		payments under the Disability Pension Program were $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>In addition to these two main compensation/pension programs for disabled  		veterans, the VA administers a variety of smaller programs offering vocational  		rehabilitation, employment services, housing assistance, and prosthetic and  		sensory aids to disabled veterans. Only the two major programs, the Disability  		Pension Program and the Disability Compensation Program, are described in this  		chapter.</p>
<h3>4.1 Disability Compensation Program</h3>
<p><i><b>4.1.1 Overview and Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The purpose of the Disability Compensation Program is to provide  		financial assistance to veterans with service-connected disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>4.1.2 Authorization, History and Funding</b></i></p>
<p>This 100% Federally funded program is authorized under Title 38 United  		States Code, 107, Chapters 11, 13, 51, 53, 55, and 61. Actual FY 1988 program  		expenditures were $8.68 billion; estimated FY 1989 program expenditures are  		$8.50 billion, and estimated FY 1990 expenditures are $8.89 billion.</p>
<p><i><b>4.1.3 Definition of Disability</b></i></p>
<p>In the Disability Compensation Program, disability is defined as a  		partial or total impairment by injury or disease incurred or aggravated during  		military service. A VA rating board employs criteria developed by the VA to  		rate the extent of a disability.</p>
<p><i><b>4.1.4 Administrative Structure</b></i></p>
<p>The program is administered by the Compensation and Pension Service of  		the Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs  		through 58 regional offices in each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto  		Rico, and the Republic of the Philippines. Each regional office has one or more  		rating boards, each composed of a physician and two nonmedical rating  		specialists, that determine eligibility for benefits.</p>
<p><i><b>4.1.5 Eligibility</b></i></p>
<p>Veterans are eligible for disability compensation if the disability was  		incurred or aggravated while on active duty. Unlike the VA Disability Pension  		Program, there are no income eligibility requirements and compensation is made  		for partial, as well as total, disability. The degree of disability is based on  		a Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which ranges from 0 to 100%. The severity  		of a disability is determined by using this rating schedule, which lists  		medical conditions and criteria for assigning each claimant a percentage  		disability rating. This rating is intended to represent an average earnings  		loss the veteran would experience in civilian occupations because of the  		disability. The rating is determined by a regional VA rating board based on the  		veteran's ability to function at work and at home. If a veteran has several  		impairments, each are rated separately and combined to determine an overall  		rating, taking into account the effects of multiple impairments.</p>
<p><i><b>4.1.6 Benefits Levels</b></i></p>
<p>Monthly cash payments are made to veterans awarded benefits under the  		Disability Compensation Program. Benefit levels are related to the percentage  		of disability determined by the VA rating board, which are assigned in  		increments of 10 percent (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit4-1">Exhibit 4-1</a>). The  		average annual benefit level for service-disabled veterans for FY 1987 was  		$3,808. For veterans determined to be 30% disabled or more, compensation is  		increased if they have dependents, if they are housebound, or if they require  		an aide and attendants allowance for in-home care. In 1987, the average annual  		compensation level for veterans determined to be 30% disabled or more was  		$7,416. For veterans determined to be less than 30% disabled, the average  		annual compensation was $1,032 (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit4-2">Exhibit 4-2</a>).  		There are limits on the amount veterans can receive based on the percentage of  		disability. In 1988, the maximum compensation for a veteran determined to be  		100% disabled with no dependents was $14,068.</p>

<p>The program is authorized under Title 38 United States Code, Chapters  		15, 51, 53, 55, and 61; 92 Stat. 2508. The program is 100% Federally funded  		through allocations to the VA. Actual FY 1988 program expenditures were $2.50  		billion. Estimated FY 1989 expenditures are $2.55 billion, and estimated FY  		1990 expenditures are $2.64 billion.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.3 Definition of Disability</b></i></p>
<p>Disability is defined as an injury or disease sustained outside of  		military service rendering a veteran permanently and totally impaired.  		Impairment is determined based on the veteran's ability to function at work and  		at home.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.4 Administrative Structure</b></i></p>
<p>The program is administered by the Compensation and Pension Service,  		Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, through 58  		regional offices.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.5 Eligibility</b></i></p>
<p>Veterans are eligible for disability pension benefits if the disability  		is nonservice-connected, if the veteran is either permanently or totally  		disabled, and if the veteran meets specific income and net worth criteria.  		Veterans who are at least 65 years of age are automatically considered  		permanently and totally disabled. In contrast, veterans under the age of 55  		must be rated as 100-percent disabled and be unable to engage in substantial  		gainful activity in order to be defined as permanently and totally disabled.  		Veterans between the ages of 55 and 59 must be rated as 60-percent disabled,  		and veterans between the ages of 60 through 64 must be rated as at least  		50-percent disabled in order to be considered permanently and totally  		disabled.</p>
<p>To establish eligibility for a pension, a veteran must file a claim with  		the VA regional office. If the veteran is under 65, the regional office then  		refers the veteran to a VA hospital for a medical examination evaluating the  		disability to see if it is permanent and total. The results of the medical  		examination are reviewed by a regional VA rating board which certifies that the  		veteran is permanently and totally disabled. The regional office may then grant  		the veteran a disability pension. The process takes approximately 120 days from  		the time the application is filed with the VA regional office to the time the  		veteran begins receiving payments.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.6 Benefits Levels</b></i></p>
<p>The average annual expenditure per case for nonservice-disabled veterans  		for FY 1987 was $3,865 (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit4-6">Exhibit 4-6</a>). The amount  		of the pension is related to the veteran's income level and their beneficiary  		class including whether it is the veteran or a spouse receiving the pension,  		the number of dependents, and whether or not the beneficiary is housebound  		and/or requiring an aid and attendants allowance for in-home care. There are  		limits on the amount the beneficiary can receive. For example in 1987, the  		maximum a veteran living alone could receive was $5,963 per year and the  		maximum for a veteran with one dependent was $7,811 per year.</p>

<p>Since civilian employees of the Federal government do not participate in  		the Social Security program, they are not eligible for Social Security  		Disability Insurance (DI) if they become disabled. Consequently, a separate  		system of disability compensation has been established for administering  		disability claims of Federal government employees. In general, the Federal  		Employees Compensation Program, administered by the Department of Labor, serves  		as a workmen's compensation insurance program for Federal workers, and pays  		short-term benefits for job-related injuries, while the Office of Personnel  		Management administers the Federal Civil Service Disability Program, which  		operates like the DI program, and generally covers long-term disability  		benefits for Federal civilian employees who become disabled and can no longer  		work.</p>
<h3>5.1 Federal Employees' Compensation Program</h3>
<p><i><b>5.1.1 Overview and Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The Federal Employees' Compensation Program pays compensation, medical,  		and survivor benefits to civilian employees of the United States government and  		to their dependents for job-related injuries and diseases.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.2 Authorization, History and Funding</b></i></p>
<p>This program is authorized under the Federal Employees, Compensation Act  		of 1966. An estimated $1.24 billion will be spent on Federal workman's  		compensation benefits in 1989 and $1.14 billion was spent in 1988.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.3 Definition of Disability</b></i></p>
<p>The program compensates for job-related injuries rendering an individual  		completely or partially disabled. Covered injuries include traumatic injuries,  		which occur at a specific place and time, and nontraumatic injuries, which are  		occupational diseases or illnesses occurring over a longer period than one  		workday. Covered injuries do not include those caused by willful misconduct, by  		intent to injure oneself or another, or by employee intoxication.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.4 Administrative Structure</b></i></p>
<p>The program is administered by the Department of Labor, Office of  		Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) through 13 district offices located  		across the United States.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.5 Eligibility</b></i></p>
<p>To be eligible for Federal workman's compensation an individual must 1)  		be a civilian employed by the United States government 2) sustain a job-related  		injury or disease and 3) report the injury within the time limit for the  		particular injury.</p>
<p>Reports of a traumatic injury must be filed within 30 days of the injury  		and reports of an occupational disease must be filed within 30 days of the  		employee's realization that the disease or illness was caused or aggravated by  		their work conditions. Claims for compensation must be filed within 3 years of  		the date of injury although OWCP may cover claims submitted later if the injury  		was documented in a written notice or by the employing agency.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.6 Services/Benefits Provided</b></i></p>
<p>Employees with traumatic injuries receive their regular salary for up to  		45 calendar days after the day of injury. Following this, compensation payments  		begin after a three-day waiting period that is not covered unless the  		disability is permanent or lasts more than 14 additional days.</p>
<p>The formula for the monthly, nontaxable compensation benefit is as  		follows: two-thirds of the employee pay rate if the individual has no  		dependents and three-fourths of the employee pay rate if the individual has one  		or more dependents. Dependents include spouse, children, children for whom the  		individual is paying child support, and dependent parents. An ex-spouse does  		not qualify as a dependent. The maximum annual rate is set at three-fourths of  		the highest rate of basic pay for GS-15 which is $56,250 per year. There is no  		limit on the number of years an individual can receive compensation but the  		OWCP will often require a yearly medical examination for individuals receiving  		extended disability compensation.</p>
<p>If a disabled individual can return to work at a lower pay rate, the  		individual can receive compensation for the loss of earning capacity resulting  		from the injury. The compensation is equal to two-thirds or three-fourths  		(depending on whether or not they have dependents) of the difference between  		what they were earning before and after the injury.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.7 Programs Interactions</b></i></p>
<p>Individuals cannot simultaneously receive disability compensation from  		OWCP and the Federal civil service disability program administered through the  		Office of Personnel Management (OPM), they must elect one or the other.  		However, if an individual chooses OPM disability compensation, OWCP will still  		cover the costs of medical treatment for a job-related injury. Individuals must  		choose between OWCP coverage and Veterans Administration coverage when the  		injury was originally service-connected and later aggravated on the job.  		However payments for non-service-connected disability or for a pension are  		allowed concurrently with benefits from OWCP both to the individual and his/her  		dependents. For OWCP benefits received after September 1974, compensation may  		be received concurrently with military retirement or retainer pay. An employee  		may receive Social Security Administration (SSA) payment and OWCP benefits  		concurrently as long as his/her total benefit does not exceed 80% of the  		employee's average earnings before he became disabled.

</tr></table><h3>5.2 Federal Civil Service-Disability Program</h3>
<p><i><b>5.2.1 Overview and Purpose</b></i></p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers two programs which  		provide monthly cash benefits to disabled employees of the U.S. government. The  		two programs, the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Program (CSRS) and  		the more recently enacted Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), both cover  		job-related and non-job-related disabilities. Individuals receiving  		compensation through OPM usually have non-job-related disabilities because  		job-related disabilities are covered more generously by the Federal Employee's  		Compensation Program administered by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.2 Authorization, History, and Funding</b></i></p>
<p>CSRS is authorized by the 1969 Civil Service Retirement Amendments to  		Chapter 83 of Title 5 of the United States Code. FERS is authorized under  		Chapter 84 of Title 5 by the more recent Federal Employees' Retirement System  		Act of 1986, Public Law 99-335. FERS was established in 1986 to help curb the  		rapidly escalating costs of the CSRS program. FERS was designed to achieve this  		by having FERS benefits reduced by Social Security Disability Insurance  		benefits so that a portion of the disability payments were shifted from the  		Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to the Social Security Disability  		Trust Fund. In 1986, $3.55 billion in benefits was administered to OPM  		disability beneficiaries.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.3 Definition of Disability</b></i></p>
<p>The OPM definition of disability is an employee who is "unable to render  		useful and efficient service because of disease or injury (1) in the employee's  		current position or (2) in a vacant position in the same agency at the same  		grade or pay level for which the individual is qualified for reassignment (5  		CFR Ch.1, 831.502)."</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.4 Administrative Structure</b></i></p>
<p>OPM administers both the CSRS and FERS programs. Disability applications  		are sent to OPM by either the employee or his or her department or agency and  		OPM makes the determination of eligibility.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.5 Eligibility</b></i></p>
<p>To be eligible for disability benefits through either the CSRS or FERS  		programs, a disabled individual must be a civilian employee of the U.S.  		government. Government employees with at least five years of service as of  		January 1, 1987 had the option to switch from CSRS to FERS between July 1 and  		December 31, 1987, but newer employees only have FERS as an option. To receive  		CSRS benefits an employee must have completed at least 5 years of service and  		to receive FERS benefits an employee must have completed at least 1.5 years of  		service and have earned Social Security work credit hours.</p>
<p>The procedure for applying for CSRS and FERS benefits is the same. An  		applicant for disability retirement must submit an application to OPM before  		leaving their job or within one year after leaving. Exceptions are made for  		employees found to be incompetent who are allowed to file up until a year after  		they have been restored to competency or a fiduciary is appointed, whichever is  		earlier.</p>
<p>A department or agency files for the employee when the employee is  		institutionalized or has no family or guardian, and the department or agency  		concludes that cause for unacceptable performance or conduct, or attendance is  		due to disease or injury. Before the employee is removed from service, the  		agency must notify the employee in writing that the agency is submitting a'  		disability retirement application for the employee to OPM and that the employee  		may review the application and submit one himself, in addition, if he  		desires.</p>
<p>OPM determines whether or not a claim will be granted based on  		documentation of various conditions of disability. To be classified as  		disabled, an individual must provide documentation of a medical condition which  		causes a deficiency in their job performance, conduct, or attendance. The  		condition must be expected to last at least a year and the agency must not be  		able to accommodate the individual's medical condition nor reassign them to a  		vacant position at the same grade or pay level.</p>
<p>Each disability annuitant under 60 years of age must be reexamined  		annually, unless OPM determines their disability is permanent. When a  		disability annuitant is found to have recovered, their annuity will be  		discontinued beginning one year from the date of the examination or the day of  		reemployment, whichever is first. Even if a disability annuitant has not been  		found to have recovered, if their income from wages and/or self-employment  		exceeds 80% of their earning capacity comparable to the rate of pay at the time  		of their retirement, payment of the annuity terminates 180 days after the end  		of the calendar year in which earning capacity was restored or upon  		reemployment to a position where their earning capacity is restored.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.6 Services/Benefits Provided</b></i></p>
<p>Computation of the annuity was changed under the FERS program from the  		method used under CSRS. As was noted earlier, this is one of the main  		differences between the disability programs. Under the CSRS, annuity is based  		on the number of years of service and the employee's average pay, which is the  		largest rate of pay calculated by averaging the employee's basic pay rate over  		any three consecutive years of service. The resulting annuity is a percentage  		of the employee's average pay, from 1.5 to 2.0%, depending on the number of  		years of service.</p>
<p>Under FERS, annuity is based solely on the employees average pay and  		does not take into account years of service. The annuity is 60% of the  		employee's average pay for the twelve months after the annuity begins or is  		restored, and 40% of the employee's average pay after that.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.7 Program Interactions</b></i></p>
<p>Individuals cannot receive disability compensation from the Federal  		Employees' Compensation Programs and the OPM disability programs at the same  		time, they must elect one or the other. Under FERS, but not CSRS, the annuity  		is reduced by 100% of the annuitant's Social Security disability insurance  		benefit for periods of concurrent coverage during the first year of FERS  		coverage and by 60% of the disability insurance for any time thereafter.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.8 Program Data</b></i></p>
<p>In FY 1985, there were 332,000 disability annuitants; in FY 1986, there  		were 326,000 annuitants; and in FY 1987, there were 318,000 annuitants. The  		data for the total number of disability annuitants is for annuitants from both  		the CSRS and FERS programs. Since FERS is a relatively new program, there has  		not been much activity as yet under FERS and most annuitants are covered by the  		CSRS program. <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit5-3">Exhibit 5-3</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit5-4">Exhibit 5-4</a> present the annual number of cases receiving  		benefits under both programs from 1980 onward, and annual payments made under  		the program through FY 1986, the most recent year for which payment data are  		available. Disability payments made in FY 1986 under both programs totalled  		$3.5 billion.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="BL" id="BL">CHAPTER 6. BLACK LUNG PROGRAM</a></h2>
<h3>6.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Black Lung program pays monthly cash benefits to coal miners who are  		totally disabled as a result of pneuomoconiosis, to widows of miners who died  		from Black Lung disease, and to their dependents.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>6.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>This program is authorized under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of  		1969 and the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972. The program was originally  		administered solely by the Social Security Administration (SSA) but beginning  		in 1973, under the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, the Department of Labor  		(DOL) took on responsibility for new claims. The program administered by SSA is  		referred to as the Part B program and is financed out of general revenues. The  		program for more recent and current claims is referred to as the Part C program  		and is financed out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. Total SSA benefit  		payments for miners, widows and dependents for 1988 were an estimated $904  		million and DOL payments for FY 1988 were $602 million.</p>
<p>The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is financed by an excise tax on  		domestically mined coal sold or used by the producer. The current tax rate is  		the lesser of: (1) $1.10 per ton of coal from underground mines plus $0.55 per  		ton of coal from surface mines; or (2) 4.4 percent of the total price for which  		the coal is sold. However, since its establishment in 1978, the Trust Fund has  		always operated at a deficit. Total revenue from the excise tax, plus interest  		and fines, was about $4.7 billion through 1988, while benefit payments and  		administrative expenses totalled about $6.6 billion, leaving a cumulative  		deficit of about $3 billion through 1988. Under current law, this deficit must  		be repaid from future Trust Fund revenues.</p>
<h3>6.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>Three general conditions must be met for a claim to be approved for  		black lung benefits: (1) the miner must have (or, if deceased, have had)  		pneumoconiosis; (2) the miner must be totally disabled by the disease (or must  		have been totally disabled at the time of death); and (3) the pneumoconiosis  		must have arisen out of coal mine employment.</p>
<h3>6.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>Two government agencies administer the Black Lung Program depending on  		when claims were initiated in a given case. The Department of Labor is  		responsible for all claims made by miners and their dependents, payable after  		July 1, 1973. The Social Security Administration handles claims payable before  		this date and survivor claims from these miners' relatives filed by December  		31, 1973 or within six months of the miner's death.</p>
<p>Application for black lung benefits can be filed at any Social Security  		office. Expect with respect to surviving children, no benefits can be paid for  		months before the application is filed.</p>
<h3>6.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>To be eligible for black lung benefits, an applicant must provide  		documentation that he or she was employed as a coal miner, has a medical  		diagnosis of pneumoconiosis, and is totally disabled by the disease. Total  		disability is defined as an inability to engage in comparable and gainful work  		by reason of pneumoconiosis which can be expected to result in death or which  		has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than  		12 months.</p>
<p>The definition of "comparable and gainful" work in the Black Lung  		program is less restrictive than the definition of "substantial gainful  		activity" employed in the SSDI and SSI programs since comparable and gainful  		work is defined as work "in the immediate area of residence requiring skills  		and abilities comparable to those of any work in a mine or mines in which the  		miner was previously engaged with some regulatory and over a substantial period  		of time." Thus, unlike disabled persons applying for SSDI or SSI, black lung  		applicants must only demonstrate an inability to perform <b>comparable</b> work  		<b>in the immediate area of residence</b>.</p>
<p>The 1972 amendments to the original legislation expanded coverage to  		surface as well as underground coal miners. Widows and dependents of miners  		with black lung disease can also qualify for benefits.</p>
<h3>6.6 Services/Benefit Provided</h3>
<p>The basic monthly benefit rate for disabled miners or their widows is  		37.5% of the monthly pay rate to Federal employees in grade GS-2. Effective  		January 1989, the basic benefit rate was $358.90 per month, and the maximum  		payment rate per family $717.80. The basic rate is adjusted for the number of  		qualified dependents according to the following formula: a 50% increase for one  		dependent, 75% for two dependents, and 100% increase for 3 or more dependents.  		The program has no income requirements, but the benefit level is offset for  		earnings above a certain threshold. In 1988 the benefit level for eligible  		miners was offset one dollar for every one dollar of annual taxable income over  		$6,021. For beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 years, the benefit offset rate was one  		dollar for every two dollars of annual taxable income above $8,400 and for  		beneficiaries 70 years or older, there was no offset.</p>
<p>Since Black Lung payments are tied indirectly to Federal employee pay  		scales, increases are automatically payable when Federal salaries are  		increased.</p>
<h3>6.7 Program Interactions</h3>
<p>Black lung benefits are not taxed by the Federal government, although  		States may do so.</p>
<p>Benefits are reduced (excluding benefits to widows and children) due to  		excess earnings in the same manner as Social Security benefits. In 1989,  		benefits for persons under age 65 are reduced $1 for each $2 in annual earnings  		in excess of $6,480; for persons aged 65-69 benefits are reduced for earnings  		in excess of $8,880. Black lung benefits are not reduced due to receipt of  		Social Security Disability insurance benefits or Supplemental Security Income  		(SSI) benefits.</p>
<p>Under Part B (benefits for claims made prior to July 1, 1973), benefits  		are reduced for payments received under State workers' compensation,  		unemployment compensation, or disability insurance laws, <b>if</b> such  		payments are for death or disability due to pneumoconiosis. Under Part C,  		benefits are reduced for State or Federal workers, compensation, but not for  		unemployment or disability insurance.</p>
<h3>6.8 Program Data</h3>
<p>In 1988, almost 400,000 individuals were paid black lung benefits.  		Approximately, 243,000 miners, survivors and dependents received benefits under  		the Part B program administered by the Social Security Administration, while  		149,000 persons received benefits under Part C administered by the Department  		of Labor. Surviving miners comprise only about 29 percent of total  		beneficiaries, while widows, surviving children, and dependents comprise 71  		percent of the beneficiary population. <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit6-1">Exhibit 6-1</a>  		presents the total number of Part B and Part C recipients of black lung  		benefits from 1980 to 1988.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="Medicare" id="Medicare">CHAPTER 7. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF PERSONS WITH  		DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<h3>7.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>Medicare is a Federally financed health insurance program for elderly  		and disabled persons who are insured under the Social Security program. The  		purpose of Medicare is to provide health insurance coverage for Social Security  		beneficiaries who have reached age 65 or who have left the workforce as a  		consequence of a disability. Medicare eligibility for disabled persons under  		age 65 is closely linked to eligibility for Social Security Disability  		Insurance (DI), although there is a two-year waiting period between award of DI  		benefits and eligibility for Medicare.</p>
<p>There are two major components to Medicare: (1) the hospital insurance  		(Part A) program; and 2) the supplementary insurance (Part B) program. In 1989,  		there were approximately 3.2 million disabled persons under age 65 covered  		under Medicare Part A and 2.9 million covered under Part B.</p>
<h3>7.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>Medicare was originally enacted on July 30, 1965 as Title XVIII of the  		Social Security Act. Originally, the program only covered persons aged 65 and  		over. Under 1972 amendments to the Act (P.L. 92-603) coverage was extended to  		persons entitled to Social Security benefits because of their disability and to  		certain individuals with end-stage renal disease. Various other legislative  		changes have been made to the Medicare program in recent years.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There are separate financing mechanisms for the two components of  		Medicare, and separate Trust Funds have been established for each component.  		The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A) is financed primarily through the  		Social Security payroll (FICA) tax on Social Security-covered employment.  		Employers and employees make equal contributions. In 1989, the tax rate for the  		HI Trust Fund was 1.45 percent of earnings up to $48,000 per employee. The  		taxable earnings base will continue to increase each year in accordance with  		increases in average earnings.</p>
<p>The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund (Part B) is  		voluntary and is financed partly from premiums paid by Part B enrollees and  		partly from general revenues. Premium income originally financed half of the  		Part B Trust Fund, but has since declined to the point of financing about 25  		percent of total Part B Trust Fund contributions. In 1989, the monthly premium  		for all Part B enrollees was $31.90. This premium is usually deducted from an  		enrollee's monthly Social Security benefits.</p>
<h3>7.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>Since eligibility for Medicare as a disabled enrollee under age 65 is  		linked to receipt of SSDI benefits, the definition of disability employed in  		determining eligibility for Medicare benefits is exactly the same definition  		employed in determining eligibility for SSDI benefits (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSDI">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p>There is one exception. Insured Social Security beneficiaries, or  		dependents of insured beneficiaries, are eligible for Medicare if they are  		medically determined to have end-stage renal disease. End-stage renal disease  		is defined as "that stage of kidney impairment that appears irreversible and  		permanent and requires a regular course of dialysis or kidney transplantation  		to maintain life." In the case of a dialysis patient, coverage begins in the  		third month after the month in which a course of renal dialysis is initiated  		(although the three-month waiting period can be waived if the individual  		participates in a self-care training program). For transplant patients,  		coverage can begin as early as the month in which the patient is hospitalized  		for transplantation, and continues until the 36th month after the transplant,  		if it is successful.</p>
<h3>7.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>Responsibility for administration of the Medicare program rests with the  		Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) within the Department of Health and  		Human Services. The Social Security Administration also plays a role in the  		administration of Medicare, primarily in the enrollment of beneficiaries and  		the maintenance of beneficiary rolls. For SSDI beneficiaries, enrollment in  		Medicare is automatic once the 24-month waiting period is reached.</p>
<p>HCFA contracts with fiscal intermediaries, which are usually insurance  		companies, to process and pay Medicare claims, and to perform other  		administrative and operational tasks for the program. HCFA also contracts with  		Peer Review Organizations (PROs), which include physician reviewers, to  		determine whether the health care services paid for by Medicare are reasonable  		and medically necessary, are furnished effectively in the most economical  		setting, and meet professional quality standards.</p>
<h3>7.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>In addition to persons with end-stage renal disease, there are three  		major categories of disabled social security beneficiaries who receive Medicare  		benefits prior to age 65:</p>
<ul><li>Disabled workers;</li>
<li>Disabled widows and widowers eligible for early benefits between the  		  ages of 50 and 65; and</li>
<li>Adult disabled children.</li>
</ul><p>Persons in all three categories must undergo a 24-month waiting period  		between the first award of social security benefits and entitlement to Medicare  		benefits. Medicare coverage begins on the first day of the 25th month of  		entitlement to social security benefits. Since there is a 5-month waiting  		period between the date of disability onset and the award of social security  		disability benefits, some disabled persons are not be entitled to Medicare  		coverage until the 30th month of their disability. Because persons receiving  		social security benefits as adult disabled children ate not eligible for these  		benefits until the age of 18, Medicare coverage of adult disabled children  		cannot begin until at least age 20.</p>
<p><i><b>7.5.1 Termination of Medicare benefits</b></i></p>
<p>If a disabled Medicare enrollee loses entitlement to DI benefits,  		because the enrollee's impairment has improved or ceased, then Medicare  		coverage terminates at the end of the month following the month in which he or  		she is notified of the termination of disability status. However, if an  		enrollee's DI benefits cease due to an increase in earnings, Medicare coverage  		can continue for up to 4 years, as long as the disability continues, as  		explained further below.</p>
<p><i><b>7.5.2 Work incentive provisions under Medicare</b></i></p>
<p>Since the threatened loss of health insurance benefits is considered a  		strong work disincentive, perhaps more so than the threatened loss of cash  		assistance benefits, there are a number of provisions in the social security  		program to continue Medicare coverage for disabled social security  		beneficiaries who attempt to work.</p>
<p>First, Medicare coverage continues throughout a beneficiary's "trial  		work" period. The trial work period is a period of up to nine months (not  		necessarily consecutive) in which disabled beneficiaries can earn more than $75  		per month without losing entitlement to their social security benefits.  		Further, Medicare coverage is extended for at least 39 months after completion  		of the trial work period, as long as the beneficiary is still determined  		disabled (4 years after the start of the trial work period). In other words, as  		long as a disabled beneficiary has no medical improvement in his or her  		condition, and remains disabled, then he or she can still receive Medicare  		coverage for at least 39 months after their cash benefits are terminated due to  		their ability to earn income on their own. Finally, if a disabled beneficiary  		attempts work and temporarily loses his or her entitlement to cash benefits,  		but then is forced to leave work and reapply for social security benefits, then  		the two-year waiting period for Medicare coverage is waived, as is the 5-month  		waiting period for DI benefits.</p>
<h3>7.6 Services Provided Under Medicare</h3>
<p>Benefits provided under Medicare are administered under two separate  		components: (1) the Hospital Insurance program (Part A); and (2) the  		supplementary insurance program (Part B). Persons eligible for Part A coverage  		are also eligible for Part B coverage, which requires payment of a monthly  		premium, and participation is voluntary.</p>
<p><i><b>7.6.1 Benefits Provided Under Part A</b></i></p>
<p>Disabled persons under age 65 are covered for the following health care  		expenses under Medicare Part A:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Inpatient hospital care</b>. Medicare covers all reasonable  			 charges for a medically-necessary in-patient acute-care hospital stay  			 prescribed by a physician. Medicare provides full coverage of inpatient  			 hospital care for the first 0 days per spell of illness, minus a deductible  			 (which in 1989, was $560).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note16">16</a></font></sup> From the 61st to the 90th day of a spell of  			 illness, Medicare provides partial hospital coverage; the beneficiary is liable  			 for coinsurance of one-fourth the deductible amount per day of coverage (e.g.  			 $140 per day in 1989), above which Medicare pays the balance. A beneficiary is  			 also eligible for a lifetime reserve of 60 days of inpatient hospital coverage  			 for use in any benefit period in which more than 90 days of hospital care has  			 been utilized. The coinsurance amount for these additional 60 days of coverage  			 is half the deductible ($280 in 1989). Medicare does not cover convenience  			 items, such as telephones or television rentals, or luxuries such as a private  			 room or private duty nursing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care</b>. Medicare will pay for up  			 to 100 days per spell of illness in a nursing home which is certified by  			 Medicare as a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Most nursing homes are not  			 Medicare-certified because they do not provide skilled nursing care. To qualify  			 for SNF coverage, the Medicare beneficiary must require continuous (not  			 intermittent) and skilled (not custodial) nursing care prescribed by a  			 physician. A SNF stay is also not covered unless the patient spent at least  			 three consecutive days in a hospital for a related condition within 30 days of  			 nursing home admission. Medicare provides full payment for covered stays for  			 the first 20 days of SNF care. For days 21 to 100, there is A Coinsurance  			 requirement equal to one-eighth the hospital deductible. In 1989, the  			 coinsurance requirement would have been $70 per day. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Home health care</b>. Medicare covers an unlimited number of  			 medically necessary home health visits by nurses, therapists and other health  			 care professionals under both Part A and Part B. To be eligible for services, a  			 beneficiary must: (a) require skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech  			 therapy; (b) be in need of "intermittent" care, as opposed to continuous care  			 (c) have that need certified by a physician under a home care plan; (d) be  			 confined to the home; and (e) receive services from a Medicare-certified home  			 health agency. A patient who needs full-time skilled nursing care over an  			 extended period of time would not qualify for home health benefits under the  			 "interrmittent" requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hospice care</b>. Medicare provides coverage for a broader  			 service benefit package for terminally ill beneficiaries with life expectancies  			 of six months or less. In accepting the hospice service benefit package,  			 enrollees must waive the right to traditional Medicare curative treatments.  			 There are small coinsurance requirements for drugs and in-home respite care  			 services. Medicare pays certified hospice care providers a prospective payment  			 amount for various categories of hospice care, subject to an annual "cost cap"  			 for each hospice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inpatient psychiatric care</b>. Medicare coverage for inpatient  			 psychiatric care is generally the same as coverage of inpatient medical care,  			 except that benefits are limited to 190 days of care in the beneficiary's  			 lifetime. If a beneficiary is an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital at the  			 time he or she becomes eligible for Medicare coverage, certain restrictions  			 apply.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>7.6.2 Benefits Provided Under Part B</b></i></p>
<p>Of the 3.2 million disabled persons receiving Medicare benefits under  		Part A, about 2.9 million (93%) are also covered under Part B. For Part B  		services, Medicare pays 80% of reasonable charges after an annual deductible of  		$75. The monthly premium for Part B services in 1989 was $31.90 per month.  		Medicare services provided under Part B include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Physician's services</b>. Medicare covers medical and surgical  			 services provided by physicians, as well as ancillary services provided in a  			 doctor's office. Routine services, such as routine physical examinations and  			 eye and ear exams, are not covered. Limitations also apply to services provided  			 by dentists, podiatrists, chiropractors, and the treatment of mental  			 illness.</p>
<p>Most physicians agree to accept Medicare's approved charges for  			 physician services as payment in full. This is called "accepting assignment"  			 For services provided by these physicians, enrollees must only pay the 20%  			 coinsurance amount on approved charges. Other physicians, however, do not  			 accept assignment, and charge more than the Medicare approved charge. For  			 services provided by these physicians, enrollees must pay the 20% coinsurance  			 amount of the approved charge, plus any additional charges above the Medicare  			 approved charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Other medical and health services</b>. Part B covered services  			 also include laboratory and other diagnostic tests, home health services, X-ray  			 and other radiation therapy services, hospital outpatient services, home  			 dialysis equipment and supplies, prosthetic devices, immunosuppressive drugs,  			 physical and speech therapy, and ambulance services.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="section7.7" id="section7.7">7.7 Recent Program History and  		Legislative Changes</a></h3>
<p>In efforts to slow the growth of Medicare program expenditures, while  		maintaining the scope and quality of Medicare benefits for enrollees, myriad  		legislative changes are made to the Medicare program each year. The Medicare  		Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 provided for the greatest expansion of  		Medicare benefits since the program was originally enacted in 1965, but  		political resistance to the financing structure of the bill led to its repeal  		in 1989. This report will not attempt to describe all the recent changes which  		have been made to the Medicare program, but a recent change which specifically  		affects disabled Medicare enrollees under age 65 is described below.</p>
<p><i><b>7.7.1 Medicare as secondary payer for certain disabled Medicare  		enrollees</b></i></p>
<p>Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, effective January  		1987, Medicare became the secondary payer for disabled Medicare enrollees who  		are covered by a "large group health care plan." A large group health care plan  		is defined as an employer with 100 or more employees. This provision also  		applies to dependents of employees covered by a large group plan. Thus, for  		example, if an employee receives full family coverage under his group plan and  		his working spouse becomes disabled and subsequently entitled to Medicare  		benefits, Medicare becomes the secondary payer for all health care services  		which are covered both by the employer group plan and by Medicare. This  		provision does not apply to elderly Medicare enrollees who are also covered by  		a private health insurance plan.</p>
<p>This provision shifted some health care costs from the Medicare program  		to private health insurance plans for disabled enrollees covered by more than  		one plan. Note that it may be financially beneficial for a disabled Medicare  		enrollee to maintain coverage under a group health plan if employee  		contributions to the group plan are less than Medicare Part B premiums, and/or  		if the group plan provides broader coverage with fewer deductibles and  		copayments requirements than Medicare.</p>
<h3>7.8 Program Interactions</h3>
<p><i><b>7.8.1 Social Security Disability Insurance</b></i></p>
<p>Enrollment in Medicare by persons under age 65 is predicated upon  		entitlement to social security disability (DI) benefits, with the exception of  		persons with end-stage renal disease, who can become eligible for Medicare  		without receiving social security. Changes in policies regarding the  		eligibility of disabled persons under age 65 for DI benefits therefore impact  		enrollment and expenditures in the Medicare program.</p>
<p><i><b>7.8.2 Interaction of Medicare and Medicaid Among the  		Disabled</b></i></p>
<p>Approximately 25-30% of all disabled Medicare enrollees under age 65 are  		also covered by Medicaid. A disabled social security beneficiary entitled to  		Medicare benefits may also be entitled to full or partial Medicaid benefits  		through a variety of eligibility pathways, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>DI recipients whose social security benefits fall below Federal  			 and/or State SSI benefit standards, and who therefore also receive monthly SSI  			 cash payments, are generally eligible for Medicaid by virtue of their receipt  			 of SSI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DI recipients with incomes above SSI benefit standards may  			 nonetheless qualify for Medicaid under a higher "medically needy" income level  			 in the 36 States (including the District of Columbia) which have medically  			 needy programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DI recipients with incomes above SSI benefit standards may qualify  			 for Medicaid under a State Medicaid option to extend eligibility to all elderly  			 and disabled persons with incomes below the poverty threshold. As of July 1989,  			 three States (New Jersey, Florida and the District of Columbia) had elected  			 this option. New Jersey and Florida have set their Medicaid eligibility levels  			 at 100% of the poverty level, while Florida has set its level at 90% of  			 poverty. Two other States (Alaska and California) already have SSI/SSP benefit  			 standards above the poverty level due to their State supplementation of  			 SSI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disabled Medicare enrollees with substantial out-of-pocket expenses  			 for medical care services not covered by Medicare (including Medicare premiums,  			 deductibles and coinsurance requirements) may qualify for medical assistance  			 under Medicaid "spend-down" provisions. Under spend-down, out-of-pocket medical  			 costs are deducted from applicants' incomes until their incomes are lowered to  			 the medically needy threshold. These spend-down provisions apply both in States  			 which have medically needy programs and in States which have elected the  			 so-called Section 209(b) option.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, through these various Medicaid eligibility provisions, some  		disabled Medicare enrollees may be permanent enrollees in Medicaid (e.g. if  		they also receive SSI cash assistance) or they may receive medical assistance  		through Medicaid on a more temporary basis (e.g. if they have substantial  		health care expenses not covered by Medicare over a short time period). Also,  		since there is a 24-month waiting period between intitial receipt of DI  		benefits and entitlement to Medicare, some DI beneficiaries receive Medicaid  		coverage during the 24-month waiting period. One recent study indicated that  		about 14 percent of DI beneficiaries had Medicaid coverage during the last six  		months of the Medicare waiting period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Under a provision of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act that was not  		repealed, disabled Medicare enrollees with incomes below the poverty level (and  		who are otherwise not eligible for Medicaid) will be universally entitled to  		limited Medicaid benefits. The Act mandates that effective January 1989 all  		State Medicaid programs must pay the Medicare Part B premiums, coinsurance and  		deductibles for all elderly and disabled Medicare enrollees with incomes up to  		85% of the poverty threshold (and resources at or below twice the standard used  		in the SSI program). This mandate will be expanded to include all elderly and  		disabled persons with incomes up to 100% of poverty by January 1992. For these  		disabled Medicare enrollees, Medicaid benefits will be limited to payment of  		Medicare premiums, deductibles and coinsurance requirements; they will not be  		eligible for other services covered by the State Medicaid plan. This provision  		also applies to deductibles and coinsurance requirements for outpatient  		prescription drugs, when that coverage is phased into the Medicare program in  		January 1991.</p>
<p>Medicaid is always the payer of last resort, so that Medicare provides  		first payer coverage for all services covered by both programs.</p>
<p><i><b>7.8.3 Interaction with other Federal payers</b></i></p>
<p>If a disabled person is eligible for health care benefits from both  		Medicare and from the Veterans' Administration (VA), the VA is generally the  		first payer. Any service that is authorized by the VA and for which the  		provider bills the VA directly, the provider must accept the VA's payment as  		payment in full, and Medicare cannot be billed for any supplementary charges.  		However, if the provider does not accept the VA's authorization, and the bill  		is submitted to the VA directly by the disabled veteran, Medicare will pay the  		difference between the VA payment and the Medicare approved charge, to the  		extent that the VA payment is less than the Medicare payment would be. Medicare  		may also pay for services if the disabled veteran chooses to bill Medicare  		instead of the VA.</p>
<p>For disabled persons who are eligible for health care benefits under  		both Medicare and CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed  		Services), Medicare is the primary payer and CHAMPUS generally supplements  		Medicare by paying the Medicare deductibles and coinsurance amounts, plus any  		benefits that may be covered by CHAMPUS but not Medicare.</p>
<p>Prior to 1983, Federal employees who were covered both by the Federal  		Employees Health Benefits Program and by Medicare (due to non-federal work),  		Medicare was the primary payer. Beginning in 1983, Federal workers began paying  		the Medicare (HI) payroll tax and, accordingly, becoming eligible for Medicare  		based on Federal quarters of employment. However, the Federal government health  		benefits program is now considered an employer group health plan, and for  		disabled Medicare enrollees who are still covered under the plan, Medicare is  		now the secondary payer, as discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section7.7">Section  		7.7</a>.</p>
<h3>7.9 Special Issues</h3>
<p><i><b>7.9.1 Should the  		two-year waiting period for Medicare coverage be eliminated or  		reduced?</b></i></p>
<p>The most debated issue in regard to Medicare's coverage of the disabled  		is undoubtedly the proposed elimination of the two-year waiting period. When  		Medicare coverage was extended to DI beneficiaries in 1973, the two-year  		waiting period was enacted primarily to limit program costs. There was an  		assumption that many disabled workers retain private health insurance coverage  		after the onset of their disability, and that without a waiting period for  		Medicare coverage, many of these private health insurance costs would be  		shifted to Medicare.</p>
<p>In a recent study by the Social Security Administration, it was  		estimated that elimination of the two-year waiting period for Medicare coverage  		would result in significantly increased costs to the Medicare trust  		fund.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note18">18</a></font></sup> Assuming that  		Medicare would be the primary payer during the two-year waiting period, the  		study estimated that the average 10-year cost per disabled beneficiary would  		increase by 45 percent if the waiting period were eliminated. Thirty percent of  		the estimated increase was attributable to persons who die within the first two  		years of their entitlement to SSDI benefits.</p>
<p>A related issue is the degree to which SSDI beneficiaries are covered by  		some other health insurance plan during their waiting period for Medicare  		coverage. In a 1982 survey of new disabled-worker beneficiaries who had been  		receiving DI benefits for at least 18 months, 73 percent of those in the 18-24  		month period reported some form of health insurance coverage. About 54 percent  		reported some private or other coverage, 14 percent reported Medicaid coverage,  		and about 12 percent reported coverage under CHAMPUS. Twenty-seven percent  		reported no health insurance coverage.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note19">19</a></font></sup> Older DI beneficiaries in the two-year  		waiting period were more likely to have health insurance than younger  		beneficiaries. The cost of eliminating the two-year waiting period would be  		much lower if Medicare was not the primary payer during this interval, although  		concurrent legislation would have to be enacted to prevent private employers  		and other insurers from reducing their coverage provisions in response to  		expanded Medicare coverage.</p>
<p>Another proposal has been to eliminate the two-year waiting period for  		only certain DI beneficiaries with high health care costs, for example, persons  		with AIDS. This proposal has been opposed by those who believe that such a  		policy would not be equitable to other DI beneficiaries with equally severe  		medical conditions and high medical care costs.</p>
<p><i><b>7.9.2 Medicare and AIDs</b></i></p>
<p>The 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage is particularly  		relevant to the issue of health insurance coverage for persons with AIDs. Many  		persons with AIDs are persons who have achieved insured status under the Social  		Security program, who become eligible for DI benefits after contracting AIDs  		and are unable to continue working, but who are left without adequate health  		insurance coverage while waiting for their entitlement to Medicare. The  		Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) required that  		employers provide employees with the option of purchasing health insurance  		coverage after leaving their jobs if the employee pays the full group premium,  		but under present law, this option is only available for up to 18 months after  		leaving employment. Moreover, the cost of paying the full premium cost of group  		insurance may be beyond the ability of many persons with AIDs if they are  		unemployed and relying on DI benefits as their sole source of income.  		Consequently, many persons with AIDs are incurring catastrophic health care  		costs related to the care of their illness and becoming eligible for Medicaid  		after their resources are depleted. Many persons with AIDs also die within the  		24-month waiting period without gaining entitlement to Medicare coverage at  		all.</p>
<h3>7.10 Program Data</h3>
<p><i><b>7.10.1 Current Medicare disabled enrollees, expenditures, and  		costs.</b></i></p>
<p>Estimated FY 1989 data on Medicare disabled enrollees, expenditures, and  		costs per recipient are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit7-1">Exhibit 7-1</a>. In  		1989, the average monthly number of Medicare disabled beneficiaries enrolled in  		Part A was 3,153,000. Of these, approximately 2,922,000 (93%) were also  		enrolled in Part B. Disabled Medicare enrollees under age 65 account for about  		10% of the total Medicare population. Since Part A mainly provides coverage of  		inpatient hospital care, only about 25% of Part A disabled enrollees actually  		used a Part A-covered service, whereas 78% of Part B enrollees had at least one  		paid claim for a Part B service.</p>
<p>Average annual expenditures per disabled enrollee under Part A was about  		$1,994, about 15% higher than the average cost per Medicare enrollee over the  		age of 65, which was $1,727. This is not surprising given that Medicare  		enrollees under age 65 are, by definition, functionally impaired, whereas most  		Medicare enrollees over the age of 65 are not. Average Medicare payments under  		Part B for disabled enrollees were about $1,426, about 20% higher than average  		Part B payments for aged enrollees. Estimated total expenditures for the  		Medicare disabled in 1989 were $10.5 billion, about 11% of total Medicare  		program outlays.</p>

<p>As would be expected, trends in the Medicare disabled population reflect  		trends in the SSDI population. The number of Medicare disabled enrollees from  		1980 through 1989 is presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit7-2">Exhibit 7-2</a>.  		Reflecting the decline in the number of disabled persons receiving SSDI  		benefits in the early 1980s, the number of Medicare disabled enrollees also  		declined slightly, but in recent years the disabled Medicare population has  		been growing at about an average annual rate of about 2.0 percent, or about  		60,000 enrollees per year.</p>
<p>Medicare expenditures for disabled enrollees increased at an average  		annual compound rate of growth of 10.7% between 1980 and 1987, increasing from  		$4.5 billion to $9.1 billion. Expenditure data presented in  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit7-2">Exhibit 7-2</a> for FY 1988 and 1989 are estimated, and  		are subject to revision.</p>
<p><b><i>7.10.3 Characteristics of Medicare Disabled Enrollees</i></b></p>
<p>The characteristics of the Medicare disabled population are similar to  		those of the SSDI population (see Section 2.9.3), with the exception that  		dependents of SSDI disabled workers are not eligible for Medicare benefits, and  		the Medicare disabled population includes a relatively small number of persons  		with end-stage renal disease who do not receive SSDI benefits.</p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit7-3">Exhibit 7-3</a> shows the distribution of the  		Medicare disabled population by major population category. Of approximately 3  		million Medicare disabled enrollees in 1987, 79.3% were disabled workers, 16.7%  		were adult disabled children, 2.5% were disabled widows or widowers, and 1.6%  		were persons with end-stage renal disease not otherwise eligible for Medicare  		benefits.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note20">20</a></font></sup> Almost half  		(46%) of the Medicare disabled are between the ages of 55 and 64.</p>

<p>Payments for inpatient hospital care account for 57 percent of total  		Medicare expenditures for the disabled. Payments to physicians account for 24  		percent of expenditures, and outpatient hospital expenditures (including  		dialysis treatment for end-stage renal disease patients) account for 14  		percent. Other Medicare-covered services account for the remaining 5 percent of  		expenditures.

<p>Persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are a unique sub-group  		within the total Medicare disabled population.

</tr></table><h2><a name="Medicaid" id="Medicaid">CHAPTER 8. MEDICAID COVERAGE OF PERSONS WITH  		DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<h3>8.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>Medicaid is a joint Federal and State entitlement program that provides  		medical assistance to persons and families with low incomes. Unlike Medicare,  		which is a Federally-administered program with uniform eligibility rules and  		benefits nationwide, individual States design and administer their own Medicaid  		programs within broad Federal guidelines. As a result, there is considerable  		variation across States with regard to who is eligible to receive medical  		assistance under Medicaid and with regard the services that are covered by each  		State Medicaid program.</p>
<p>Another important distinction between Medicare and Medicaid is that  		Medicaid is a means-tested program designed to provide assistance to persons  		who are financially needy, while Medicare is a social insurance program based  		on participation in the workforce. The Medicaid program is extremely complex,  		and this chapter can only provide a broad overview of how persons with  		disabilities may receive medical assistance through the program.</p>
<p>In 1989, approximately 24.7 million persons received Medicaid-funded  		services under the program.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note21">21</a></font></sup> Of these, about 3.6 million (15%) were  		eligible for Medicaid on the basis of their disability. However, persons with  		disabilities account for a much larger proportion of total program  		expenditures. Approximately $16.5 billion of the estimated $45.1 billion in  		1987 Medicaid spending, about 36% of total program expenditures, were payments  		for services provided to persons with disabilities.</p>

<p>The Medicaid program was originally enacted under Title XIX of the  		Social Security Amendments of 1965, the same legislation which established the  		Medicare program. Medicaid was a modification and expansion of several  		preexisting programs which provided medical payments for certain groups of  		needy individuals.</p>
<p>Since 1965, the Medicaid program has undergone many legislative changes,  		particularly in recent years. Eligibility for Medicaid coverage was initially  		closely linked to eligibility for cash assistance under the Aid to Families  		with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and the Supplemental Security Income  		(SSI) program. Although Medicaid eligibility retains strong ties to these two  		programs, there has been a gradual loosening of these ties to expand Medicaid  		coverage to other poor persons who do not necessarily receive cash assistance  		through SSI or AFDC. Another major development in the Medicaid program is that  		although it was originally enacted, like Medicare, as a health insurance  		program for acute health care needs, it has now become the nation's primary  		program or financing long term care services to elderly and disabled  		individuals. Payments for long term care services account for about half of all  		Medicaid program spending.</p>
<p>The Medicaid program is jointly financed by the Federal government and  		by the States. The Federal government's share of State Medicaid payments is  		known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is  		recalculated annually and is related to State per capita income, such that  		poorer States receive a higher FMAP than wealthier States. FMAP rates for FY  		1989 are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit8-1">Exhibit 8-1</a>. In 1987, the  		Federal government paid 55.6% of all paid Medicaid claims to service vendors.  		The Federal government also pays for 50 percent of all State Medicaid  		administrative costs, although higher rates are applicable for specific  		administrative activities.</p>
<p>The non-Federal portion of State Medicaid payments can be financed  		entirely through State funds, or, alternatively States may require local  		governments to participate in Medicaid program financing. In 1986, fourteen  		States required some local funding of Medicaid program costs.</p>

<p>The definition of disability used in determining eligibility for  		Medicaid is the same definition employed by the Social Security Administration  		in determining eligibility for SSDI, SSI and Medicare. Most disabled persons  		receiving Medicaid coverage do so on the basis of their receipt of cash  		assistance under the SSI program, and have therefore been determined disabled  		by their State Disability Determination Service (DDS). Disabled persons who do  		<b>not</b> receive SSI cash assistance due to excess income and/or resources,  		but who nonetheless may be eligible for Medicaid coverage under other  		eligibility provisions must also be determined disabled by the same  		process.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Three State Medicaid programs, however, employ more restrictive  		disability criteria in determining eligibility for Medicaid than are used in  		determining eligibility for SSI. These States--Indiana, Missouri, and New  		Hampshire--are allowed to do so under the so-called "Section 209(b)" Medicaid  		program option. Indiana and New Hampshire require that a disability be  		"permanent and total" and Missouri and New Hampshire do not extend Medicaid  		coverage to children under age 18, even though they may be receiving SSI  		benefits as disabled children.</p>
<p>One definition of disability relates to that definition used to  		determine who is eligible for coverage under the Medicaid program. As in  		Medicare, however, other definitions of disability or impairment are often used  		in determining whether Medicaid enrollees are eligible to receive specific  		types of services. State Medicaid programs may use functional criteria for  		coverage of nursing home services, home health services, personal care  		services, home and community-based waiver services, and other Medicaid-covered  		services. Thus, two levels of disability criteria are applied--one in  		determining eligibility for the Medicaid program in general, and one used in  		determining eligibility for specific covered services.</p>
<h3>8.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>Each State designates a single agency to administer its Medicaid program  		under the general oversight of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)  		in the Department of Health and Human Services. The responsibilities of the  		single State agency include: eligibility determinations, certification of  		Medicaid providers, payment of Medicaid claims, review and inspection of  		facilities providing care, as well as maintaining the overall integrity and  		administration of the Medicaid program.</p>
<p>Congress and HCFA also play important roles in the administration of the  		Medicaid program. Although individual States have a good deal of flexibility in  		the design and operation of their Medicaid programs, the Federal government  		still establishes the broader parameters of Medicaid program policy. Federal  		law determines which groups of persons States <b>must</b> and <b>may</b> cover,  		at their option, as well as what services States <b>must</b> and <b>may</b>  		provide to Medicaid beneficiaries.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note23">23</a></font></sup> The Federal government, through law and  		regulation, provides broad definitions of Medicaid-covered services, and also  		minimum standards for Medicaid providers and the services they provide. HCFA  		conducts various monitoring activities of State Medicaid programs to ensure  		that they are administering the program in compliance with Federal law and  		regulations.</p>
<h3>8.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>Medicaid eligibility policy is extremely complex and varies from State  		to State. Persons with comparable disabilities and in equal financial  		circumstances can be eligible for Medicaid in one State but not in another.  		While this section cannot possibly provide a detailed explanation of Medicaid  		eligibility policy, and its various pertubations from State to State, it will  		attempt to provide an overview of how persons with disabilities can become  		eligible for medical assistance under various State Medicaid program  		options.</p>
<p>In all cases, persons who receive Medicaid coverage must meet both  		<b>categorical</b> and <b>financial</b> eligibility criteria. Categorical  		criteria refer to the various <b>groups</b> of persons who are potentially  		eligible for Medicaid, while <b>financial</b> criteria refer to the level of  		financial need which is used in determining eligibility. Since disabled persons  		(defined as persons who pass the DDS disability determination process) are a  		mandated categorical group, disabled persons of any age are potentially  		eligible for Medicaid if they meet the State's financial eligibility  		criteria.</p>
<p><i><b>8.5.1 SSI eligibility links to Medicaid</b></i></p>
<p>Most disabled persons are eligible for Medicaid by virtue of their  		receipt of cash assistance from SSI and/or optional State supplementation  		(SSP). Almost four of five (79%) disabled persons on Medicaid receive SSI/SSP  		cash assistance. As discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSI">Chapter 3</a>, however, a  		disabled person's eligibility for SSI/SSP is related to the income level at  		which States set their optional supplementation standards. Thus, eligibility  		for Medicaid is, in part, related to the characteristics of each State's  		optional supplementation program.</p>

</tr></table><p>Not all disabled persons who receive SSI or optional State  		supplementation payments are necessarily eligible for Medicaid, however. State  		Medicaid programs have three options with regard to extending Medicaid  		eligibility Medicaid to SSI recipients. Under the "Section 1634" option, SSI  		recipients are automatically enrolled in Medicaid, without having to make a  		separate application. As shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit8-2">Exhibit 8-2</a>, thirty  		States have elected this option. Under the second option, SSI recipients are  		automatically eligible for Medicaid, but they must make a separate application  		to the State agency which administers the Medicaid program. Six States (Alaska,  		Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada and Oregon) have elected this option.</p>
<p>Under the third and most restrictive option, referred to as the Section  		"209(b)" option, States may impose more restrictive eligibility criteria for  		Medicaid than are used in determining eligibility for SSI, as long as the  		criteria were used in the State Medicaid program prior to 1972 (when the SSI  		program was enacted). States may impose more restrictive criteria in  		determining disability, and/or more restrictive income and assets criteria. As  		previously discussed, three States (Indiana, Missouri, and New Hampshire) have  		elected to apply more restrictive definitions of disability in determining  		eligibility for Medicaid than are used for SSI eligibility determinations.  		Eleven other "209(b)" States (Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota,  		Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, and Virginia)  		used the same definition of disability, but employ more restrictive financial  		criteria than SSI in determining Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p><a name="section8.5.2" id="section8.5.2"><i><b>8.5.2 Medicaid eligibility of persons not  		receiving SSI/SSP</b></i></a></p>
<p>For disabled persons who do not receive SSI or optional State  		supplementation payments, there are a number of Medicaid program options which  		extend eligibility to the "non-cash" disabled. Approximately 20% of all  		categorically-related disabled persons receiving Medicaid do not receive SSI  		cash assistance and are eligible for Medicaid under these other program  		options. The most common eligibility provisions under which these disabled  		persons qualify for Medicaid are:</p>
<p><b>Medically Needy Programs</b>. Thirty-six (36) States extend Medicaid  		coverage to certain "medically needy" individuals whose income and/or resources  		exceed the levels established for SSI/SSP cash assistance, but who nonetheless  		require medical assistance. States which have elected to cover the medically  		needy establish income and resource standards for these recipients which are  		different from those used in determining eligibility for SSI. However, by  		Federal law, the medically needy income standard cannot exceed 133% of the  		State AFDC income standard for a similarly sized family. Further, individuals  		with incomes above the medically needy standard may reduce his or her income to  		the requisite level through eligible deductions for medical care. This process  		is called "spending-down." For example, if an individual's countable income is  		$500, and the State's medically needy income standard is $400, the individual  		would be required to incur $100 in medical care costs (i.e. the spend-down)  		prior to establishing eligibility for Medicaid. Once a medically needy  		applicant meets his or her spend-down obligation (the difference between the  		medically needy income standard and the person's monthly countable income), he  		or she becomes eligible for Medicaid for the remainder the eligibility  		period.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Special Income Levels for the Institutionalized</b>. The SSI benefit  		standard for persons in Medicaid-certified institutions is just $30, so States  		may extend Medicaid eligibility to persons in institutions with incomes which  		do not exceed a special income level. This income level, established by the  		State, cannot exceed 300% of the Federal SSI benefit level. In 1989, the  		maximum level was $1,104 (3 x $368) per month. For persons with incomes up to  		the special income level, this provision works like a medically needy  		spend-down for the institutionalized: recipients must contribute all income in  		excess of the SSI personal needs allowance of $30 per month towards the cost of  		their care, after which Medicaid pays the balance of the bill (up to the  		Medicaid-approved rate). States which do not have a medically needy program use  		this provision to provide medical assistance to persons in nursing homes who  		have some income, but not sufficient income to pay for their own nursing home  		care. Many persons who receive SSI cash assistance prior to nursing home  		admission lose their eligibility for SSI upon admission (because their income  		exceeds the SSI institutional benefit standard of $30 per month) but remain  		eligible for Medicaid as "non-cash" recipients under this provision.</p>
<p><b>Higher Income Levels for the Aped and Disabled</b>. Under the Omnibus  		Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, States were authorized to establish Medicaid  		eligibility income levels for the aged and disabled up to 100 percent of the  		Federal poverty level, effective July 1, 1987. This provision marked the first  		time that States could establish Medicaid eligibility levels that were not tied  		to benefit standards used in their SSI/SSP or AFDC programs. As of July 1989,  		two States and the District of Columbia had elected to establish higher  		Medicaid eligibility levels for the aged and disabled under this option: the  		District of Columbia and New Jersey had established their income levels at 100  		percent of the poverty level, while Florida had set its income level at 90  		percent of the poverty level.</p>
<p><b>Optional Coverage of Noninstitutionalized Disabled Children</b>. This  		provision allows States to extend Medicaid eligibility to certain disabled  		children who would otherwise not be eligible for Medicaid due to the deeming of  		parental income and resources.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note25">25</a></font></sup> Under a Medicaid program modification  		enacted in 1982, States may waive Medicaid deeming rules for disabled children  		who meet the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>the child would be eligible for Medicaid if institutionalized;</li>
<li>the child meets the State's Level of Care criteria for hospital care,  		  nursing home care, or ICF-MR (Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally  		  Retarded) care;</li>
<li>the child can be appropriately cared for outside of an institutional  		  setting; and</li>
<li>the estimated cost of care at home is no more than the estimated cost  		  of institutional care.</li>
</ul><p>This provision essentially allows States to extend Medicaid eligibility  		to all disabled children, regardless of family income status, as long as their  		disabilities are severe enough to qualify for institutional placement. As of  		July 1989, 19 States and the District of Columbia had elected to use this  		option to extend Medicaid eligibility to certain disabled children.</p>
<p><b>Expanded Eligibility Options under the Section 2176 Home and  		Community-Based Care Medicaid Waiver Program</b>. Under the Omnibus Budget  		Reconciliation Act of 1981, States were authorized to apply for special  		Medicaid waivers to provide coverage of home and community-based services not  		otherwise included in the State Medicaid plan for persons at risk of  		institutional placement. Although the major provision of these waivers is an  		expansion in Medicaid service benefits, not an expansion in Medicaid  		eligibility, States may also apply special Medicaid eligibility provisions in  		their Section 2176 Medicaid waiver programs. These eligibility provisions  		include: (1) waiving Medicaid deeming rules for persons who are otherwise  		eligible for waiver services; and (2) applying the institutional "special  		income level" in determining the financial eligibility of waiver applicants.  		Thus, certain disabled persons living in non-institutional settings may become  		eligible for Medicaid under these special waiver program options <b>if</b> they  		would have been eligible for Medicaid upon entering an institution. Not only  		are these persons eligible for the benefit package provided for under the  		regular State Medicaid plan, but they are also eligible for the supplemental  		home and community-based "waiver" services provided under this Medicaid program  		option.</p>
<p><b>Section 1619 Recipients</b>. Under the provisions of Section 1619(a)  		and 1619(b) of the Social Security Act, disabled SSI recipients who enter the  		work force are eligible for continued SSI benefits and Medicaid eligibility  		status as long as there is not a medical improvement in their disabling  		condition. Under Section 1619(a), disabled persons with earnings can continue  		to receive SSI benefits as long as their countable earnings fall below the  		so-called "breakeven point." Disabled recipients with earnings above this level  		can continue to be eligible for Medicaid benefits even after they no longer  		receive SSI benefits. In December 1987, there were 15,632 former SSI recipients  		receiving special Medicaid benefits under Section 1619(b).</p>
<p>Thus, there are a number of Medicaid program options through which  		disabled persons who are not eligible for SSI cash assistance can nonetheless  		qualify for Medicaid coverage as "non-cash" recipients. There are a number of  		other relatively minor program provisions which extend Medicaid eligibility to  		certain disabled persons not receiving SSI benefits, but they apply to  		relatively few persons. For example, disabled SSI recipients who lose their  		benefits because they become eligible for SSDI benefits as Adult Disabled  		Children (and their SSDI benefits exceed the SSI benefit standard) retain their  		eligibility for Medicaid benefits despite losing SSI.</p>
<p>A new Medicaid provision also extends limited Medicaid benefits to  		certain disabled persons who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage.  		Under a provision of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 which was  		not subsequently repealed, States are required to pay Medicare Part B premiums,  		deductibles and coinsurance for disabled Medicare enrollees whose incomes are  		at or below the Federal poverty level and whose resources are at or below twice  		the SSI resource standard (in 1989, the SSI resource standard was $2,000 for an  		individual). This provision applies to disabled <b>Medicare</b> enrollees under  		age 65 whose incomes and/or resources are too high to qualify them for Medicaid  		coverage, but who are still living at or below the poverty level. The provision  		is being phased in gradually: effective January 1989, States were required to  		implement "buy-in" coverage for disabled Medicare enrollees with incomes at or  		below 85 percent of poverty. This limit will be gradually raised to 100 percent  		of the poverty level between 1989 and 1992.</p>
<p>In 1989, it is estimated that there were about 3.2 million disabled  		Medicare beneficiaries, of which about 25-30% were already enrolled in the  		Medicaid program. It is difficult to estimate how many of the remaining 2.2  		million disabled Medicare enrollees who are not currently eligible for Medicaid  		qualify for these "buy-in" benefits. Note that these persons are not eligible  		for the full Medicaid benefit package; Medicaid only pays for their Medicare  		Part B premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance.</p>
<h3>8.6 Medicaid Services</h3>
<p>As in Medicaid eligibility, in which there are both mandatory and  		optional groups of Medicaid beneficiaries, there are also both <b>mandatory</b>  		and <b>optional</b> services which States can provide in their Medicaid benefit  		packages. Further, States have considerable flexibility in regard to the  		amount, scope and duration of the Medicaid benefits they elect to provide. For  		example, a State may place limits on the number of inpatient hospital days it  		will cover over a certain period, or a limit on the number of physician visits  		it will pay per beneficiary. However, all services must be equal in amount,  		duration and scope to all beneficiaries within an eligibility group, they must  		be available on a statewide basis, and Medicaid beneficiaries must be allowed  		freedom-of-choice in selecting from whom they obtain Medicaid-funded  		services.</p>
<p>Mandatory services which all States must provide include:</p>
<ul><li>inpatient hospital services;</li>
<li>outpatient hospital services;</li>
<li>rural health clinic services</li>
<li>other laboratory and X-ray services;</li>
<li>skilled nursing facility (SNF) services;</li>
<li>early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment (EPSDT)  		  services for individuals under age 21;</li>
<li>physician services;</li>
<li>home health services for persons requiring skilled nursing care;  		  and</li>
<li>nurse-midwife services (in States where nurse midwives are authorized  		  to practice under State law).</li>
</ul><p>In addition to these mandatory services, States may offer Medicaid  		coverage for a broad array of optional services in their State plans. These  		services include:</p>
<ul><li>podiatrists' services</li>
<li>optometrists' services</li>
<li>chiropractors' services</li>
<li>other practitioner services</li>
<li>private duty nursing</li>
<li>clinic services</li>
<li>dental services</li>
<li>physical therapy</li>
<li>speech, hearing, and language therapies</li>
<li>prescribed drugs</li>
<li>dentures</li>
<li>prosthetic devices</li>
<li>eyeglasses</li>
<li>diagnostic services</li>
<li>screening services</li>
<li>preventive services</li>
<li>rehabilitative services</li>
<li>services for persons age 65 and over in mental institutions</li>
<li>intermediate care facility (ICF) services</li>
<li>intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF-MR)  		  services</li>
<li>inpatient psychiatric services for persons under age 22</li>
<li>Christian Science nurses</li>
<li>Christian Science sanitoria</li>
<li>SNF services for persons under age 21</li>
<li>emergency hospital services</li>
<li>personal care services</li>
<li>transportation services</li>
<li>case management services, and</li>
<li>hospice services</li>
</ul><p>With regard to the amount, duration and scope of both optional and  		mandatory services, States have the option of offering a more restrictive  		benefit package for the medically needy than they offer for the categorically  		needy. Thus, disabled Medicaid beneficiaries who qualify under one of the  		"non-cash" eligibility options may not be entitled to the same set of Medicaid  		services as an SSI cash recipient. Of the 35 States which had medically needy  		programs in 1986, 27 States offered the same benefit package for mandatory  		Medicaid services to the medically needy as they did to the categorically  		needy, and 23 offered the same benefit package for optional services.</p>
<p>Providers who agree to participate in the Medicaid program are required  		to accept Medicaid reimbursements as "payment in full" for the services they  		provide. Unlike Medicare providers, they cannot bill Medicaid recipients for  		additional charges above and beyond the amount they are reimbursed by Medicaid.  		However, States can impose "nominal" copayments for certain Medicaid services,  		as a utilization control measure. In general, copayments cannot exceed $3.00  		per service per month. States cannot impose copayments on services provided to  		children or for pregnancy-related services.</p>
<h3>8.7 Recent Legislative Changes</h3>
<p>The Medicaid program has been subject to considerable legislative change  		during the 1980s, and it is not possible to summarize all of the changes in  		this brief program description. Many of the changes did not affect persons with  		disabling conditions at all. However, some of the changes which did apply to  		the Medicaid disabled population are summarized below:</p>
<p><b>The Section 1619 program</b>. Initially enacted on a demonstration  		basis in 1981, and eventually made permanent in 1987, Section 1619 ensured that  		any disabled person receiving SSI benefits could enter the workforce and not be  		in danger of losing health insurance benefits under Medicaid as long as there  		was no improvement in his or her medical condition.</p>
<p><b>Medicaid Home and Community-Based Care Waiver Program</b>. Enacted in  		1981, the Medicaid waiver program provides alternative home and community-based  		services to aged and disabled persons who might otherwise only be able to  		access Medicaid-funded long term care services by entering an institution.</p>
<p><b>TEFRA Section 134 Option for Disabled Children</b>. Sometimes  		referred to as the "Katie Beckett" option after the disabled child whose case  		initially led to this policy change, this option, enacted in 1982, allows  		States to waive Medicaid deeming rules for certain disabled children living at  		home who would otherwise only be eligible for Medicaid in an institutional  		setting (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section8.5.2">Section 8.5.2</a>).</p>
<p><b>Optional income levels for the aged and disabled</b>. OBRA 1986  		allowed States to establish Medicaid eligibility income levels for the aged and  		disabled that are separate from income levels used in establishing eligibility  		for SSI/SSP benefits. Under this option, income levels for SSI-related  		applicants can be set anywhere up to the Federal poverty level for a  		comparably-sized household.</p>
<p><b>Mandated Medicaid buy-in for disabled Medicare enrollees living below  		the poverty level</b>. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 mandated  		that State Medicaid programs pay for ("buy-in") the Medicare premiums,  		deductibles, and coinsurance for all Medicare disabled enrollees living at or  		below the poverty threshold. This provision is being phased in between 1989 and  		1992.</p>
<p><b>Protection of income and resources of spouses of institutionalized  		Medicaid recipients</b>. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act also provided  		increased protection for the non-institutionalized spouses of Medicaid  		recipients in nursing homes and other institutional settings. Prior to  		enactment of this provision, non-institutionalized spouses could be left  		destitute if all of the couple's income and assets were held in the name of the  		institutionalized spouse.</p>
<p><b>Mandated preadmission screening of mentally ill and mentally retarded  		persons for nursing home placement</b>. OBRA 1987 mandated that all States  		implement nursing home preadmission screening programs to identify nursing home  		applicants with a primary medical diagnosis of mental illness or mental  		retardation. Persons with such a diagnosis, who do not need the level of care  		provided in a nursing home, are to be diverted elsewhere. Current residents of  		nursing homes who are mentally ill or mentally retarded must also be given the  		choice of alternative placement in the community.</p>
<h3>8.8 Program Interactions</h3>
<p><i><b>8.8.1 Medicaid and SSI</b></i></p>
<p>Medicaid eligibility for persons with disabilities is closely tied to  		eligibility for SSI cash assistance, as previously discussed. Except in  		so-called "Section 209(b)" States, disabled persons who receive SSI benefits  		are automatically eligible for Medicaid coverage. In some States, disabled SSI  		beneficiaries are automatically enrolled in Medicaid; in others they must make  		a separate application (see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section8.5">Section 8.5</a>).</p>
<p><i><b>8.8.2 Medicaid and SSDI</b></i></p>
<p>SSDI beneficiaries are not necessarily eligible for Medicaid, but many  		SSDI beneficiaries nonetheless are. Some are eligible because they receive both  		SSDI and SSI. Others only receive SSDI, but qualify for Medicaid coverage as  		"non-cash" recipients under medically needy programs or other Medicaid program  		options.</p>
<p><i><b>8.8.3 Medicaid and Medicare</b></i></p>
<p>Persons who receive both SSDI and SSI benefits as disabled are generally  		eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare coverage (unless they are in the  		two-year waiting period for Medicare). These persons are often referred to as  		"dual enrollees." When persons are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid,  		Medicare is always the first payer; Medicaid covers the premiums, deductibles  		and coinsurance amounts for services covered under both programs (e.g.  		inpatient hospital care). However, the Medicaid benefit package in most States  		is much broader than the Medicare benefit package, and therefore Medicaid is  		often the first and only payer of other covered services, such as nursing home  		care and prescription drugs.</p>
<p><i><b>8.8.4 Coordination with other payment sources</b></i></p>
<p>Medicaid is almost always the payer of last resort. Medicaid applicants  		are required to disclose any insurance coverage or other potential third party  		payment source at the time of their application, and all State Medicaid  		programs are required to have a system for pursuing third party claims. These  		systems may include data exchanges with workers' compensation boards or State  		motor vehicle accident report files. States must also have systems for  		collecting medical support payments from absent parents.</p>
<p><i><b>8.8.5 Medicaid and the Indian Health Service</b></i></p>
<p>An exception to the rule of Medicaid being the payer of last resort  		occurs in the case of Native Americans who receive services through the Indian  		Health Services (IHS), and who are also eligible for Medicaid. In the case of  		services provided in IHS facilities to Medicaid-eligible Native Americans, IHS  		bills Medicaid directly, and Federal matching funds for services provided in  		IHS facilities are reimbursable at a matching rate of 100 percent.</p>
<h3>8.9 Special Issues</h3>
<p>This section discusses Medicaid policy issues which specifically relate  		to the coverage of persons who are categorically eligible as disabled.</p>
<p><i><b>8.9.1 Variations in access to Medicaid coverage across  		States</b></i></p>
<p>The flexibility offered States in designing their own Medicaid  		eligibility and service coverage policies has led to wide variation across  		States in providing access to Medicaid-covered services for low income persons  		with disabilities. Some States have relatively broad coverage of persons with  		disabilities, others relatively restrictive coverage. A disabled person in one  		State may have health insurance coverage under Medicaid, while a disabled  		person in the same financial circumstances may be left without any health  		insurance coverage at all. Some of the factors which lead to variations in  		coverage across States include:</p>
<ul><li>The method by which States elect to extend Medicaid coverage for  		  persons receiving SSI/SSP cash assistance, including the Section 209(b) option  		  to impose more restrictive criteria than are used in SSI;</li>
<li>Variations in benefit standards used for optional State  		  supplementation programs;</li>
<li>Whether a State has elected to have a medically needy program, and,  		  if so, the income and asset levels used in determining Medicaid eligibility for  		  the medically needy;</li>
<li>Only a few States have elected to use a higher income level in  		  determining Medicaid eligibility for SSI-related recipients, as authorized in  		  OBRA 1986, than is used in determining eligibility for SSI/SSP; and</li>
<li>States vary in the degree to which they have used Medicaid home and  		  community-based care waivers and the 1982 TEFRA option to extend Medicaid  		  eligibility to disabled persons in the community who would otherwise only be  		  able to access Medicaid coverage through institutionalization.</li>
</ul><p>Although State flexibility in Medicaid eligibility and service coverage  		policy has always been a key component of the Medicaid program, there is also  		concern about inequities across States in the degree to which low-income  		persons are provided health insurance coverage under Medicaid. To address  		access inequities, there are those who believe that the Federal government  		should mandate more uniform Medicaid eligibility policies nationwide.</p>
<p><i><b>8.9.2 Bias Towards Institutional Coverage</b></i></p>
<p>The Medicaid program has long been criticized for having an inherent  		bias towards institutional coverage for elderly and disabled persons with long  		term care needs. In most States, Medicaid-eligible persons with severe  		disabilities, who may require continuous care and supervision, can more easily  		access the services they need in institutional settings, such as nursing homes  		and ICFs-MR, than in community-based settings. A number of Medicaid policy  		changes in recent years have attempted to counter this bias in Medicaid service  		coverage policy, such as the 1982 TEFRA option for disabled children, and the  		Section 2176 Medicaid home and community-based waiver program. However,  		coverage of non-medical home and community-based services for persons with long  		term care needs is still highly restricted under Medicaid. There is  		considerable momentum to provide States the option of coveraging a broad array  		of non-institutional home and community-based services under Medicaid without  		restrictions. At the same time, there is concern about the fiscal impact this  		policy change would have on Medicaid program expenditures, given that most  		disabled persons with long-term care needs do not live in institutional  		settings.</p>
<p><i><b>8.9.3 Exclusion of Long-Term Care Coverage for Disabled Persons  		with Chronic Mental Illness</b></i></p>
<p>Although Medicaid provides institutional long term care coverage for all  		other persons under age 65 with severe disabilities, the program generally  		excludes institutional coverage for disabled persons with chronic mental  		illness. While the enactment of the ICF-MR (Intermediate Care Facility for the  		Mentally Retarded) benefit in 1971 allowed States to receive Federal Financial  		Participation (FFP) under Medicaid for the costs of operating their public  		institutions for the mentally retarded (provided the institutions met Federal  		certification standards), a similar option has never been enacted to include  		public institutions for the mentally ill in the Medicaid program. Thus, State  		mental hospitals and other residential facilities which serve the chronically  		mentally ill are generally not financed by the Medicaid program. In fact, if  		any Medicaid-certified facility, such as a nursing home, is found to serve a  		population in which more than 50% of the residents have a primary diagnosis of  		mental illness, the facility is classified as an Institution for Mental  		Diseases (IMD) and loses eligibility for Medicaid reimbursement.</p>
<p>Under the provisions of OBRA 1987, States are also required to establish  		preadmission screening programs designed to prevent the inappropriate placement  		of persons with mental illness in nursing homes. Under this law, States are  		also required to offer mentally ill persons currently in nursing homes the  		opportunity to live in an alternative residential environment more appropriate  		to their needs.</p>
<p><i><b>8.9.4 Medicaid and AIDS</b></i></p>
<p>Medicaid is an important source of health insurance coverage for persons  		with AIDS. Both the total health care costs of treating persons with AIDS, and  		the percentage of those costs paid by Medicaid are difficult to estimate. The  		office of the Actuary at HCFA estimates that Medicaid will pay for about half  		of all health costs for AIDS patients in 1991. However, there are indications  		that many private insurers are implementing underwriting policies to limit  		their exposure to the costs of treating persons with AIDS by screening out  		persons with AIDS or persons infected with the AIDS virus at the time of  		application for health insurance coverage and by imposing restrictions on  		coverage of AIDS-related cases. It is also important to remember that persons  		with AIDS who become disabled and thereby eligible for Social Security  		disability insurance are not eligible for Medicare coverage until two years  		after their initial receipt of disability benefits. Consequently, many persons  		with AIDS who become disabled and unable to work are left without any health  		insurance coverage whatsoever, and may qualify for Medicaid after spending down  		their available income and assets.</p>
<p>AIDS patients can qualify for Medicaid coverage in one of three ways.  		First, some persons who develop AIDS, particularly IV drug-users, may already  		be receiving cash assistance through SSI or AFDC prior to contracting AIDS, and  		are therefore already eligible for Medicaid. Second, some AIDS victims may  		become impoverished as a result of their disease, and qualify for SSI cash  		assistance after their diagnosis. Third, other persons with AIDS may continue  		to be able to work, or may continue to have income which disqualifies them for  		SSI benefits, but have high medical expenses which cause them to become  		eligible for Medicaid under the medically needy "spend down" provisions.</p>
<p>Under a special ruling, AIDS victims who apply for SSI benefits can  		begin to receive benefits, and therefore Medicaid, under a "presumptive  		eligibility" process which expedites their eligibility for benefits. Persons  		with a medically confirmed diagnosis of AIDS can automatically begin receiving  		SSI and Medicaid under this process while the formal determination of their  		disabled status is being made. This special provision does not apply to persons  		with AIDS-related complex (ARC) who do not have the more narrowly defined  		diagnosis of AIDS.</p>
<p>It is recognized that the costs of treating persons with AIDS will not  		affect all State Medicaid programs equally. The two States with by far the  		largest numbers of persons with AIDS are California and New York. These States  		are not only grappling with the problem of covering the potential costs of  		caring for AIDS patients in their Medicaid populations, but also the most  		appropriate service approaches to providing care. Many AIDS patients are being  		inappropriately treated in inpatient hospital settings for extended periods of  		time. Alternative service approaches, such as specialized nursing homes,  		hospice programs, and home and community-based waiver programs, are currently  		under development in several States.</p>
<h3>8.10 Program Data</h3>
<p><b><i>8.10.1 Current Medicaid disabled recipients, expenditures, and  		costs per recipient</i></b></p>
<p>In 1989, there were approximately 3,471,000 persons eligible for  		Medicaid on the basis of disability who received at least one Medicaid-funded  		service.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note26">26</a></font></sup> Another  		95,000 Medicaid recipients were eligible on the basis of blindness. Together,  		these two populations accounted for about 14 percent of the 24.7 million  		Medicaid recipients in 1989.</p>
<p>In terms of expenditures, the Medicaid disabled population account for a  		much larger share of program spending. In 1987, Medicaid payments made for  		services provided to the disabled totalled $16.5 billion, about 36 percent of  		the $45.1 billion in total Medicaid program expenditures for that year. Of this  		total, the Federal government paid about $9.2 billion (56 percent), while the  		State share of Medicaid costs for the disabled totalled $7.3 billion (44  		percent).</p>
<p>In 1987, the average annual cost per Medicaid disabled recipient was  		$4,986, the highest of any major eligibility group in Medicaid.</p>
<p><b><i>8.10.2 Distribution of Medicaid expenditures for the  		disabled</i></b></p>
<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit8-3">Exhibit 8-3</a> presents the distribution of  		Medicaid expenditures for the disabled in FY 1987. Almost half (46.3%) of all  		Medicaid spending for the disabled was for institutional long term care  		services, either in ICF-MR certified facilities or in nursing homes. ICF-MR  		care alone accounted for 31.5 percent of total Medicaid spending for the  		disabled, although the 149,000 recipients of ICF-MR care represented only about  		4.5 percent of the entire Medicaid disabled population. In 1987, the average  		annual cost per recipient of ICF-MR care was $37,630. Another 229,000 disabled  		Medicaid recipients received care in ICF-certified and SNF-certified facilities  		in 1987, at a cost of about $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>Disabled persons on Medicaid are high users of prescription drugs. In  		1987, about 78% of all Medicaid disabled recipients had at least one claim for  		prescription drugs, and among users, the average annual cost of prescription  		drug use per disabled recipient was $449.</p>

<p><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit8-5">Exhibit 8-5</a> presents a distribution of the  		Medicaid disabled population by institutional status and cash assistance status  		in FY 1987. Almost three-fourths of the Medicaid disabled population are SSI  		cash recipients who do not receive institutional long term care in ICFs-MR,  		SNFs, or ICFs. About 12 percent of the population are institutionalized for at  		least part of the year.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note27">27</a></font></sup> The number of institutionalized recipients  		declined between 1980 and 1987.</p>
<p>About 15 percent of the Medicaid disabled are non-institutionalized  		non-cash recipients, who are eligible for Medicaid under one of the eligibility  		options discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section8.5">Section 8.5</a> for persons not  		receiving SSI cash assistance. Trends in the number of non-institutionalized  		non-cash recipients are an important indicator of the degree to which Medicaid  		is providing health insurance coverage for low-income disabled persons who for  		one reason or another, do not receive SSI benefits, but who nonetheless require  		medical assistance. As shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit8-5">Exhibit 8-5</a>, the  		number of non-institutionalized non-cash recipients increased from about  		345,000 in 1980 to about 475,000 in 1987, an average ACRG of 4.6 percent.</p>
<p><b><i>8.10.5 Age and Sex Characteristics of Medicaid Disabled  		Recipients</i></b></p>
<p>Since most Medicaid disabled recipients are also SSI disabled  		recipients, the age and sex characteristics of the two populations are similar  		(see <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section3.10.3">Section 3.10.3</a>). Approximately 10% of the  		Medicaid disabled population are SSI children under the age of 18. Very few  		disabled children not receiving SSI cash assistance participate in the Medicaid  		program. About 18 percent of the Medicaid disabled population is over the age  		of 65. Disabled recipients over age 65 are persons who were eligible for  		Medicaid prior to age 65, and who continue to be classified as Medicaid  		"disabled" instead of "aged" after passing their 65th birthday. Almost all of  		these persons are non-institutionalized SSI cash recipients.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#SSI">Chapter 3</a>, about half of all SSI  		disabled recipients (and therefore Medicaid disabled recipients) under the age  		of 65 are persons with a primary diagnosis of mental retardation or mental  		illness. About 58% of the Medicaid disabled are women, and about 34% are  		black.</p>
<p>A recent study of the Medicaid disabled "cash" population (only those  		receiving SSI benefits) showed that younger disabled persons on Medicaid had  		higher average expenditures than older recipients, primarily because older  		recipients were more likely to have work histories and be also covered by  		Medicare, which is always the first payer.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>

<p>As discussed in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section8.5">Section 8.5</a>, States have  		various options as to how to treat SSI recipients in determining eligibility  		for Medicaid. Analyses indicate if States elect either of the two more  		restrictive options (requiring disabled SSI recipients to file a separate  		application for Medicaid or imposing more restrictive eligibility criteria  		under the Section 209(b) option), enrollment of disabled SSI recipients on  		Medicaid is definitively reduced. Compared to States which automatically extend  		Medicaid eligibility to SSI recipients without requiring a separate  		application, States which require a separate application have about 10% fewer  		SSI cash recipients on Medicaid, and States which elect the Section 209(b)  		option have, on average, about 35% fewer SSI cash recipients on  		Medicaid.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="VAHealth" id="VAHealth">CHAPTER 9. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HEALTH  		SERVICES PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<h3>9.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates a nationwide health  		care system, the goal of which is to provide quality medical care on a timely  		basis to all eligible veterans. The system includes 172 hospital centers, 119  		nursing homes, 233 outpatient clinics, and 26 domiciliary care facilities.</p>
<h3>9.2 Authorization, History, and Funding</h3>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs was established as a separate Federal  		agency in 1930, consolidating benefits and services administered by three  		separate agencies prior to that time. The VA hospital system has grown from 54  		hospitals in 1930 to its current network of 172 medical centers.</p>
<p>Funding allocations for medical care programs are made through annual  		direct appropriations to the VA. In 1988, medical care programs administered by  		the VA totalled $10.8 billion. This includes the cost of direct medical  		services, the construction and modernization of facilities, as well as medical  		research and training programs.</p>
<h3>9.3 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>Medical care in the VA health system is administered by the Veterans  		Health Services and Research Administration. Most medical services provided by  		the VA are provided in facilities directly owned and operated by the VA,  		although the VA also contracts for certain types of services, such as community  		nursing home care. The VA also provides cost sharing for services provided in  		State-operated hospitals, nursing homes, and domiciliary care facilities which  		serve eligible veterans. The VA directly employs over 200,000 health service  		personnel in the management and delivery of its health services programs.</p>
<h3>9.4 Eligibility</h3>
<p>Public Law 99-272, enacted in 1986, established three eligibility groups  		among veterans for health care services (Category A, B and C). VA hospitals are  		required to provide care to veterans in Category A and can provide care to  		veterans in categories B and C on a space-available basis.</p>
<p>A Category A veteran is any person who meets one or more of the  		following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>is rated as "ser-vice-connected;"</li>
<li>is retired from active duty for a disability incurred or aggravated  		  while in military service;</li>
<li>is in receipt of a VA pension;</li>
<li>is eligible for Medicaid;</li>
<li>is a former POW;</li>
<li>is in need of care for a condition that is possibly related to  		  exposure to dioxin or other toxic substance;</li>
<li>is in need of care for a condition possibly related to exposure to  		  radiation from nuclear tests or in the American occupation of Japan; or</li>
<li>has an income below $16,466 with no dependents, or $19,759 with one  		  dependent (with $1,055 added for each additional dependent).</li>
</ul><p>Persons in Category B are veterans who are not service-connected and  		have incomes above $16,466 but below $21,954 (higher limits are applied to  		veterans with dependents). Medical care for veterans with higher incomes  		(Category C) is available as long as resources permit, and requires a copayment  		on the part of the veteran.</p>
<p>The same law eliminated the previous eligibility of veterans aged 65 and  		over to receive medical care on the basis of age alone. In FY 1987, 95% of the  		patients served by the VA system were in Category A, 2.5% were in Category B,  		and 2.5% were in Category C.</p>
<h3>9.5 Services Provided</h3>
<p>The VA provides a complete range of surgical, medical, rehabilitative  		and long term care services to eligible veterans. The system includes about  		76,000 hospital beds, including 22,000 psychiatric beds, as well as  		approximately 12,000 nursing home beds. Services provided by the VA include  		many specialized services required by veterans with disabilities, including  		rehabilitative services, special programs for veterans with alcohol and drug  		dependence a spinal cord injury service, programs for post-traumatic stress  		problems, disorder, and a prosthetic and sensory aids services.</p>
<h3>9.6 Program Interactions</h3>
<p>The VA is first payer for all services provided to veterans who qualify  		under Category A for VA medical services. For veterans who are non-service  		connected (Categories B and C), VA is generally the secondary payer and  		attempts are made to recover the cost of care provided to veterans in  		Categories B and C with third party health insurance. In 1987, the VA collected  		about $24 million for medical care provided to health-insured  		nonservice-connected veterans.</p>
<h3>9.7 Program Data</h3>
<p>In FY 1987, VA health care system treated about 1.4 million veterans in  		its hospital care system, and had an average daily census of about 56,000  		patients. The system served an average daily census of about 17,000 patients in  		its nursing home and domiciliary care facilities, and supported an additional  		daily census of about 25,000 in community and State-operated nursing homes and  		domiciliary care facilities. In total, about 2.9 million recipients received  		medical care services through the VA system in 1987.</p>
<p>Total outlays for medical programs operated by the VA have increased  		from $6.5 billion in 1980 to $10.8 billion in 1988. Of course, not all of these  		expenditures are for veterans with disabilities, and although veterans with  		disabilities comprise a significant portion of the VA caseload, it is not  		possible to disaggregate services and expenditures in the VA system to disabled  		and nondisabled populations.</p>
<h2><a name="CHAMPUS" id="CHAMPUS">CHAPTER 10. CHAMPUS PROGRAM FOR THE  		HANDICAPPED</a></h2>
<h3>10.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services  		(CHAMPUS) provides health insurance coverage for eligible dependents of active  		service personnel. The CHAMPUS Program for the Handicapped (PFTH) provides  		specialized care for disabled dependents of active-duty military personnel who  		cannot get required care from public institutions or agencies.</p>
<h3>10.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>PFTH is authorized under the Military Medical Benefits Act Amendments of  		1966 (P.L. 89-614). The program was established by Congress to provide  		financial assistance to active-duty military personnel's handicapped  		dependents, who because of residency laws, are excluded from public programs  		and institutions for the handicapped. Funding for this 100% Federally funded  		program in FY 1987 was $4,681,000.</p>
<h3>10.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>The definition of disability used for PFTH is based on the strength and  		duration of a physical or mental handicap. The physical handicap must be of  		such severity as to preclude the individual from performing basic activities of  		daily living at a level expected of unimpaired individuals of the same age  		group and must be expected to result in death or to have lasted or be expected  		to last for at least 12 months. For a mental handicap, the applicant must be  		medically determined to be moderately or severely retarded.</p>
<h3>10.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>The program is administered by the Department of Defense, Office of  		Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS)  		through its fiscal intermediaries. Active duty members who wish to apply for  		benefits under the CHAMPUS Program for the Handicapped must submit a plan of  		management of the handicapping condition, including estimated costs, to the  		CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary for approval.</p>
<h3>10.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>Spouses and children of active duty military personnel are eligible to  		receive specialized institutional care, training, or rehabilitation if  		moderately or severely mentally retarded or seriously physically handicapped.  		The program will pay for care only if the individual is ineligible for other  		publicly financed programs or if the available programs are unable to meet the  		individual's needs.</p>
<h3>10.6 Services/Benefits Provided</h3>
<p>Services provided include diagnosis; inpatient, outpatient, and home  		treatment; training, rehabilitation and special education; institutional care;  		payment for nutrient solutions required for special feeding at home; and the  		purchase and maintenance of durable equipment. The family pays a set amount of  		the cost of care each month based on the active-duty member's pay level. The  		cost-share amount ranges from $25 to $250 a month and does not increase with  		the number of dependents covered by the program. Beneficiaries ate eligible for  		up to $1,000 a month of coverage beyond the costs covered by the family's share  		for services and supplies provided under the program.</p>
<h3>10.7 Program Interactions</h3>
<p>This program is designed to finance services as a last resort if a  		disabled individual is ineligible for services provided by public institutions  		and agencies.</p>
<h3>10.8 Program Data</h3>
<p>In FY 1987, 2,508 individuals were assisted by the program.</p>
<h2><a name="SSBG" id="SSBG">CHAPTER 11. SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT</a></h2>
<h3>11.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is the largest source of Federal  		funds for social services. The statute specifies five service goals for the  		SSBG program: 1) preventing, reducing or eliminating dependency; 2) achieving  		or maintaining self-sufficiency or economic self-support; 3) preventing or  		remedying child and adult abuse and neglect; 4) preventing or reducing  		inappropriate institutional care; and 5) securing admission or referral for  		institutional care when other types of care are not appropriate. Each State  		determines the types of services to be provided and the individuals to be  		served under the program. There is considerable variation across States with  		regard to how SSBG funds are targeted, and although the program has been a  		major source of financing for supportive services to persons with disabilities,  		actual data on the extent to which the program serves persons with disabilities  		are not available.</p>
<h3>11.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>Authorization for the Social Services Block Grant is contained in Title  		XX of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  		Act of 1981. The block grant consolidated Federal assistance to States for  		social services, child day care services and training; and increased State  		flexibility in the use of the funds. Federal appropriations for the SSBG rose  		between 1982 and 1984 but have remained essentially constant from FY 1984 to FY  		1989 at $2.7 billion. The program is 100% Federally funded. Because of the  		flexibility the block grant has allowed the States, it is not possible to  		determine what proportion of total funds are expended for services to the  		disabled.</p>
<p>The territories are allocated funds based on the initial allocations  		made in FY 1981 when the program was established. For the remaining States,  		allocations are made in proportion to State population. Allocations for FY 1989  		ranged from $301 million in California and $198 million in New York State to  		$5.6 million in the State of Wyoming.</p>
<h3>11.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>There is no Federal statutory definition of disability in the SSBG  		program, and States are given complete discretion in determining the programs  		that will be supported with SSBG funds. State programs that serve persons with  		disabilities with SSBG funds can set their own criteria for determining  		disability.</p>
<h3>11.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>The Social Services Block Grant Program is administered by the  		Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Development Services.  		Block grant funds are awarded primarily to State and territorial departments of  		social services, who then provide services directly through local offices  		and/or through contracts with private providers. In order to qualify for an  		allotment under the SSBG program, States must submit pre-expenditure reports  		that meet Federal requirements.</p>
<h3>11.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>There are no Federal eligibility requirements for receipt of services  		under the Social Services Block Grant program. States may establish their own  		eligibility rules. The Office of Human Development Services reports that of the  		55 States and territories reporting in 1986, at least 52 States and territories  		reported use of AFDC, SSI and non-income related eligibility groups for SSBG  		supported services. Ten States reported use of special groups including the  		disabled to define eligibility categories.</p>
<h3>11.6 Services/Benefits Provided</h3>
<p>Program funds may be used for the planning, administration or evaluation  		of social service programs as well as reimbursement for direct services.  		Services that benefit persons with disabilities include but are not limited to  		protective services, services for children and adults in foster care, services  		related to the management and maintenance of the home, day care services for  		adults, transportation services, employment services, information, referral and  		counseling services, the preparation and delivery of meals and health support  		services. States have broad discretion to define the social services they  		support under their block grant programs, provided they are directed at the  		program's five major goals. Many States provide a broad range of services to  		many target populations while others narrowly define their target population  		and scope of services. For example, in FY 1987 California utilized their SSBG  		funds to support home-based services for all of their program's target  		populations. The same year Montana earmarked all their SSBG funds for services  		to their developmentally disabled population. Out of 54 States and territories  		reporting to Human Development Services in 1986, 31 stated that they used some  		portion of their SSBG funds to support services targeted to persons with  		disabilities. A study of State funding of services to persons with  		developmental disabilities reported that in FY 1986, States spent $293 million  		in SSBG funds for services to the developmentally disabled.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>11.7 Program Data</h3>
<p>There is very limited information available on the use of SSBG funds by  		States. Presently, States are only required to report information about the  		types of activities they plan to fund and the characteristics of the persons  		served. Under the Family Support Act of 1988, reporting requirements were  		strengthened, and States will be required to submit annual reports containing  		detailed information on services funded and individuals served.</p>

<h3>12.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The mission of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities is to  		assist States in assuring that persons with developmental disabilities are  		given opportunities to achieve their maximum potential through increased  		independence, productivity and integration into the community. The  		administration sponsors four grant programs that support planning and  		coordination of services, and the provision of an array of direct services, as  		well as protection and advocacy systems in each State to protect the legal and  		human rights of persons with developmental disabilities. The four programs are  		the Basic State Grant Program, the Protection and Advocacy Program, the  		University Affiliated Programs and Projects of National Significance.</p>
<h3>12.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>The Administration on Developmental Disabilities' Programs are  		authorized under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights  		Act Amendments of 1987 (Public Law 100-146) parts A-E. The Act evolved from the  		Mental Retardation Facilities Construction Act of 1963 and has been revised  		periodically to the current act. In FY 1989, approximately $60 million was  		awarded to States under the Basic State Grant Program to better plan and  		coordinate services for persons with developmental disabilities with an  		emphasis on case management, child development, community living and employment  		related services. Also in FY 1989, the Protection and Advocacy Program  		allocated $19.8 million to States to protect the rights of persons with  		developmental disabilities through the pursuit of legal and administrative  		remedies. $12.6 million was provided to support the University Affiliated  		Programs and almost $3 million was allocated in support of research and  		demonstration Projects of National Significance to increase the independence,  		productivity and integration into the community of persons with developmental  		disabilities.</p>
<p>The four Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) grant  		programs have different State matching fund requirements. For the Basic State  		Grants, the Federal share can be no greater than 75% of the project costs,  		except in rural or urban poverty areas where the Federal share will not exceed  		90%. The Protection and Advocacy Program is 100% Federally funded as are the  		University Affiliated Programs and the Projects of National Significance.</p>
<p>Grant funding for the two of the State grant programs is allocated among  		the States and territories on the basis of population, need for services, and  		financial need of the individual States and territories. Grant awards for these  		ADD grant programs have been allocated as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Basic State Grants: Federal funding of the Basic State grant program  			 in FY 1989 totalled just under $60 million. Annual funding levels for FY 1980  			 through FY 1989 are presented in <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit12-1">Exhibit 12-1</a>.  			 Grants ranged from $4 million in California to $160,000 in the U.S.  			 territories. The minimum allotment for the program when the appropriation  			 exceeds $47 million is $300,000 per State and $160,000 per territory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protection and Advocacy Grants: In FY 1986, funding totaled $9  			 million. State allotments ranged from $700,000 in California, and $150,000 in  			 Missouri, to $67,000 in the U.S. territories.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><a name="section12.3" id="section12.3">12.3 Definition of  		Disability</a></h3>
<p>The Administration on Developmental Disabilities estimates that as of  		1989, 3.9 million people in the United States had developmental disabilities.  		The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of  		1987 defines developmental disability as:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A severe, chronic disability of a person which is attributable to a  		  mental and/or physical impairment; is manifested before the person attains age  		  22, is likely to continue indefinitely; reflects the person's need for a  		  combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary or generic care,  		  treatment or other services which are of a lifelong or extended duration and  		  are individually planned and coordinated; and results in substantial functional  		  limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activities:  		  (1) self care; (2) receptive and expressive language; (3) learning; (4)  		  mobility; (5) self-direction; (6) capacity for independent  		  living.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>12.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>At the Federal level, the programs are administered by the U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Development Services.  		In order to receive funding through the State grant programs, States must  		establish a Protection and Advocacy System for persons with developmental  		disabilities. Currently Protection and Advocacy Systems operate in every State.  		Most of the systems are operated by private non-profit organizations. Several  		systems are operated by State agencies such as Governors' Commissions on Human  		Resources and State Civil Rights Commissions. The Protection and Advocacy  		System in each State must have the authority to pursue legal, administrative  		and other remedies. For example, the system must have the authority to  		investigate incidents of abuse and neglect and have access to client records.  		The system must be independent from any agency which provides these  		services.</p>
<p>The University Affiliated Program grants are awarded to and administered  		by universities and satellite centers. The Projects of National Significance  		are awarded to and administered by State and local governments, universities  		and non-profit organizations.</p>
<h3>12.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>Direct service provision to persons with developmental disabilities is  		not a priority for ADD grant programs; however some services are funded out of  		the activities of the grants. In cases where ADD grant monies are being used in  		direct service provision, there are no Federally mandated income or functional  		eligibility requirements for clients served. However, Federal guidelines define  		the population to be served under ADD programs as persons meeting the  		definition of developmental disabilities contained in the DD Act of 1987 (see  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#section12.3">Section 12.3</a>).</p>
<h3>12.6 Services/Benefits Provided</h3>
<p>The Administration on Developmental Disabilities' grant programs support  		a variety of activities aimed at enhancing the independence and protecting the  		rights of persons with developmental disabilities. The Basic State Grant  		Program funds are used to support planning and administrative costs as well as  		the delivery of services. The main focus of the program is stimulating new  		programs which are responsive to the needs of developmentally disabled persons.  		Under the program, State DD Councils receive monies to better plan and  		coordinate services for persons with developmental disabilities with priority  		on strengthening case management, child development, community living, and  		employment related services. States are required to spend at least 65% of their  		grant for service activities within certain priority areas specified by ADD for  		each grant cycle. Beginning in 1986, States were required to include employment  		activities as a funding priority.</p>
<p>The Protection and Advocacy Program grants are used to assist people  		with developmental disabilities in obtaining appropriate education, employment,  		guardianship, transportation, and housing; resolving situations that are  		abusive and neglectful; and removing architectural barriers. Protection and  		Advocacy System staff offer referrals to appropriate agencies, counseling,  		negotiation, dispute mediation, and legal representation.</p>
<p>The University Affiliated Program grants support forty-seven university  		programs in forty-one States and the District of Columbia. The funding is used  		to support administrative and operating expenses related to the provision of  		services to the ADD community and training for personnel needed to serve people  		with developmental disabilities. Direct services to individuals include initial  		diagnosis and evaluation, and community-based services such as supportive  		housing and vocational training.</p>
<p>Projects of National Significance grants have supported demonstrations,  		research and evaluation projects which have expanded or otherwise improved  		opportunities for persons with developmental disabilities. Each year, ADD  		announces priorities for these projects. In FY 1988, 25 grants were awarded in  		the following priority areas: family support services, data collection  		activities, HIV/AIDS, minority populations, and elderly persons with  		developmental disabilities.</p>
<h3>12.7 Program Data</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>While direct services are not a priority for use of Basic State  			 Grants, ADD reports that approximately 57,414 persons were served in FY 1986.  			 Services were in the areas of alternative community living arrangements, job  			 training, health care and education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FY 1987 the Protection and Advocacy Program served an estimated  			 70,210 persons with needs in education, housing, financial entitlement, abuse,  			 neglect and exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An estimated 57,000 individuals with developmental disabilities and  			 their families receive direct services each year from the University Affiliated  			 Programs. In addition, approximately 250,000 professionals, paraprofessionals,  			 parents and volunteers receive training in these programs each year.</p>

<h3>13.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The objectives of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) block grant  		program, funded under the Public Health Service (PHS), are to enable States to  		maintain and strengthen their leadership in planning, promoting, coordinating  		and evaluating health care for mothers and children and in providing health  		services for mothers and children who do not have access to adequate health  		care. Until 1981, the Public Health Service provided discretionary funding for  		services to disabled children under separate categorical funding of the  		Services for Crippled Children (CCS) program. Under OBRA 1981, funding for the  		CCS program was folded into the overall Maternal and Child Health Block Grant,  		so that disabled children are no longer identified as a separate categorical  		population. However, most States continue to use a substantial portion of their  		MCH block grant funds to support services for disabled children, now generally  		referred to as Programs for Children with Special Health Care Needs  		(CSHCN).</p>
<h3>13.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>The Maternal and Child Health block grant is authorized under Title V of  		the Social Security Act. The establishment of the block grant dates back to the  		Maternity and Infant Act of 1921. The current grant program was formed by the  		Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 which consolidated six programs  		authorized under Title V into a single block grant authority (the six programs  		were: the State grants-in-aid program for maternal and child health and  		crippled children's services, the SSI Disabled Children's program, and grant  		support for the prevention of lead-based paint poisoning, sudden infant death  		syndrome, hemophilia treatment centers, an adolescent pregnancy program and a  		genetic screening program). State are required to match $3 of direct or in kind  		expenditures for every $4 of Federal aid. Federal appropriations for the  		program in FY 1989 were $554.3 million, up 5% from FY 1988 appropriations of  		$526.6 million.</p>
<p>Of the allocation for the MCH grant, 15% is retained by the Department  		of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to fund research, training, special  		projects, genetic services and hemophilia projects conducted by public and  		private organizations. These are called Special Projects of Regional and  		National Significance (SPRANS grants). The remaining funds are allocated to the  		States and territories based on the share of funds received historically under  		related programs. If appropriations exceed the FY 1983 level, additional funds  		are allocated among the States according to proportion of persons under 21  		living in poverty. In FY 1986 State allocations ranged from $37 million in  		California and $31 million in New York State to $16 million in Florida and  		$858,000 in Alaska.</p>
<h3>13.3 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>The program is administered by the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health  		in the Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Health  		Resources and Services Administration. The Bureau of Maternal and Child Health  		(BCMH) requires each State to submit a State needs assessment. The assessment  		must include information on the types of services to be provided, the types of  		individuals to be served and the type of data the State intends to collect on  		the programs. The State must assure the Secretary that it will use the majority  		of its Title V allotment for services to mothers and children. The State agency  		that administers the program must coordinate its activities with the State's  		Medicaid program and other Federal grant programs (e.g. WIC, education, health  		and developmental disabilities services). States are required to submit annual  		reports to DHHS on programs funded under the Maternal and Child Health block  		grant. Grantees are primarily State health departments who then award  		subcontracts to local or regional health departments, migrant and community  		health centers or private providers.</p>
<h3>13.4 Eligibility</h3>
<p>Although the grant targets low income women and children, there are no  		Federal eligibility requirements that woman and children receiving services  		under the grant must meet. States have the authority to set precise eligibility  		requirements for the receipt of services under the block grant. However, the  		MCH block grant prohibits States from charging fees to low-income mothers and  		children and requires that when fees are charged they reflect the income,  		resources, and family size of the beneficiary. A number of States have sliding  		fee scales for beneficiaries.</p>
<p>There are no Federal criteria for defining children with special health  		care needs who are eligible for assistance under the program. The population  		served by CSHCN programs has changed considerably over time. The CCS programs  		primarily served children with crippling conditions such as polio and cerebral  		palsy, often in State-fun clinics and tertiary care centers. Presently,  		however, CSHCN programs have expanded to serve children with a wide range of  		chronic health conditions.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>13.5 Services/Benefits Provided</h3>
<p>In most States, the CSHCN program plays a significant role in the care  		of chronically ill children. Services offered by States are diverse and  		extensive. Most State spend program funds on screening and treatment of  		handicapping conditions. They also fund a variety of ongoing support services,  		including case management and counseling. A few operate State-owned hospitals  		for handicapped children. State CSHN services are typically provided through  		State health agencies and physicians on a fee-for-service basis.</p>
<p>CSHCN programs are strongly clinic-based programs in many States,  		actually providing some or all of the covered services directly, rather than  		simply serving as a payer of services provided through other programs. However,  		as other sources of financing services for disabled children have grown,  		particularly under Medicaid, there is a general trend in CSHCN programs towards  		an emphasis on the development of case management systems which identify,  		assess and assist families with disabled children in accessing requisite  		medical and support services through other programs.</p>
<h3>13.6 Program Data</h3>
<p>According to survey data collected by the Public Health Foundation,  		States used approximately $98.5 million of the $496.8 million (20%) of their  		MCH block grant funds on Programs for Children with Special Health Care Needs.  		However, States also spent an addition $408.9 million of their own State funds  		on CSHCN programs in the same year. <a href="../daltcp/reports/task2es.htm#exhibit3-1">Exhibit 3-1</a>  		presents trends in Federal funding of the overall Maternal and Child Health  		block grant program from 1980 onward.</p>

<h3>14.1 Overview and Purpose</h3>
<p>The Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services Block Grant provides  		funding to States for maintaining and expanding programs for the prevention and  		treatment of alcohol abuse, drug abuse and mental health disorders.</p>
<h3>14.2 Authorization, History and Funding</h3>
<p>The block grant is authorized under the Public Health Service Act, Title  		XIX, Part B. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 combined four  		separate grant programs authorized under the Community Mental Health Centers  		Act, the Mental Health Systems Act, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and  		Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act and the Drug Abuse  		Prevention and Treatment Act into the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health  		Services Block Grant.</p>
<p>FY 1988 appropriations for the 100% Federally funded program totalled  		$487 million. The appropriation is allocated among the States in proportion to  		population for 50% of the funds and the other 50% is allocated in proportion to  		population weighted by each State's average per capita income. FY 1988 awards  		to States ranged from $48 million in California and $40 million in New York  		State to $758,000 in Wyoming.</p>
<h3>14.3 Definition of Disability</h3>
<p>Block grant funds are meant to benefit persons with chronic mental  		illness, including severely mentally disturbed children, adolescents, and  		elderly clients and those with severe drug dependency problems.</p>
<h3>14.4 Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>The program is administered by the Department of Health and Human  		Services, Public Health Service, Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health  		Administration (ADAMHA). ADAMHA requires each grantee to submit an annual  		report on program activities. Participating States are also required to develop  		a comprehensive State plan to serve persons with chronic mental illness.  		Grantees are primarily State health, mental health and social services  		departments. These State agencies may contract for services with local  		substance abuse and mental health programs.</p>
<h3>14.5 Eligibility</h3>
<p>As is true with the other block grant programs that benefit the disabled  		population, States have discretion over who is served under the program. There  		are no Federal requirements that certain income or functional eligibility  		criteria be used in programs supported by ADAMHA block grant funds. However,  		services funded with the block grant are to be targeted to individuals with  		chronic mental illness, severely mentally disturbed children and adolescents,  		mentally ill elderly individuals and other identifiable populations which are  		underserved.</p>
<h3>14.6 Services/Benefits Provided</h3>
<p>Block grant funds may be used to support community mental health centers  		and the provision of services to the previously specified target populations.  		Spending is at the discretion of the States except that the amount allotted for  		mental health must be used to support community mental health centers. In  		addition, of the amount allotted for substance abuse, not less than 35% must be  		used for alcohol activities, not less than 35% for drug abuse activities and  		not less than 20% for prevention and early intervention activities. Beginning  		in 1985, States were required to set aside monies for new or expanded alcohol  		and drug abuse services to women, and new comprehensive community mental health  		services for the underserved with a special emphasis on severely disturbed  		children. Not more than 10% of the funding can be used to administer the grant  		funds.</p>
<h3>14.7 Special Issues</h3>
<p>In a survey of the States conducted by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and  		Mental Health Administration in 1986, many States reported an inability to  		serve the handicapped population. California, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New  		Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin all identified a need to develop and expand  		services to substance abusers with physical or mental handicaps.</p>

<p>Child welfare services are aimed at protecting and promoting the well  		being of all children including handicapped, homeless, dependent or neglected  		children. The Department of Health and Human Services has several programs  		offering support for child welfare services. The four primary sources of  		funding for child welfare services are Title IV-B Child Welfare Services, the  		Title IV-E Foster Care program, the Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program, and  		the Title XX Social Services Block Grant program.

<h3>15.1 Title IV-B Child Welfare Services</h3>
<p><b><i>15.1.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The Title IV-B Child Welfare Services program provides discretionary  		funds to designated State agencies to provide child welfare services. Services  		are provided to children and members of their families to assist in preserving  		the family structure. In cases where family problems cannot be resolved,  		services are provided to obtain suitable adoptive homes for the children.</p>
<p><b><i>15.1.2 Authorization, History and Funding</i></b></p>
<p>State grants for child welfare services are authorized under Title IV-B  		of the Social Security Act. Such grants have been authorized under the Social  		Security Act since its enactment in 1935. Amendments to the act in recent years  		(1972 and 1980) have increased funding and focused the grants on supporting  		more Adoption assistance activities especially for hard to place children, to  		minimize the need for foster care placements.</p>
<p>Title IV-B grants are 75% Federally funded and in FY 1989, $247 million  		in Federal appropriations were allocated to the States and territories. States  		are given a base amount plus an allotment based on a formula which accounts for  		population under 21 years old and per capita income.</p>
<p><b><i>15.1.3 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>The Title IV-B program is administered at the Federal level by the  		Administration for Children Youth and Families, Office of Human Development  		Services within the Department of Health and Human Services. Grants are made to  		States that conduct an inventory of children who have been in foster care for  		over 6 months; implement a Statewide information system on children in foster  		care; and initiate a case review system that includes each child in foster  		care. The case review system must incorporate a 6-month review and 18-month  		dispositional hearing for each child; be designed to achieve placement in the  		least restrictive setting and in close proximity to the child's home; and  		provide procedural safeguards for children, parents, and foster care providers.  		Finally, States must implement a program designed to assist children, where  		possible, to return to their homes.</p>
<p><b><i>15.1.4 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>There are no Federal eligibility requirements for receipt of services  		under the State Grant Program.</p>
<p><b><i>15.1.5 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>Funding is provided to States for services to support the family  		structure and promote family reunification such as counseling, and day care  		services. Funds may be used to support personnel for protective services to  		children; to fund licensing and standard setting for private child care  		agencies and institutions; to provide homemaker services; and to work toward  		the return of runaway children.</p>
<h3>15.2 Title IV-E Foster Care and Title IV-E Adoption  		Assistance</h3>
<p><b><i>15.2.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The Title IV-E Foster Care program is an entitlement program which  		provides open-ended matching funds to States for the maintenance payments made  		for AFDC-eligible children in foster care family homes or child care  		institutions of 25 persons or less. The Title IV-E Adoption Assistance Program  		is also an open-ended entitlement program which requires States to develop  		adoption assistance agreements with the adoptive parents of children with  		"special needs." Since the Adoption Assistance program is the Federal program  		which is primarily used to provide adoption services for children with various  		disabilities, the remainder of this section presents a discussion of this  		component of the Title IV-E program only.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.2 Authorization, History and Funding</i></b></p>
<p>The Adoption Assistance Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-272) established Title IV-E  		of the Social Security Act which authorized an adoption assistance program to  		assist States in promoting and facilitating the adoption of children with  		special needs. The program is 50% Federally funded for up to $2,000 in State  		expenditures per adoptive placement. Estimated State claims for Adoption  		Assistance Services in FY 1989 are $112 million.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.3 Definition of Disability</i></b></p>
<p>The Adoption Assistance program serves children with special needs.  		Children with special needs are those who have a specific factor or condition  		that makes it difficult to place the child in an adoptive home such as age,  		ethnic background, or physical, mental or emotional handicaps. States have  		considerable latitude in defining "special needs" eligibility criteria and  		individually determining whether a child is eligible.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.4 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>The program is administered by the Administration for Children, Youth  		and Families, the same office within Health and Human Services that administers  		the Title IV-B program.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.5 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>Under the Title IV-E authority, States are reimbursed for payments of  		nonrecurring expenses of adoption as well as ongoing expenses for all children  		with special needs. As was summarized previously, a child with special needs:  		1) cannot or should not be returned to the home of the parents; 2) has a  		specific factor or condition that makes it difficult for the child to be placed  		in an adoptive home without providing assistance (i.e., age, ethnic background,  		or physical, mental or emotional handicaps); and, 3) except where it would not  		be in the best interest of the child, a reasonable effort must be made to place  		the child in an adoptive home without providing special adoption assistance. In  		most States, the Adoption Unit within the State Department of Social Services  		determines whether a child meets the special needs definition. Children aged  		0-18 are covered unless the State determines that the child has a physical or  		mental handicap which allows continuation of payments until the age of 21.</p>
<p>There are no income requirements that must be meet by adoptive parents  		of children with special needs.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.6 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>The Adoption Assistance program provides financial assistance to assist  		adoptive parents with nonrecurring, or one time expenses at the time of  		adoption. In addition, families continue to receive ongoing assistance at a  		level that is negotiated between the parents and the State agency. The amount  		of the adoption assistance benefit cannot exceed the State foster care payment  		rate. In 1988, it was estimated that the average benefit per placement was  		$1,800 per year.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.7 Program Interactions</i></b></p>
<p>The State will determine the amount of the adoption assistance payments  		through an agreement with the adoptive parents. If a child receives SSI and is  		eligible for adoption assistance, the child's SSI payment will be reduced by  		the amount of the adoption assistance payment, Children provided benefits  		through adoption assistance are also eligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p><b><i>15.2.8 Program Data</i></b></p>
<p>In FY 1989, an estimated 38,000 children with special needs were  		receiving monthly payments under the Adoption Assistance program. Total State  		claims for adoption assistance services in FY 1989 are estimated at $112  		million, of which the Federal share was about $73 million.</p>
<p>There is little available data on the specific characteristics of  		"special needs" children provided adoption assistance under the Title IV-E  		program.</p>
<h2><a name="Ed" id="Ed">CHAPTER 16. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) offers educational and vocational  		rehabilitation programs for individuals with disabilities through the DOE  		Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. The educational  		program supports State efforts in providing special education and related  		services to handicapped children from birth to age twenty-one. The vocational  		rehabilitation programs, administered by the Rehabilitative Services  		Administration, is focused on post-educational opportunities for handicapped  		individuals. There are no age requirements for the vocational rehabilitation  		program, unlike the special education programs, but over 90% of the  		participants are age eighteen or older. In this chapter, four Federally-funded  		special education programs will be profiled, followed by a profile of the  		vocational rehabilitation program.</p>
<p>The largest special education grant program is authorized under Part B  		of the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA-B). The goal of this program is to  		provide a free public education to all handicapped children ages three to  		twenty-one. A second program, the Program for Handicapped Children in  		State-Operated Programs targets children from birth to age 20 who are currently  		enrolled in State-operated or State-supported schools and institutions and who  		are not served under EHA-B.</p>
<p>Two other programs concentrate on early education and intervention  		programs. The Preschool Grants Program provides special education programs and  		services to handicapped children three to five years old and the Handicapped  		Infants and Toddlers Program provides early intervention services to  		handicapped children from birth through age two.</p>
<p>Except for the Program for Handicapped Children in State-Operated  		Programs, the funds for the special education programs may, and do, support  		some of the same populations. For example, the discretionary part of the  		funding for the EHA-B programs may be used for early intervention services or  		programs for younger children if the State so chooses. Each State has developed  		a unique range of special education programs depending on their particular  		needs and interests.</p>
<h3>16.1 State Grants for Special Education Programs</h3>
<p><b><i>16.1.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The State Grants for Special Education Programs (EHA-B) support States  		in providing special education and related services to handicapped children  		ages three through twenty-one.</p>
<p><b><i>16.1.2 Authorization, History and Funding</i></b></p>
<p>The program was originally established in 1966 by the addition of Title  		VI to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Over the years, amendments to  		the Act have expanded the program and committed increased funding. In 1975, the  		Education for All Handicapped Children's Act (P.L. 94-142), dramatically  		increased the Federal commitment to educating all handicapped children.</p>
<p>In 1988, Federal funding was $1.12 billion, in 1989 Federal funding is  		expected to be $1.91 billion and in 1990, Federal funding is expected to be  		$1.53 billion. The States are required to match the Federal funding with 94% of  		the program costs. In FY 1988, the State grants ranged from $123 million to  		California, and $92 million to Texas, to $2.8 million to Vermont. The maximum  		amount of funding per State is equal to the number of handicapped children aged  		3 through 21 who are currently receiving special education services multiplied  		by 40% of the average expenditure per pupil in public schools. The number of  		handicapped children included is capped at 12% of the total number of children  		between 5 and 17 in the State. The State Educational Agency is required to  		channel at least 75% of its funds received from the Federal grant to local  		educational agencies (i.e., intermediate or local school districts).</p>
<p><b><i>16.1.3 Definition of Disability</i></b></p>
<p>The program services children in the following disability categories:  		mental retardation, hearing impaired, speech impaired, visually handicapped,  		seriously emotionally disturbed, orthopedically impaired, other health  		impaired, deaf-blind, multi-handicapped, or severely learning disabled.</p>
<p><b><i>16.1.4 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>The Federal program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education,  		Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which distributes  		funds to the States. The State programs are administered through State  		educational agencies which in turn distribute and administer funds to local  		educational agencies.</p>
<p>Each State must submit an annual program plan to be eligible for a  		grant. The plan must include the development and use of an individualized  		education program for each handicapped student, the establishment of procedural  		safeguards for all handicapped children and their parents, the training of  		personnel for special education programs, and the development of a plan to  		identify, locate and evaluate all handicapped children in all public and  		private agencies and institutions in the State. The plan must cover handicapped  		children ages three to twenty-one unless the State law indicates otherwise.</p>
<p><b><i>16.1.5 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>To receive special education services a child must be evaluated and  		found to be in one of the above mentioned handicapped categories. The  		evaluation is conducted under the auspices of a State or local educational  		agency depending on which agency is administering the program. The evaluation  		must be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team or group, including at least  		one specialist with knowledge in the area of suspected disability. The  		evaluation consists of a variety of tests and other evaluation materials and no  		single test may be used as the sole criterion for determining eligibility. The  		child must be re-evaluated at least once every three years and more frequently  		if necessary.</p>
<p><b><i>16.1.6 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>The provision of special education for handicapped children includes  		classroom instruction, instruction in physical education, home instruction, and  		instruction in hospitals and institutions. In addition to providing direct  		special education, the State and local educational agencies can use grant money  		to provide related services which are required to help a handicapped child  		benefit from special education. These services include diagnostic services,  		occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech/language pathology,  		psychological services, counseling, school health services, and social work  		services in school.</p>
<p>After channeling 75% of its funds to local educational agencies, the  		State may use the remaining 25% of its funds for a range of State-established  		priorities. Up to 5% or $350,000, whichever is greater, may be used for  		administrative costs. Some States channel the remaining 20% to local  		educational agencies and some use the money to provide direct and/or support  		services for priority programs, such as targeting the handicapped preschool  		population or other underserved handicapped children.</p>
<p><b><i>16.1.7 Program Data</i></b></p>
<p>In the 1985-86 school year, 4,121,104 handicapped children aged 3 to 21  		years were served under the State grants and in 1986-87, 4,166,692 children  		were served. This represents a 1.2% increase in the total number of handicapped  		children served between the 1986 and 1987 school years.</p>
<h3>16.2 Program for Handicapped Children in State-Operated  		Programs</h3>
<p><b><i>16.2.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The purpose of the program is to expand or improve educational services  		to handicapped children from birth to age 20 who are currently enrolled in  		State-operated or State-supported schools, programs, and institutions.</p>
<p><b><i>16.2.2 Authorization, History and Funding</i></b></p>
<p>The program is authorized under Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation  		Improvement Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-35) as it amends Title 1 of the Elementary and  		Secondary Education Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-10). In FY 1987, $150 million was  		granted to the States and in FY 1986, $144 million was granted. Each State  		receives funds based on the number of handicapped children served in the  		previous year. The number of children includes 1) handicapped children  		currently enrolled in State-operated and State-supported institutions and 2)  		children who were enrolled in a State institution for at least a full school  		year during the school year 1971-1972 or any subsequent year and who are  		currently receiving their education through a local public school. If this is  		the case, the State agency must transfer the funds to the local educational  		agency currently serving the child. A State may not receive funds for the same  		child under this program and EHA-B.</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>16.2.3 Definition of Disability</i></b></p>
<p>The definition of disability used in determining eligibility for  		handicapped children in State-operated programs is the same as that used for  		EHA-B programs.</p>
<p><b><i>16.2.4 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>The administrative structure of this program is the same as for EHA-B,  		although the requirements for State agencies differ under this program. To  		receive funds, a State agency operating a State-operated or State-supported  		institution must submit a project application to the State educational agency.  		The application must include the number of handicapped children to be served  		and their handicapping conditions, an assessment of their educational needs,  		and the types of services that will be provided. In addition, the application  		must describe how the use of the funds will be evaluated and how the project  		will be coordinated with other Federal, State, and local agencies. Each year,  		an agency receiving funds must submit an annual report to the State educational  		agency detailing the number of children served and the number transferring to a  		local educational agency during the school year.</p>
<p>If a handicapped child transfers from a State-operated or  		State-supported institution to a-school under the jurisdiction of a local  		educational agency, then the per capita funds for that individual are  		transferred with them. In order to receive such funds, a local educational  		agency must have submitted an application to the State educational agency  		detailing their program.</p>
<p><b><i>16.2.5 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>Handicapped children from birth to age 20 who attend State-operated or  		State-supported institutions are eligible to be covered by this program. As  		under the EHA-B program, each child must be evaluated by the State to determine  		eligibility (i.e., meet the definition of disability) and to assess the needs  		of the individual child.</p>
<p><b><i>16.2.6 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>The services provided are the same as those provided under EHA-B. As  		under EHA-B, the States may use a portion of their funds for a range of  		State-established priorities. For example, some States have developed programs  		to ease the transition of students from State institutions to local community  		schools. Other States have opted to fund and develop home intervention programs  		for preschoolers.</p>
<p><b><i>16.2.7 Program Data</i></b></p>
<p>For the 1985-86 school year, this program served 249,140 handicapped  		children. For the 1986-87 school year, 254,909 children were served, compared  		to 4,166,692 handicapped children under the EHA-B program. The average per  		pupil annual allocation was $588 in FY 1987, $572 in FY 1986, $587 in FY 1985,  		and $593 in FY 1984.</p>
<h3>16.3 Preschool Incentive Grants Program/Preschool Grants  		Program</h3>
<p><b><i>16.3.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The Preschool Grants Program is designed to ensure that by 1991,  		<b>all</b> handicapped children aged 3 through 5 will have access to a free  		appropriate public education.</p>
<p><b><i>16.3.2 Authorization, History and Funding</i></b></p>
<p>The Preschool Incentive Grants Program first funded in 1977, was the  		original program targeting this handicapped population. In 1986, amendments to  		the 1975 Education for all Handicapped Children Act, Part B, changed both the  		name and purpose of the program. The new Preschool Grants Programs was  		developed to ensure that 100% of handicapped 3 to 5 year olds would have access  		to a free appropriate public education. The Federal funding level in FY 1986,  		the last year the program was called the Preschool Incentive Grant Program, was  		$28.7 million. Under the new Preschool Grant Program, the Federal funding for  		FY 1987 was $180 million. Of this, $80 million was for services provided to  		children already in the program and $100 million was for children expected to  		be newly identified and served by the program.</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>16.3.3 Definition of- Disability</i></b></p>
<p>The definition of disability used in determining eligibility for  		handicapped children in preschool programs is the same as that used for EHA-B  		programs.</p>
<p><b><i>16.3.4 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>The administrative structure of this program is the same as for EHA-B  		although the requirements for State agencies differ under this program. To  		receive funds, the State must submit an application to the Federal Secretary of  		Education through the State educational agency. The State must already have an  		approved plan for the EHA-B program and must already provide special education  		and related services to handicapped children aged three, four, or five.</p>
<p>As of FY 1988, states were required to channel 75% of their grant to  		local educational agencies and were limited to using 5% of the grant for  		administration. The State may use the other 20% for a range of  		State-established priorities. Before FY 1988, States had to channel at least  		70% to local educational agencies.</p>
<p><b><i>16.3.5 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>Handicapped children ages three to five are eligible to receive services  		through this program. As under the EHA-B program, each child must be evaluated  		by the State to determine eligibility (i.e., meet the definition of disability)  		and to assess the needs of the individual child.</p>
<p><b><i>16.3.6 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>The services provided are the same as those provided under EHA-B. In  		addition, the State must have a program to identify and locate new handicapped  		preschoolers through such activities as involvement in interagency groups,  		sponsoring public awareness programs, and conducting child finding activities.  		The States may also elect to fund other types of activities, such as providing  		training and technical assistance to existing programs or planning and  		developing a comprehensive system of service delivery for handicapped  		children.</p>
<p><b><i>16.3.7 Program Data</i></b></p>
<p>By 1986, the Preschool Incentive Grants Program had succeeded in getting  		all eligible State agencies to participate in the program which resulted in  		them reaching an estimated 75% of all handicapped children ages 3 through 5.  		However, in order to reach the goal of serving all eligible children by 1991,  		the Federal government sought to increase the pace of the program by committing  		more funds. The Federal government increased the annual per child allocation  		from $110 in FY 1986 under the original program to $300 in FY 1987, $400 in FY  		1988, $500 in FY 1989, and $1,000 in FY 1989, where it will remain for  		subsequent years. Additionally, in order to promote locating and assisting all  		handicapped children for this age group, the Federal government committed  		$3,800 to the States for each newly identified handicapped child to be served  		for FY 1987 through FY 1989. In order to remain eligible to receive funding  		under the grant program, States must provide services to all 3 to 5 year old  		handicapped children by 1991.</p>
<h3>16.4 Handicapped Infants and Toddlers Program</h3>
<p><b><i>16.4.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to expand and improve the provision of  		early intervention programs for infants and young children with handicaps. The  		intervention programs are designed to minimize the child's potential for  		developmental delay so that the child will be less likely to need special  		education services in school and/or be institutionalized later in life.</p>
<table title="EXHIBIT 16-5: Number of Children Served in Preschool Incentive Grant Programs 1980 to 1987"><tr><td><b><font><a name="exhibit16-5" id="exhibit16-5">EXHIBIT 16-5</a>: Number of Children  			 Served in Preschool Incentive Grant Programs 1980 to 1987</font></b></td>

</tr></table><p><b><i>16.4.3 Definition of Disability</i></b></p>
<p>This program focuses on children with developmental delays or children  		who are at risk for developmental delays in one or more of the following areas:  		cognitive development, physical development, language and speech development,  		psychosocial development, or self-help skills. Each State develops its own  		working definition of developmental delay.</p>
<p><b><i>16.4.4 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>The administrative structure of this program is similar to that of  		EHA-B. The program is administered nationally by the U.S. Department of  		Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which  		distributes the funds to the States. The Governor of each State designates a  		lead agency which administers and monitors the program. Each participating  		State must establish a State Interagency Coordinating Council, comprised of 15  		members, which assists t e lead agency in developing a coordinated system and  		is responsible for submitting an annual report to the Governor and to the  		Federal Secretary of Education. By 1987, about one-third of the States had  		designated as lead agencies state Educational Agencies, another third chose the  		State Health Departments and the remainder chose a different agency such as  		Social Services, or Human Resources, or interdepartmental committees.</p>
<p>To receive funding, States must develop and implement a comprehensive,  		coordinated, interagency program of early intervention services for handicapped  		infants and toddlers and their families and facilitate the coordination of  		payment for early intervention services from Federal, State, and local  		government, as well as from private sources.</p>
<p><b><i>16.4.5 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>States are authorized to serve handicapped children from birth to age  		two who are experiencing delays, children who are likely to experience delays  		due to particular mental or physical conditions, and children who are at risk  		for developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided. As  		previously mentioned, each State may determine a definition for developmental  		delay.</p>
<p><b><i>16.4.6 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>At a minimum, the State system must provide developmental services  		which: are free of charge unless the State law indicates otherwise, meet the  		child's physical, cognitive, psychosocial, language and speech developmental  		needs, meet State standards, and are provided by qualified personnel, including  		special educators, physical therapists, social workers, and nurses. Allowable  		services include family training counseling and home visits, special  		instruction, and speech pathology and audiology. Like the Preschool Incentive  		Grants Program, this program must conduct activities to identify individuals  		eligible for the program.</p>
<h3>16.5 Basic Vocational Rehabilitation Services</h3>
<p><b><i>16.5.1 Overview and Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>The Basic Vocational Rehabilitation Service Program supports the States  		in assisting physically and mentally handicapped individuals become gainfully  		employed. Unlike the special education programs, the vocational rehabilitation  		program does not use age as one of the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.2 Authorization, History and Funding</i></b></p>
<p>The program is authorized under Title I of the the Rehabilitation Act of  		1973, as amended. Vocational rehabilitation programs date back to 1920 when  		Congress passed the National Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1920, authorizing  		the first program to help disabled civilians regain work skills. The program  		has been expanding ever since and most recently has been focusing on serving  		individuals with the most severe handicaps.</p>
<p>In FY 1988, Federal funding was $1.38 billion and in FY 1989, Federal  		funding is expected to be $1.44 billion. The State share of funds for the  		program is 20%. Beginning in FY 1989, the Federal share for the amount of  		funding above the previous year for each State decreases by 1% per year for  		five years. For example, in 1989 the Federal share of the increased amount of  		funding is 79% and in 1990 it will be 78%. This change in the Federal share  		applies to the development and provision of vocational rehabilitation  		services.</p>
<p>In FY 1989, an estimated $1.44 billion was allocated among the States  		according to a formula based on population and per capita income. California  		received $114 million, the largest allocation, followed by Texas with $92  		million, New York with $85 million and Pennsylvania with $72 million. The  		minimum level of funding allowed is $4 million for States; however, there is no  		minimum funding level for territories.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.3 Definition of Disability</i></b></p>
<p>The definition of disability used for this program is based on a  		physical or mental handicap that limits an individual's ability to be  		employed.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.4 Administrative Structure</i></b></p>
<p>This program is nationally administered by the U.S. Department of  		Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services,  		Rehabilitative Services Administration (RSA). RSA distributes funds to State  		agencies who develop and administer their State program.</p>
<p>The State administering agency must submit a State plan every 3 years  		which must be approved before the agency can receive Federal funds. Some States  		have two vocational rehabilitation agencies, one for the blind and one for  		people with other disabilities. In FY 1987, 27 States and territories had two  		such agencies. The State plan must assure the fair determination of  		eligibility, must provide a plan for a preliminary diagnostic study for those  		referred for rehabilitation, and must provide a thorough diagnostic study for  		those individuals found eligible for rehabilitation services. Ineligible  		determinations based on the finding that an individual cannot be expected to  		achieve a vocational goal, must be reviewed within 12 months of the  		determination.</p>
<p>If services cannot be provided to all eligible individuals who apply,  		then two groups of individuals should be given priority for services: those  		with the most severe handicaps and those public safety officers who sustained a  		disability in the line of duty.</p>
<p>There is no Federal requirement that the financial need of an individual  		be considered by a State when providing vocational rehabilitation services.  		However, a State may choose to consider the financial need of applicants for  		certain services and require that individuals share in the costs of services.  		The State may not use a financial needs test for the following services:  		evaluation of rehabilitation potential, counseling, guidance, referral, and  		placement.</p>
<p>The 1984 amendments to the act require States receiving basic vocational  		rehabilitation services funding to have a Client Assistance Program (CAP). CAP  		advises clients and client applicants of available services under the  		Rehabilitation Act and works to protect client's rights under the Act. The CAP  		must be administered by an agency that does not provide services under the  		Rehabilitation Act unless the agency had a CAP before 1984 and received Federal  		funding. Like the Vocational Rehabilitation Program, CAPs are supported by  		direct funding from the Federal Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA).  		In 1987, $7.1 million in grants was awarded to CAP programs in the 50 States,  		D.C. and the 8 territories, based on the relative population of each State.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.5 Eligibility</i></b></p>
<p>Eligibility is based upon "the presence of a physical or mental  		disability which for the individual constitutes or results in a substantial  		handicap to employment and a reasonable expectation that vocational  		rehabilitation services may benefit the individual in terms of employability"  		(34 CFR Ch.III, 361.31). Type of disability and State residency cannot be used  		in determining eligibility.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.6 Services/Benefits Provided</i></b></p>
<p>The State is required to provide many vocational rehabilitation services  		including, evaluation of vocational rehabilitation potential, counseling and  		guidance, physical and mental restoration services, and vocational and other  		training services.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.7 Program Interactions</i></b></p>
<p>States are required to determine if comparable services and benefits are  		available to their clients or their families under other programs. This  		requirement does not apply to the following services: evaluation of  		rehabilitation potential; counseling, guidance, and referral; vocational and  		other training services; placement; rehabilitation engineering services; and  		post-employment services.</p>
<p><b><i>16.5.8 Program Data</i></b></p>
<p>The number of clients served each year in the program has decreased from  		1,095,139 in 1980 to 917,482 in 1987, although in the last five years the  		decline in the number of clients served has leveled off. In 1985, 28.3% of the  		clients were served at a cost of $100 to $1,000 per client per year, 15.9% at a  		cost between $1,000 and $2,000, 15.1% at a cost between $2,000 and $4,000, and  		10.6% cost over $4,000 per year. In 1987, 62.1% of the severely disabled  		clients were rehabilitated in that they found work and maintained the job for  		at least 60 days under the program, with most States' severely disabled  		rehabilitation rate falling between 50 and 70%.</p>
