<hr /><p>Twenty-one states have implemented "wage pass-through" programs with the  		stated expectation that doing so will help address the shortage of direct-care  		workers employed by long-term care providers in their states. A wage  		pass-through is an additional allocation of funds provided through Medicaid  		reimbursement for the express purpose of increasing compensation for  		direct-care workers. The purpose of this issue brief is to:</p>
<ul><li>Describe the structure of wage pass-through programs in selected  		  states;</li>
<li>Summarize what is known about the impact of these programs on the  		  recruitment and retention of direct-care workers; and</li>
<li>Identify key design elements that states should consider if they  		  choose to implement a wage pass-through.</li>
</ul><h2>THE DIRECT-CARE LABOR MARKET: BACKGROUND</h2>
<h3>Increasing Demand</h3>
<p>The demand for direct-care workers in nursing homes and in home and  		other community-based long-term care settings is increasing rapidly as the  		population ages and rising numbers of people with disabilities of all ages need  		assistance. While the long-term care field has long been characterized by a  		high rate of worker turnover, in recent years, providers -- home health  		agencies, nursing homes and assisted living facilities -- and consumers  		directing services in their own homes have experienced increasing difficulty  		finding workers to fill the positions at all. A recent General Accounting  		Office study reported annual turnover rates for nursing home aides ranging from  		40 to 100 percent.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> In  		2002, 37 states reported that they consider the direct-care shortage a serious  		workforce issue.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Below Average Industry Wage</h3>
<p>One reason providers find it difficult to recruit and retain direct-care  		staff is that the prevailing industry wage is below average, while the work is  		demanding. In 1999, the median wage of direct-care workers was $7.97 per hour,  		one-third less than the median wage for all workers across all occupations  		($11.87 per hour). In 2000, the median wage for direct-care workers increased  		slightly to $8.21 per hour. As shown in <a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#table1">Table 1</a>, these  		wages fall below federal poverty levels,<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note3">3</a></font></sup> especially for home care aides. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="table1" id="table1"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/66241/wagefg1.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>A 2002 labor market analysis of direct-care workers in California,  		sponsored by the California Employment Development Department, found caregiver  		occupations in that state were paid lower wages and benefits than competing  		occupations and offered fewer opportunities for advancement. For example, when  		comparing wages for competing occupations in the same geographic area as a  		nursing facility, researchers found that the hourly wage of nursing assistants  		at the facility averaged 10 percent less than that of other wage earners in the  		area.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note4">4</a></font></sup> These low  		prevailing wage rates have made it difficult for many long-term care providers  		to compete for workers with other employers offering less physically and  		emotionally demanding, low-wage jobs. Even as the economy has slowed, providers  		have seen little improvement in their ability to recruit and retain direct-care  		staff.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Faced with significant shortages of direct-care workers in long-term  		care, 21 states have enacted wage pass-through provisions as part of their  		Medicaid programs. These provisions are intended to provide additional state  		and federal dollars to long-term care providers to fund an increase in  		direct-care worker wages. <a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#table2">Table 2</a> summarizes recently  		enacted state wage pass-through legislation.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>

<p>Medicaid, jointly funded by federal and state government and  		administered by the states, is the largest source of funding for long-term care  		services (see <a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#table3">Table 3</a>). Reimbursement by Medicaid  		programs creates the framework within which employers set wages for direct-care  		workers. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="table3" id="table3"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/66241/wagefg3.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>Most states establish Medicaid payment rates for nursing homes, Medicaid  		home- and community-based waiver services, and personal care based on the  		providers' expenditures in a designated prior year and then make adjustments to  		account for inflation or other factors that impact costs. For each provider  		group, states can either establish a single payment rate or set different  		amounts, determined by size of the facility, acuity of patient mix, ownership,  		geography, or other criteria. The payment rate contains detailed direction to  		providers on which costs are allowable, including costs of compensation to  		workers. Typically, in order to control Medicaid program costs, states set  		their rates near the average (mean), middle (median), or 70-90<sup>th</sup>  		percentile of historic expenditures of all the providers in the payment class.  		</p>
<p>If either the initial base rate or the annual updates are set too low,  		the Medicaid payment will be too low to cover provider costs, including the  		amount spent on wages. In addition, the rate setting mechanism creates  		incentives for providers to keep all costs, including wages down. These state  		limits discourage providers from incurring costs beyond the allowable amount;  		if a provider pays higher wages or hires more workers, or incurs other added  		costs, these costs will not be reimbursed by the state. </p>
<p>During periods of high competition for labor, wages across the entire  		workforce begin to rise but direct-care wages cannot keep pace since, by its  		very nature, a payment system based on historic average expenditures does not  		reflect current conditions. At such times, the gap between direct-care wages  		and other wages widens. Turnover and vacancies increase, as direct-care workers  		are attracted to higher paying jobs and providers experience difficulty  		attracting new workers. To address this situation, many states make wage  		adjustments to make the compensation of direct-care workers competitive. Some  		states elect to increase their Medicaid reimbursement rates permanently and  		enhance wages by increasing allowable costs for the salaries of workers in  		caregiving occupations. Other states have implemented a wage pass-through to  		make this adjustment, providing a one-time additional allocation in Medicaid  		reimbursement funds for the express purpose of increasing compensation for  		direct-care workers. </p>
<h2>WAGE PASS-THROUGH ANALYSIS</h2>
<h3>Effectiveness of Wage Pass-Through Programs</h3>
<p>Data on the impact of wage pass-through programs on the recruitment and  		retention of direct-care workers are limited. A follow-up survey conducted by  		the North Carolina Division of Facility Services of 12 states that implemented  		wage pass-through programs found that:</p>
<ul><li>Three states said their wage pass-through program had no impact on  		  recruitment and retention of direct-care workers;</li>
<li>Three states could not determine whether wage pass-through programs  		  measurably affected recruitment and retention; and</li>
<li>Four states reported that their wage pass-through program either had  		  a positive impact on recruitment and retention or "probably had some positive  		  impact" on those issues.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note7">7</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Within the past three years, formal evaluations of wage pass-through  		programs have been conducted in only three states: Michigan (2000),  		Massachusetts (2001), and Kansas (2001). The results of these evaluations are  		ambiguous.</p>
<ul><li>Michigan found that, in 13 years of providing annual wage  		  pass-through funds, wages earned by certified nurse assistants increased by 61  		  percent while turnover rates for that position decreased by 21 percent during  		  that time.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note8">8</a></font></sup></li>
<li>A survey of Massachusetts' nursing homes found that the wage  		  pass-through contributed to an overall increase of 8.7 percent in nurse aide  		  wages in the first year. In combination with a broad package of interventions  		  enacted by the legislature, Massachusetts' nursing homes reported improved  		  stabilization in their vacancy rates after several years of escalating  		  vacancies.</li>
<li>In Kansas, one year after implementing a wage pass-through program,  		  the annualized turnover rates for all positions eligible for wage pass-through  		  funds decreased slightly from 111 to 101 percent. The Kansas program funded  		  less than half of the increase in wages identified as needed by the  		  providers.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note9">9</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>A review of current data does not support the efficacy of wage  		pass-through programs. There may be a variety of reasons for this, such as the  		timing of existing legislative efforts, the lack of a common methodology used  		to measure recruitment or retention, or the difficulty of isolating the effect  		of a wage pass-through from other recruitment or retention initiatives.  		Nonetheless, many state legislators are embracing wage pass-throughs as one of  		a series of potential options. As one state legislative leader said, a wage  		pass-through is a "down payment" -- the first step toward a more comprehensive  		effort to sustain a competent and stable long-term care workforce.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The political process, however, may be too uncertain to guarantee that  		provider funding will keep up with its actual labor costs and competitive  		market wages. Medicaid funding is subject to the state budgetary process. State  		Medicaid budgets for all programs and services are set through annual or  		bi-annual legislative appropriations. Since both provider rates and  		pass-through amounts are set within the context of the state budget process,  		provider payments -- and thus, indirectly, wages to workers -- are dependent on  		overall budget availability and on the political choices governors and state  		legislators must make between competing spending priorities within that budget.  		</p>
<h3>Approaches to Structuring a Wage Pass-Through</h3>
<p>Two methods are commonly used by states to calculate the amount to be  		allocated for wage pass-through programs. States can either identify a set  		dollar amount to increase worker wages "per hour" or "per patient-day" within  		the Medicaid reimbursement rate, or states can require that providers spend a  		percentage of a specific rate increase on higher compensation. A survey of  		states in 1999 found that 10 of 16 states implementing wage pass-throughs used  		a set dollar figure, with pass-through amounts ranging from 50 cents to $2.14  		per hour or up to $4.93 per patient-day. The remaining six states established  		wage pass-throughs as a percentage of the increased reimbursement rate. For  		example, 80 percent of Minnesota's 40 percent rate increase was earmarked for  		wages and benefits.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>These methods determine the amount available for increases in wages.  		Regardless of how the wage pass-through is calculated, states must also decide  		whether to give explicit direction to providers about how the money can be used  		(e.g., exclusively for increases in base hourly wages) or to allow them  		flexibility to use the funds in a variety of ways -- increasing staffing hours,  		targeting the increases to hard to fill shifts, or paying retention bonuses.  		</p>
<h3>Designing and Implementing a Wage Pass-Through</h3>
<p>States have confronted a number of design issues as they have  		implemented wage pass-throughs. </p>
<ol><li><b>Size of the Wage Increase</b>: At what level should the proposed  		  wage increase be set to attract/retain workers to direct-care jobs?</li>
<li><b>Equity</b>: Will the wage increase be extended to direct-care  		  workers across all health care settings? Only in long-term care settings? Or  		  only within a subset of long-term care providers?</li>
<li><b>Universality</b>: Is provider participation in the wage  		  pass-through to be optional or mandatory?</li>
<li><b>Specificity</b>: How flexible or specific should the guidelines be  		  for use of the funds?</li>
<li><b>Accountability</b>: What audit and enforcement procedures need to  		  be in place and how do they relate to existing payment and auditing  		  systems?</li>
<li><b>Continuity</b>: Will funding for the pass-through be a one-time  		  wage adjustment or will it be built into the rate as a base for subsequent  		  years?</li>
<li><b>Notice</b>: How much time and education do providers need to  		  implement the increase as envisioned by the state? </li>
</ol><h4>Size of the Wage Increase</h4>
<p>The intent of a wage pass-through is to reduce vacancies and turnover  		among direct-care staff. Therefore, it must be set at a level that is likely to  		affect the behavior of both potential new applicants and existing workers. Each  		state determines the size of the wage increase to be proposed, using a variety  		of factors that can include:</p>
<ul><li>The current industry wage in the state</li>
<li>How the current wage compares with the industry wage in surrounding  		  states</li>
<li>How the current wage compares with competing employment  		  opportunities</li>
<li>The cost of living and the general economic condition of the state  		  </li>
</ul><p>The state of Wyoming provides an example of how one state calculated the  		wage rate for its wage pass-through program. In response to a request from the  		state legislature for an analysis of the salary and benefit levels necessary to  		attract, retain, and build a skilled direct-care workforce, the Wyoming  		Department of Health in 2001 recommended increasing entry-level wages of  		direct-care workers by $3.31 per hour from an average of $6.92 to $10.23 per  		hour.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note12">12</a></font></sup> The recommended  		new wage rate was set at 90 percent of the regional average hourly wage paid to  		all low-wage workers in similar jobs in 12 western states.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note13">13</a></font></sup> A statewide survey of former  		direct-care workers who had left the field also supported the Department of  		Health's recommendation. The survey found that $10 per hour (more for workers  		with experience) is the wage at which most former workers reported they would  		have stayed. In addition, direct-care worker wages in the state were compared  		with wages of workers with equivalent levels of education and training. The  		state found that merely matching the local entry-level wage in retail and  		service industries would not be sufficient given the stress and difficulty of  		direct-care positions. </p>
<h4>Equity</h4>
<p>In implementing a wage pass-through, states must decide how to allocate  		it. Should it include all new and existing direct-care workers in both nursing  		home and community-based settings or should it be targeted to a subset of  		workers where the perceived need for workers is the greatest? Most wage  		pass-through programs have typically been directed toward nursing home workers  		since state Medicaid spending for long-term care goes primarily to pay for care  		in nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note14">14</a></font></sup>  		However, targeting a subset of direct-care workers can have unintended  		consequences, for example, creating tension between the "haves" and "have-nots"  		and encouraging workers to move between health care settings in search of  		higher wages. </p>
<p>Similarly, a wage pass will not impact providers equally. Because  		nursing homes and other Medicaid providers often have a mix of Medicaid and  		non-Medicaid recipients, each provider will receive a different amount of money  		to distribute to their direct-care workforce. Workers in facilities/agencies  		with larger numbers of Medicaid recipients will receive a higher wage increase  		than those in facilities/agencies with fewer Medicaid recipients, unless the  		participating provider or the state supplements the Medicaid wage pass-through  		with additional, non-Medicaid funding. </p>
<p>Both California and Massachusetts reported confusion among workers as to  		how big an increase they could expect because of the variation based on  		providers' Medicaid censuses. As a result, after two years of implementing wage  		pass-throughs that left workers confused and disappointed, California passed  		the Wage Adjustment Rate Program (WARP). Under this program, each provider  		negotiates a specific amount for the wage increase with its workers, which is  		then funded through the state's Medi-Cal program.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note15">15</a></font></sup> In Massachusetts, the Coalition to Reform  		Elder Care (CORE) -- a statewide advocacy coalition of consumers, providers,  		social workers, and labor unions -- proposed establishing a reimbursement  		mechanism for the wage pass-through program that bypassed Medicaid altogether,  		setting up a state appropriated fund which would target wage increases to  		individual nursing home providers based on the number of nurse aide hours in  		each facility.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>Universality</h4>
<p>In implementing a wage pass-through program, states must choose whether  		to make provider participation optional or mandatory. In Wyoming, for example,  		one-fifth of the state's long-term care providers chose not to participate,  		fearing that raising wages for direct-care workers would increase other  		compensation-related costs, such as payroll taxes, not funded by the  		increase.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note17">17</a></font></sup> A survey of  		Washington State's nursing homes, conducted shortly after the implementation of  		that state's wage pass-through program, found that 25 percent of the nursing  		home providers did not participate in the program. Key reasons cited by  		providers for not participating included insufficient funding to cover the cost  		of the increase and fear that funding for the raises would not be sustained  		over time.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A wage pass-through raises other issues for providers who have recently  		increased wages. Unless explicitly noted in a state's legislation, raises that  		went into effect prior to the start date of the wage pass-through will not be  		eligible for reimbursement. As a result, providers who already pay more may  		feel that the legislation penalizes them. The possibility of pass-through  		legislation can, therefore, serve as a barrier to providers' increasing wages.  		</p>
<h4>Specificity</h4>
<p>States must also decide how much flexibility or specificity to build  		into their rules for use of wage pass-through funds. Providers generally  		advocate for flexibility in the distribution of funds to allow them to use the  		funds to meet their most pressing financial needs. Workers and consumer  		advocates typically seek detailed instructions on use of funds to ensure that  		funds intended to increase the wages and benefits of direct-care workers are  		used exclusively for that purpose. </p>
<p>While states often require audits or expanded cost reports for wage  		pass-through funds,<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note19">19</a></font></sup>  		they usually determine compliance with the requirements of the legislation by  		monitoring total direct-care compensation expenditures. This practice allows  		providers discretion in using wage pass-through funds to meet what they  		perceive as their most crucial staff needs. For example, rather than directing  		the money to increase base wages, providers might choose to provide shift  		differentials, longevity increases, overtime bonuses, benefits, or end-of year  		bonuses. </p>
<p>It is also possible, depending on the language of the enabling  		legislation, for providers to use pass-throughs to pay for staffing costs that  		are not related to increasing the wages of direct-care workers. For example, a  		survey of Washington State nursing homes found, of 79 respondents, 19 did not  		provide new salary increases. Of these 19 providers, two-thirds used wage  		pass-through funds to defray the cost of raises granted in the recent past.  		Other providers were found to have used a portion of the money to increase the  		salaries of registered and licensed practical nurses rather than low-wage  		direct-care staff as intended by the legislation.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>Accountability</h4>
<p>States that intend to evaluate the impact of the wage pass-through on  		provider expenditures must examine their current auditing and enforcement  		procedures. States implementing wage pass-throughs have employed a number of  		accountability systems including:</p>
<ul><li>Requiring providers to submit a plan describing how they intend to  		  institute the increase;</li>
<li>Conducting a survey of providers after the implementation of the  		  pass-through to determine whether and how they participated;</li>
<li>Requiring providers to submit expanded cost reports; or</li>
<li>Conducting a full state audit.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note21">21</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>If the goal of the wage pass-through is to ensure that direct-care  		workers receive wage increases, the state must go beyond measuring direct-care  		spending in aggregate. Aggregate spending can increase or decrease  		independently of wage levels, because of changes in the number of staff hours  		over the year, a shift in staff composition to a greater number of new hires  		starting at low entry-level wages, a change in the mix of pool and overtime  		use, and other staffing pattern changes. </p>
<p>If the wage pass-through is implemented as a supplement to their  		Medicaid budgets, states may be required to set up a separate auditing system  		to monitor these funds. This can be cumbersome and expensive for both providers  		and the state. </p>
<h4>Continuity</h4>
<p>Many employers are hesitant to increase the base pay of direct-care  		workers with wage pass-through funds because most states finance these  		initiatives with annual or biannual appropriations. Providers fear that these  		programs will not be reauthorized; creating a funding "cliff" that will result  		in an unsustainable labor-cost structure in future years. Given this  		uncertainty, some states, for example California, structured their wage  		pass-through to offer direct-care workers a bonus or other "one-time"  		compensation increase. To avoid creating such a funding "cliff," states can  		also consider integrating their wage pass-through into their regular rate  		structure or they can establish a permanent salary reserve. Louisiana completed  		an incremental step toward the latter strategy by establishing a permanent  		trust fund within the state treasury using state and federal Medicaid funds.  		The interest generated by the fund was dedicated to increasing compensation of  		direct-care personnel employed by Medicaid-certified nursing homes. This  		mechanism, however, is unlikely to generate sufficient revenue to significantly  		increase the wages or benefits of the state's direct-care workforce.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>Providers need clear, timely information on the structure of the  		proposed wage pass-through to implement it effectively. Legislative  		appropriations and Medicaid rate setting, provider fiscal years, and labor  		contracts can work on different calendars: For example, legislatures may set a  		state budget that governs program funds from July 1 through June 30, while the  		rate setting process may work on a regular calendar year, January to December.  		Therefore, effective dates for legislative action should be set to allow state  		agencies to develop rules in time for provider implementation. Thinking through  		the implementation issues ahead of time and addressing them clearly will allow  		all parties to be aware of what is expected. Start dates of wage pass-through  		legislation need to build in enough time for administrating agencies to develop  		implementation policies and notify providers. </p>
<p>In Massachusetts, the state rate-setting agency provided a $20 million  		wage pass-through for calendar year 2001 beginning on January 1. During that  		year, the state budget appropriated an additional $15 million wage for  		increases for the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2001, but subject to  		different rules. This mid-year change led to a lot of confusion among providers  		as to how the funds could be spent.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note23">23</a></font></sup> In California, a wage pass-through was  		passed in August 1999. The money to fund the wage increases began to flow to  		providers in mid-October of that year; however, the state did not publish any  		instructions for providers on how they could spend the funds until April 2000.  		This led to reluctance on the part of some providers to implement the wage  		increases and contributed to findings of poor compliance in the state  		audit.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Through wage pass-through initiatives, states have enacted interim  		interventions to allocate, for a single budget year, new resources to address  		significant shortages of direct-care workers. To date, supporting data are  		lacking to demonstrate the efficacy of the wage pass-through as a tool to  		reduce worker vacancies and turnover. In analyzing implementation of wage  		pass-throughs in 21 states, however, it appears that several key design choices  		can affect the overall impact of the wage pass-through on direct-care worker  		salaries. These design choices include determining:</p>
<ul><li>The size of the salary increase;</li>
<li>To whom it will be targeted;</li>
<li>The amount of flexibility providers have in its implementation;</li>
<li>Whether provider participation will be optional or mandatory;</li>
<li>The type of accountability to be required;</li>
<li>Whether the wage pass-through will be integrated into the on-going  		  wage structure; and</li>
<li>How and when to educate providers about the program. </li>
</ul><p>States considering wage pass-through initiatives also should recognize  		that low wages, by themselves, are not the sole cause of high vacancy and  		turnover among the direct-care workforce. Adequate wage levels are important in  		recruiting and retaining committed and high-quality workers for direct-care  		jobs; however, an increase in wages cannot, by itself, resolve recruitment and  		retention problems. Numerous research studies, conducted in a variety of states  		and spanning all care settings, indicate that factors other than wages and  		benefits are also important for job satisfaction.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note25">25</a></font></sup> Of particular importance is that people in  		caregiver occupations feel they are not respected or valued by the  		administrators and nurse supervisors who manage their work  		environments.<sup><font><a href="state-wage-pass-through-legislation-analysis.html#note26">26</a></font></sup>  		Policymakers and providers also need to look at the clinical and life skills  		education and training provided to workers to help them prepare for the job,  		and the supports -- including on-going education, mentoring and linkages to  		social services -- that may be needed to retain them. In short, solving today's  		workforce shortages and meeting future demands will require policymakers and  		providers to examine not merely workers wages and benefits but also how they  		are educated, trained, supervised, and managed. </p>
