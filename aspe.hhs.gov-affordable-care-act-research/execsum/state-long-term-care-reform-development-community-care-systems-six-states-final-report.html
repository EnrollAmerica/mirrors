<hr /><p></p>
<p>The financing and delivery of long term care services for the elderly is  		one of the most pressing issues facing the states today. For the past two  		decades, state governments have made major commitments to expand these  		services. Those commitments are reflected in the expenditure of state matching  		funds to support services through Medicaid, in the establishment of long term  		care programs financed totally with state general revenues, and in the  		development of detailed policies governing the provision of long term care  		services. </p>
<p>Over the past several years, most states have been faced with severe  		fiscal constraints due to recession-induced revenue declines and reductions in  		federally supported domestic programs. At the same time, there has been  		significant growth in state Medicaid expenditures devoted to nursing home care.  		Long term care spending now accounts for almost half of all expenditures in  		Medicaid, which usually is the largest state-administered program in state  		budgets. These fiscal pressures are compounded by the dramatic rise in the  		number of persons over age seventy-five, the population group most likely to  		need long term care services. Since 1980 this group has grown three times as  		fast as the overall U.S. population. </p>
<p>Until recently long term care services for the elderly were considered  		synonymous with nursing home care. Public officials, physicians, insurers, and  		even the elderly shared this perception. Medicaid became, by default, the  		primary federal and state funding source for long term care services and  		practically the only source of third party payment. Regulations and limited  		community service options under that program reinforced the notion that older  		people needing long term care services by definition needed nursing home care.  		This resulted in an institution-based delivery system. </p>
<p>A policy revolution now is underway. When state debates focus on long  		term care system reform, discussions now are likely to highlight ways to expand  		the availability of community care services rather than emphasize only the  		detailed nuances of nursing home reimbursement. </p>
<p>Older people strongly prefer to receive long term care services in the  		community. To date, these strong preferences have been more frequently and  		forcefully articulated in state capitols than in Washington, D.C. The Medicare  		and Social Security programs have been the primary focus of elderly advocacy  		efforts in the nation's capitol; long term care has been the top priority  		advanced in state capitols. </p>
<p>Faced with the need for long term care services for a growing elderly  		population, the preference for community based care, and constrained state  		resources, many states are seeking more affordable strategies for restructuring  		long term care financing and delivery systems. There is a sense total long term  		care costs for the elderly are destined to rise if for no other reason than the  		rapid growth of this population. Therefore, state policymakers are attempting  		to channel the growth in expenditures to services provided in the community, as  		the elderly prefer, instead of to continued expansion of nursing home beds.  		</p>
<p>Important lessons can be learned from those states which have been  		particularly successful in developing new systems of care. Their experiences  		certainly are relevant for other states designing similar community care  		systems. Private insurers also can benefit from state successes in managing  		total costs while responding to the preferences of older people for care  		provided in their homes. Federal policymakers, facing increased demands for a  		national long term care strategy, may find that the structure and operation of  		large statewide systems provide more pertinent insights than the experiences of  		individual community projects. </p>
<p>The NGA study provides an in-depth comparative analysis of six states'  		approaches to long term care system reform. Arkansas, Illinois, Maine,  		Maryland, Oregon, and Wisconsin were chosen for analysis because of their  		successful experiences in integrating multiple long term care financing and  		delivery systems. The study was not designed to formally evaluate these state  		systems; instead their characteristics were analyzed and compared to identify  		for other states a broad range of policy options which already have been  		tested. The study's findings are presented to highlight the range of decisions  		states must make in designing new approaches. Individual states can combine  		various system components to reflect their unique demographic, administrative,  		and political environments. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Major Features of State LTC Systems</h3>
<p>Community care systems for the elderly are not developed in a vacuum,  		but are designed within the context of human services delivery systems  		developed to address other concerns. In designing new long term care systems,  		states must integrate existing services for the aged, including social services  		and health. They cannot start from scratch. In order to overcome the  		fragmentation of existing service programs and make better use of the new  		resources being allocated to long term care, states are reorganizing the  		administrative responsibilities of state and local agencies. </p>
<p><b>STATE AGENCY ADMINISTRATION</b>. Three basic models of state agency  		structures have emerged to manage long term care systems. One consolidates all  		long term care responsibilities covering both institutional and community based  		care into a single, sole-purpose agency; this involves major reorganization of  		state government. The Oregon Senior Services Division manages Medicaid payments  		to nursing homes, Medicaid home and community based services waivers, the Older  		Americans Act, and state general revenue funds devoted to community care for  		the elderly. Interestingly, of the six study states, Oregon also has by far the  		largest proportion (30.1 percent) of its long term care budget going to  		community care services. Under this organizational model, all long term care  		expenditures for the elderly are consolidated into one budget, which makes  		resource allocations between community based care and institutional care a  		direct and visible trade-off. </p>
<p>A less radical model uses a human services umbrella agency structure,  		with some internal shifting of responsibilities and increased interdivision  		coordination. Arkansas, Maine, and Wisconsin use this model. </p>
<p>The third model retains independent, cabinet-level agencies for managing  		various programs, but establishes an official interagency long term care  		committee to at least keep agencies informed of each other's activities and,  		preferably, to coordinate the development of interagency policies as well.  		Illinois and Maryland use this model. </p>
<p>In all three models, the state office on aging and the Medicaid agency  		usually have been assigned primary responsibility for long term care program  		management. Given their respective traditional approaches, compromises are  		required. Aging agencies have been forced to accept some of the rigidities of  		the Medicaid program to have access to its funds. Medicaid agencies have had to  		adjust to programs which are much less standardized than hospital and nursing  		home care. </p>
<p>The organizational challenge to state governments is to integrate the  		resource allocation and policy development activities of the various state  		offices responsible for some aspect of long term care so that a coordinated  		system of care can be developed, rather than one reflecting a diffuse  		constellation of individual programs. Regardless of the organizational  		approaches adopted, the issues which must be examined across various programs  		are the same. They include: designing a single delivery system supported by  		multiple funding sources; developing eligibility criteria for individual  		programs to ensure equitable treatment of persons with similar needs and  		resources; and examining the mix of community care services supported by each  		funding stream. Ultimately, the goal of these coordinated efforts is to create  		the continuum of care which each individual program rhetorically has embraced  		but cannot by itself achieve. </p>
<p><b>LONG TERM CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS</b>. How programs are organized at  		the local level is even more important than how state responsibilities are  		organized. Older people come in direct contact with local agencies and their  		differing eligibility criteria, service packages, and funding sources. If state  		policies are successful, the elderly will have access to appropriate care  		without having to contact multiple agencies to receive services for which they  		are eligible. Therefore, most of the study states have designated a single  		local agency in each part of the state to serve as the client access point for  		receipt of all publicly financed community care programs. Centralizing entry  		helps make the system less fragmented from the perspective of older people in  		need of assistance, while helping states gain better control of total program  		costs. Client assessments, pre-admission screening programs, and case  		management are the key components of access systems for community based care  		programs. Each are present in the six study states. </p>
<p><i>Client assessments</i> for community based care focus on an older  		person's ability to conduct activities of daily living. The results are used by  		case managers to initially determine if an individual is sufficiently impaired  		to qualify for long term care programs. Most of the six states' long term care  		programs provide services only to those older persons who have impairment  		levels equivalent to those required for nursing home care. </p>
<p>The scope of <i>pre-admission screening programs</i> in the six study  		states varies substantially. One key difference is the target population group  		which must be screened--specifically, whether required participation is limited  		to Medicaid-eligible nursing home applicants or whether a broader group is  		included, such as persons who are expected to become eligible for Medicaid  		within a certain time frame after nursing home placement. Another difference is  		whether the screening process results in a binding decision on placement or is  		merely advisory. State officials note that since most older people prefer to  		stay in the community, simply having a process to discuss community care  		options helps limit nursing home entry even if it only results in an advisory  		recommendation. And, locating the screening programs in the same local agency  		which serves as the entry point for community care services increases the  		potential that clients will receive advice on all the alternatives. </p>
<p><i>Case management</i> functions are central to the entire community  		care system, especially when multiple funding sources with differing  		eligibility criteria and service providers are involved. As a result, state  		policies on the designation of case management agencies are among the most  		hotly debated long term care issues. Arkansas, Maine, and Oregon have selected  		area agencies on aging, while Wisconsin and Maryland have designated county  		social services departments. Illinois uses local agencies chosen on a  		competitive basis. </p>
<p>Specific functions assigned by the six states to case management  		agencies vary. However, general areas of responsibility include developing cost  		effective individual care plans, authorizing needed services, and following up  		to ensure needed services actually are provided. Most importantly, case  		management and assessment agencies are the only client access point for receipt  		of services financed through the major community care programs in the study  		states. States have limited the resources which case managers can spend for  		program participants; this limit either is applied to each client's care plan  		or is averaged over the case management agency's entire caseload. Usually the  		limit is tied to the cost of nursing home care. </p>
<p>The scope of services brokered through case management are fairly  		similar in the various states' long term care systems. The most commonly  		provided services are personal care, homemaker, and chore services. The  		assistance provided often includes light housekeeping, meal preparation, and  		assistance with dressing, bathing, and other aspects of personal care. By  		specific design, the states' policies allow substantial flexibility in the  		types of services which can be supported with public funds, consistent with the  		philosophy of tailoring programs to individual needs. </p>
<p><b>FINANCING OPTIONS</b>. The six study states each use a combination of  		funding sources to support community care systems, even though it would be much  		easier to use only one funding stream and thereby avoid the multiple of rules  		and restrictions accompanying each individual program. Due to these  		restrictions, particularly those associated with Medicaid, however, no single  		source is flexible or large enough to support a comprehensive long term care  		system. The three major financing sources are state general revenues, Medicaid  		home and community based services waivers, and the Medicaid optional state plan  		services of personal care services and adult day care. Each of the study states  		uses one of these as its primary funding vehicle supplemented by one or more of  		the other funding sources, along with smaller amounts of the Older Americans  		Act and the Social Services Block Grant. Wisconsin, Illinois, and Maryland  		primarily use state funds. Oregon relies chiefly on the Medicaid home and  		community based services waiver authority to support most long term care  		services. Arkansas finances its community care system by exercising the option  		to cover personal care services under the Medicaid state plan. Maine uses a  		combination of all major funding sources. </p>
<p>Each of these financing sources has advantages and disadvantages. State  		general revenues offer maximum flexibility in designing community based care  		systems. The obvious disadvantage is the lack of federal financial  		participation. All of the study states use state general revenues to some  		extent, either as the primary vehicle or as a supplement to expand the scope of  		available services, or to partially or fully subsidize care for persons who are  		not financially eligible for Medicaid. </p>
<p>The Medicaid home and community based services waiver, established as  		part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, can provide a broad  		range of non-medical long term care services. Four of the study states make  		some use of the waiver authority for providing services to the elderly, with  		Oregon using the authority most extensively. This state was the first in the  		country to be granted such a Medicaid waiver, and as a result, its program is  		substantially larger than most waivers approved in subsequent years. Waiver  		programs are viewed as a mixed blessing by the study states. The federal  		financial participation in community care programs is very appealing. Yet,  		state officials cite changing federal interpretations of program rules,  		stringent ceilings placed on the number of persons who can be served, and  		excessive administrative costs as factors limiting the usefulness of this  		financing source. </p>
<p>Section 4102 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 provides states  		with a second home and community based services waiver option that will address  		some of these problems. States using this new option will be able to increase  		the number of persons served and expenditures for Medicaid waiver services as  		long as total Medicaid long term care spending (including nursing home outlays)  		for the elderly does not increase more than a specified percentage above  		outlays for the base year. The percentage growth limit until October 1, 1989 is  		7 percent per year.<sup><font size="-1"><a href="state-long-term-care-reform-development-community-care-systems-six-states-final-report.html#note1">1</a></font></sup>  		After this date, the rate of increase is the greater of 7 percent or a formula  		to be developed measuring: the state's age seventy-five and older population  		growth, plus appropriate indices of goods and services costs facing long term  		care providers, plus a 2 percent intensity factor. This new option may be a way  		for those states with adequate base-year Medicaid outlays for total long term  		care to meet the needs of a growing population by substantially expanding  		community care while restraining the growth of institutional services. In March  		1988, Oregon submitted the first application for a waiver under this new  		authority. </p>
<p>Exercising the option to cover personal care and adult day care services  		under the Medicaid state plan is the third major option for financing state  		community based care initiatives. In contrast to waiver services, no  		extraordinary administrative requirements are imposed and no ceilings are  		placed on the number of persons who can receive services. However, since  		services are provided under the Medicaid state plan, states cannot limit this  		service to just the elderly long term care population, limit availability to  		one geographic area, or increase income eligibility thresholds to make them  		more comparable to nursing home eligibility levels. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Policy Implications</h3>
<p>The experiences of the six study states in designing large statewide  		community care programs have implications for policy development in other  		states, for the expansion of federal support for community based care systems,  		and for private insurers responding to the long term care needs of a rapidly  		expanding older market. Several observations are relevant for all three  		audiences. </p>
<p>First, all six states have expanded community based care services  		without generating runaway costs in total long term care spending. While total  		costs have risen over a five-year period, the increases are modest, averaging  		6.2 percent annually per person age seventy-five and older. (See  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/strfrm.htm/#appendI">Appendix I</a>, which analyzes long term care  		expenditure growth in each of the six states.) Fears over uncontrollable costs  		and increases in service utilization have led states, the federal government,  		and private insurers to approach expansion of community based care services  		with great caution. The experiences of the study states indicate that, even  		when community care services are a benefit under a public entitlement program,  		overall costs can be contained. Several factors help make community care  		programs affordable. limiting program eligibility to persons who have multiple  		limitations in conducting activities of daily living, using a managed care  		approach to authorize the amount and scope of services needed by individuals,  		and establishing cost sharing provisions for moderate-income persons all help  		keep program costs manageable. </p>
<p>Second, the six states have shown that some aspects of community care  		systems can be tightly structured and uniform statewide without compromising  		their ability to flexibly respond to individual service needs. Uniform  		assessment tools, explicit financial eligibility criteria, and system entry  		channeled through case management agencies have all made access to community  		care more predictable from a client's perspective and more standardized as  		viewed by program administrators. Yet, the actual services provided often are  		very loosely defined, giving local program managers considerable latitude in  		tailoring service packages to individual needs. </p>
<p>Third, non-medical supportive services form the core of state long term  		care programs. State officials note that although some limited skilled home  		nursing care may at times be provided, community based long term care services  		usually are needed by older people in response to limitations in functional  		capacity as opposed to specific medical conditions. The services needed most  		often are non-medical, in-home supports such as homemaker and personal care.  		Since federal and state officials and private insurers are much more familiar  		with skilled home health services than with these other services, there may be  		a tendency to structure supportive services in a medical context. Officials in  		the six study states believe that would be a mistake. </p>
<p>Some study findings are particularly relevant for other states. The  		experiences of the six states indicate that some state general revenues are  		essential for developing a community care system which meets the needs of low-  		and moderate-income persons. Despite exemplary state efforts to improve  		coordination and to strengthen management control and allocate resources  		wisely, rules tied to each federal funding source limit the categories of  		persons who can be served and the scope of services which can be funded. </p>
<p>Second, containing the growth of Medicaid nursing home expenditures was  		an explicit component of state strategies to expand community care in four of  		the six study states. In each case, certificate of need policy was used to  		limit the number of new beds constructed. State officials found the notion of  		"reinvesting" into community based care the savings resulting from a freeze on  		bed expansion to be a useful concept. This policy not only articulates the end  		goal of long term care system reform, but also actually reduces the rate of  		growth in Medicaid nursing home expenditures. Curtailing future institutional  		expenditures will free state resources to expand community based care. </p>
<p>Third, each of the six states developed their systems incrementally.  		Three of them (Maryland, Wisconsin, and Oregon) phased in statewide  		implementation of long term care initiatives by geographic area. All added  		various program components over a period of several years. For example,  		pre-admission screening programs often were added after the supply of community  		care services was expanded, enabling screening program staff to offer persons  		seeking nursing home placement some viable community service options. However,  		since the various components of community care systems all interrelate,  		undertaking a comprehensive planning process before major new initiatives are  		underway makes it easier to add new elements in the future. </p>
<p>The study states found that a broad planning effort achieves other  		objectives. It helps get multiple agencies and organizations committed to the  		success of long term care initiatives and fosters consensus on policy goals and  		objectives. This lays a positive framework for resolving more difficult  		operational conflicts in the future. Membership organizations of older people  		often were active participants in state planning processes. Generally they did  		not press for overly ambitions proposals but rather understood state fiscal  		limits and worked within them. A consistent concern of these groups in all  		states but Wisconsin was designing a system which was not identified as being  		part of the "welfare system." This orientation affected their preferences for  		the selection of lead management agencies at the state and local level, but did  		not preclude support for client cost sharing policies and other mechanisms to  		maximize allocation of available state resources to persons with the least  		ability to pay. </p>
<p>Other study findings are especially pertinent for the development of  		federal financing policies for community based long term care. First, one of  		the most difficult tasks faced by the six study states was linking together  		separate systems for social services, aging programs, and health care delivery.  		Decisions had to be made concerning the best local agencies to perform case  		management, assessment, and direct service delivery. In addition, states had to  		decide how to expand the capacity of the delivery system to provide an  		increased supply of services. Sometimes new provider agencies were created,  		other times new types of services were developed which previously were not  		available, and frequently existing agencies took on new responsibilities. State  		activities to build the capacity of local delivery systems necessarily varied  		with state circumstances. If federal long term care initiatives are to relate  		to existing state human services delivery systems, states are in a unique  		position to design approaches that will best build upon the existing  		infrastructure. </p>
<p>Second, where possible the six study states preferred to hold local long  		term care systems accountable for end results rather than trying to control  		every detail of local administration. This approach recognizes differences  		among communities in local practices and traditions and avoids emphasizing  		process requirements. As more states adopt new community care programs,  		diversity among states will increase. This model of accountability used by the  		study states will be appropriate for federal/state relationships in any new  		federal community care initiative. </p>
<p>Finally, the six study states have demonstrated to private insurers and  		other public payers that it is feasible to provide multiple community care  		services (not traditionally covered by health insurance) if there is a  		systematic process for assessing client needs, authorizing a package of  		services, and coordinating multiple providers. Case management systems can  		perform such functions and allow private or social insurance plans to expand  		the services covered under long term care policies to include various social  		supports which are more affordable than medical services traditionally covered  		by insurance policies. Insurers have been reluctant to offer these services,  		which typically have low unit costs, in part because they view the  		administrative costs to be disproportionately high. In addition, insurers are  		concerned about uncontrollably high utilization rates since they expect older  		people to actively seek these services while going to great lengths to avoid  		nursing home placement. The six study states had similar concerns when their  		programs began but found that improved assessment techniques can effectively  		limit the eligible population and that case management structures can allocate  		services to individual clients within overall budget limits. </p>
