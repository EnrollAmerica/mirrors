<p>Post-acute care (PAC) refers to care received after an acute  		hospitalization, which is typically provided in skilled nursing facilities  		(SNFs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), home health (HH) agencies,  		and/or outpatient (OP) rehabilitation settings. In 2002, approximately  		one-third of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from hospitals utilized some  		form of PAC within one day of leaving the hospital. Although care received in  		different PAC settings varies to some extent, many experts believe that  		patients with similar care needs may be treated in different PAC settings and  		that the choice of discharge destination is often driven by factors other than  		patient characteristics (e.g., availability of beds, physician or family  		preference, practice patterns).</p>
<p>In an effort to contain rapid growth in Medicare PAC expenditures during  		the late 1980s to mid-1990s, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997  		that required the development and implementation of prospective payment systems  		(PPS) for all types of PAC. The PPSs have been phased in over the past eight  		years, beginning with SNFs in July 1998, followed by OP hospital care in August  		2000, HH agencies in October 2000, and IRFs in January 2002.</p>
<p>This study, funded by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  		and Evaluation, had three primary aims, including:</p>
<p>1) To compare quality, outcomes, and costs of PAC episodes involving  		single and multiple-providers (e.g., IRF care followed by HH care, IRF care  		followed by OP care) provided to Medicare beneficiaries with stroke after PPS  		implementation.</p>
<p>Using stroke as a tracer condition, this study examined PAC outcomes and  		costs for single and multiple-provider episodes of care. Outcomes studied  		included return to community residence, functional outcomes (including  		activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living  		(IADLs), social/role function, and function related to walking), self-reported  		health, and satisfaction. Costs included cost to the Medicare program and to  		beneficiaries. Few prior studies have examined outcomes and costs of  		multiple-provider episodes, particularly those involving OP rehabilitation  		care, and no major studies have been conducted subsequent to PPS implementation  		in all PAC settings. This study, therefore, represents a unique opportunity to  		explore these various facets of PAC during the post-PPS era.</p>
<p>2) To compare and contrast various quality of care and outcome measures  		that can be used across PAC settings.</p>
<p>This study explored whether a core set of measures can be identified  		that captures outcomes and quality of PAC episodes involving both single and  		multiple-providers. Given the current policy interest in uniform assessment for  		quality monitoring and comparing outcomes across settings, this research  		provides invaluable information in moving toward this goal.</p>
<p>3) To examine the effect of PPS implementation on patterns of PAC  		utilization (including IRF, SNF, and HH agency) for stroke patients.</p>
<p>This objective involved analysis of national claims data to complement  		the in-depth primary data analysis conducted for the first objective. Recent  		research on the use of IRF care before and after the implementation of the IRF  		PPS was conducted by RAND; however, this work was limited to only the early  		stages of the IRF PPS (the first year of IRF PPS implementation). No studies to  		date have assessed the effects of PPS in terms of PAC utilization and patterns  		of care following PPS implementation in all PAC settings. Given the financial  		incentives that exist under the different PPSs, PAC utilization patterns are  		likely to be altered, with the potential to influence cost and quality of  		care.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Methods</h3>
<p>This study of PAC included a national sample of 88 PAC providers  		comprised of 35 IRFs, 33 SNFs, and 20 HH agencies in 20 states. Subject  		eligibility was limited to Medicare beneficiaries admitted to PAC from the  		hospital for an acute stroke, who were at least 65 years of age and enrolled in  		the Medicare fee-for-service program rather than managed care. Excluded were  		individuals who were comatose, those residing in a long-term care facility  		prior to this stroke, and those without a proxy if cognitively impaired or with  		severe speech/language impairment. The sample included a total of 674 subjects  		enrolled between late 2002 and early 2005: 555 whose first admission was to  		IRF, 62 whose first admission was to SNF, and 57 whose initial admission was to  		HH.</p>
<p>Patient characteristics analyzed in the study included demographics, and  		pre-stroke condition in available supports, function, and global health rating.  		Acute stroke characteristics included stroke characteristics and comorbidities.  		At the time of admission to PAC, the assessment included cognition, visual  		neglect, speech/language, function, and depression. Cognition and depression  		were assessed by direct interview with the patient (or proxy), whereas PAC  		admission function was obtained from the Minimum Data Set for SNFs, the  		Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument for IRFs, and  		the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for HH agencies. In  		addition, a range of facility characteristics and community characteristics  		were collected.</p>
<p>Outcome and quality measures included: location at 90 days; functional  		recovery in four domains; recovery in self-rated overall health; and  		patient/proxy satisfaction. Location measures examined both nursing home vs.  		community residence and whether the 90-day residence was an equally independent  		living situation to the setting prior to the stroke. The functional recovery  		measures included the domains of ADLs, IADLs, ambulation, and social/role  		function. Function was assessed for multiple activities within each of these  		domains by an on-site data collector by interview for the baseline period prior  		to stroke, and by telephone for the 90-day follow-up.</p>
<p>Cost analyses included the costs to Medicare and to beneficiaries for  		all types of care. These costs were obtained from Part A and Part B claims  		data. Utilization data were obtained from Medicare claims for services covered  		by Medicare.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Results</h3>
<p><b>Patterns of Post-Acute Care:</b></p>
<ul><li>Nearly 170 different PAC patterns were identified in 90 days.</li>
<li>Volume of direct stroke admissions from the hospital for Medicare  		  patients not enrolled in managed care decreased markedly in both SNFs and HH  		  agencies from the period prior to PPS.</li>
<li>Patterns were predominately multiple-provider episodes beginning with  		  IRF. Length of initial IRF stays decreased by two days between 2003 and  		  2004.</li>
<li>Sixty percent of IRF admissions used a second PAC provider and 30  		  percent used three or more in 90 days.</li>
<li>About a third of direct admissions to SNFs used a second PAC provider  		  after the SNF and 29 percent used three or more in 90 days.</li>
<li>Only 20 percent of direct admissions to HH agencies used a subsequent  		  PAC provider in 90 days.</li>
</ul><p><b>Patient Characteristics:</b></p>
<ul><li>SNF patients were the most disabled prior to the stroke; most  		  cognitively and physically impaired following their stroke; and had the  		  greatest speech/language impairments and symptoms of depression after their  		  stroke.</li>
<li>On the other end of the spectrum, HH patients were more functional  		  with less cognitive impairment than IRF patients, although they were more  		  similar to IRF patients than SNF patients.</li>
<li>Among patients admitted directly to IRF, IRF to SNF  		  (IRF&gt;SNF) patients had the greatest cognitive impairment, visual  		  impairment, speech/language impairment, and functional impairment upon  		  admission to PAC. Their characteristics were similar to the patients discharged  		  directly from acute hospital to SNF.</li>
<li>Patients admitted to HH from IRF were similar to patients admitted to  		  OP from IRF with respect to pre-morbid status, cognition, and most functional  		  measures following their stroke, but they had lower incomes.</li>
</ul><p><b>Outcomes:</b></p>
<ul><li>Descriptive outcomes for all patients admitted to IRF, HH, or SNF  		  followed the patterns one would expect based on patient characteristics: the  		  best recovery of function occurred among HH patients, the worst recovery  		  occurred among SNF patients, and IRF patients were in the middle. Due to the  		  differentiation in patient characteristics based on initial provider setting,  		  it was not feasible to equitably compare outcomes for all patients.</li>
<li>IRF&gt;SNF patients had comparable outcomes to patients  		  discharged directly to SNF in 90-day residence and in functional recovery.  		  Satisfaction appeared to differ between these two options, with greater  		  satisfaction in terms of goals and progress in the IRF&gt;SNF group, and  		  greater satisfaction with discharge preparation and family preparation in the  		  direct SNF group.</li>
<li>Relative to patients discharged to HH following IRF, outcomes for  		  patients admitted to OP care following IRF were comparable with respect to  		  90-day residence and significantly better in two dimensions of functional  		  recovery, even after risk adjustment.</li>
</ul><p><b>Costs and Service Utilization:</b></p>
<ul><li>Descriptive cost comparisons among direct discharges to IRF, SNF, and  		  HH followed the patterns one would expect based on reimbursement systems. Costs  		  of care for stroke patients discharged directly to IRFs were generally twice as  		  high as cost for SNF patients in the PAC episode and eight times as high as  		  costs for HH patients for PAC services during 90 days.</li>
<li>Relative to direct discharges to SNF, PAC costs for IRF&gt;SNF  		  patients were three times higher, and 90-day costs for IRF&gt;SNF  		  patients were twice as high. Total PAC length of stay for the IRF&gt;SNF  		  group was about 73 days in contrast to 46 days for the SNF group.</li>
<li>Relative to IRF&gt;OP costs, total cost per PAC episode was  		  $2,200 higher and total cost per 90 days was $5,200 higher for IRF&gt;HH  		  patients. Despite the lower costs, IRF&gt;OP patients received about 40  		  therapy visits in contrast to 21 therapy visits for IRF&gt;HH patients in  		  PAC episodes with comparable duration. However, average PAC beneficiary costs  		  were $400 higher for the IRF&gt;OP group.</li>
<li>The 90-day costs were also comparable between IRF&gt;OP  		  patients and IRF patients who were discharged to a residence because the latter  		  group required more acute and additional PAC services after they were  		  discharged to the community and the initial PAC episode was complete.</li>
</ul><p><b>National Trends:</b></p>
<ul><li>Admissions of stroke patients to SNFs directly from hospital have  		  been steadily declining since 1998, and admissions to IRFs and acute long-term  		  care hospitals have been increasing.</li>
<li>The number of high-volume SNFs and IRFs is declining, with patients  		  more evenly distributed among providers.</li>
<li>Even basic characteristics, such as age, differed significantly  		  between SNF and all IRF patients. However, the 25 percent of IRF discharges who  		  received care in SNF following IRF have characteristic similar to patients who  		  went directly to SNF.</li>
<li>Length of stay significantly declined in IRFs and also freestanding  		  SNFs since PPS was implemented.</li>
</ul><p><b>Measures:</b></p>
<ul><li>A core group of self/proxy-reported functional measures exist that  		  address different dimensions of function and are useful for comparing outcomes  		  across both single and multiple-provider episodes.</li>
<li>These measures are hierarchical in terms of how stroke patients  		  recover function.</li>
<li>Location at 90 days and return to an equally independent setting were  		  also valid global outcomes for PAC.</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Policy Implications</h3>
<p>Declining lengths of stay in the IRF setting and discharge to subsequent  		PAC providers, resulting in multiple-provider episodes, are natural  		consequences of the IRF per discharge PPS. That is, the incentive exists to  		admit patients to IRF, contain costs with a shorter stay in the IRF, and then  		discharge patients to a second type of PAC provider, which could be a SNF, HH  		agency, or OP care. This response is similar to declining acute hospital  		lengths of stay and the increased use of IRF, SNF, and HH care following the  		implementation of the per discharge acute hospital PPS. As per discharge  		payments for IRF care are readjusted based on length of stay trends, savings in  		IRF payments may help to offset the costs of the additional care in subsequent  		providers. However, the impact on quality of care, outcomes, and costs as a  		result of this discontinuity is important to monitor.</p>
<p>For the diagnosis of stroke, the increased use of IRFs and decline in  		use of SNFs immediately following the hospitalization suggests that IRFs have  		an increasing incentive to admit stroke patients under PPS, which may be  		accompanied by a decreased incentive in SNFs for admitting stroke patients.  		This could occur because payment rates for stroke patients in IRFs are among  		the most profitable based on the case mix groups and because other policies  		such as the 75 percent rule may encourage IRFs to admit patients with diagnoses  		such as stroke. SNFs may have difficulty covering the costs of the therapy  		services for stroke patients requiring substantial rehabilitation (which is the  		case for many stroke patients discharged directly from the hospital). Because  		the highest Resource Utilization Group rehabilitation category includes  		patients with 12 hours of therapy per week, and under PPS SNFs have no  		incentive to provide more than 12 hours of therapy per week, patients requiring  		more therapy are likely to be admitted to IRFs. </p>
<p>The HH PPS includes a substantial payment rate increase if ten therapy  		visits are provided; however, there is no payment incentive to admit patients  		who require any more than ten therapy visits. In combination, the PPS could  		result in greater differences in the patients admitted to each PAC provider  		from the hospital because of their need for and ability to tolerate  		therapy.</p>
<p>For the subgroup of stroke patients discharged to IRF and subsequently a  		SNF (about 25 percent of discharges to IRF from hospital), substitution with  		patients discharged directly to SNFs appears to exist. The major difference was  		that the IRF&gt;SNF episodes were almost twice as likely in communities  		with high IRF use rates and occurred more frequently in urban areas, suggesting  		differences in practice patterns. Overall, 60 percent of these patients had  		cognitive impairment, 75 percent had significant functional impairment, and 25  		percent met strict criteria for depression. Nevertheless, outcomes were  		comparable between the IRF&gt;SNF group and those admitted directly to  		SNFs, whereas costs were 2-3 times higher for IRF&gt;SNF patients. From a  		policy perspective, if these individuals can be identified upon acute hospital  		discharge, then direct discharge to SNF would be more cost-effective. One way  		to encourage more cost-effective care would be to pay IRFs at a reduced payment  		rate equivalent to the SNF level of care for IRF days in cases when the patient  		is ultimately discharged to a SNF. A similar policy is currently in place  		whereby Medicare pays IRFs a lower rate for patients with stays of less than  		four days. Under this scenario, even if patients were to receive a very brief  		trial of rehabilitation in an IRF, as soon as it is apparent they require  		longer term, less intense rehabilitation, they would be discharged to a  		SNF.</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of OP services subsequent to IRF care was very  		apparent in this study. Stroke patients who received OP care subsequent to an  		IRF stay had better outcomes, received more therapy visits, and at lower cost  		to Medicare relative to patients discharged to HH agencies subsequent to an IRF  		stay. The comparability between these HH patients and OP patients raises  		questions about why some patients are considered "homebound" and others are  		not. While most of the patients receiving more HH or OP care following IRF may  		meet the relatively loose definition of "homebound," OP services were more  		likely to be used by stroke patients with higher incomes. Not surprisingly, the  		IRF&gt;OP pattern resulted in higher beneficiary costs because of the  		larger coinsurance. Reducing the cost to beneficiaries by reducing the OP  		coinsurance might increase the utilization of OP services relative to home care  		services following the IRF stay, which would be offset by fewer patients using  		higher cost HH services. Even if more patients in total were to use OP services  		(i.e., those previously discharged home with no further care), total cost would  		not be impacted for such patients due to the costs of Medicare services  		(increased hospitalizations and subsequent PAC services) that would have been  		needed by these patients if they had not received OP care. The difficulty in  		paying the coinsurance associated with OP service and the potential lack of  		reliable transportation may encourage people to use the more expensive HH care  		rather than OP services. From a policy perspective, we need to begin to  		recognize the important role of OP care in PAC used either immediately  		following the acute stay or subsequent to other PAC providers. It may offer the  		most cost-effective benefit for patients in many circumstances. </p>
<p>A uniform set of core measures is required to assess PAC outcomes for  		patients admitted to single or multiple PAC settings. The current  		setting-specific assessment tools cannot be used for this purpose because they  		use different elements, only some of which can be cross-walked, and have  		different follow-up intervals, making it impossible to compare change over  		fixed time periods. For outcome measurement, a baseline time point and a fixed  		follow-up point are required, regardless of the number of PAC providers that  		are utilized by a patient. An ideal baseline is pre-morbid function so that one  		can determine the extent to which prior function was recovered, and 90 days  		represents a follow-up point at which most PAC is completed. Functional  		measures across a range of domains, such as ADL, IADL, ambulation, and  		social/role function, are critical to assess because they are unique functional  		dimensions that recover at different rates. Changes in residence and global  		health ratings from baseline to 90 days are excellent general markers of  		rehabilitation success.</p>
<p>From this national study of PAC prospective payment between late 2002  		and early 2005, we observed major changes in patterns of PAC utilization for  		stroke patients. Overall, providers were strongly responding to the PPS  		incentives. Substitution between patients directly discharged to SNFs and those  		discharged to SNF following IRF, and between patients discharged to OP  		following IRF and discharged to HH following IRF, showed that  		cost-effectiveness of PAC may be improved through changes in incentives.  		Continued collection of uniform outcome and cost data is essential if we intend  		to maximize opportunities for improving PAC provided to Medicare  		beneficiaries.</p>
