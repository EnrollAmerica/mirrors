<h2>Purpose of the Report</h2>
<p>This is the final report of a project that assesses the need for  		developing and fielding another national disability survey data collection  		effort. It presents the findings from three principal project activities  		designed to assess whether existing data are sufficient to answer key  		disability-related research questions identified by the staffs of various  		federal agencies, and options for addressing the unanswered questions,  		including the pursuit of a national disability survey. These activities  		include:</p>
<ul><li>Obtaining feedback from federal and state agencies regarding their  		  disability data needs and unanswered questions, </li>
<li>Reviewing the disability-related information that is available in 40  		  existing national surveys, and</li>
<li>Obtaining ideas and feedback from experts on disability data and  		  research regarding how to address existing limitations in national disability  		  data. </li>
</ul><p>The summary provided in this report includes a review of existing  		disability data collection efforts and their limitations, and discusses a wide  		range of potential options to address these limitations. While the general  		purpose of the project is to assess the need for a national disability survey,  		we do not offer conclusions or recommendations regarding whether a national  		disability survey is warranted and if so, what its specific nature should be.  		Rather, this report provides objective information intended to be a resource  		for staff of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other  		federal agencies to inform their discussions and consideration of options for  		addressing their disability-related data needs, including the decision whether  		to conduct a new national disability survey. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Current State of Disability Data</h2>
<p><b>Review of Existing National Surveys</b>. Key findings from a review  		of 40 national surveys include the following: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The specific measures of disability and wording of questions  			 designed to elicit information about a particular type of disability (for  			 example, visual impairment), differ markedly across surveys. Nearly all of the  			 national surveys reviewed have questions that can be used to identify people  			 with disabilities, but a few do not. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The National Health Interview survey (NHIS) and Survey of Income and  			 Program Participation (SIPP) are frequently used to address disability-related  			 issues because they contain a relatively large amount of disability content,  			 are representative of the national household population, and include large  			 samples of people with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A concerted effort is being made to use a uniform set of disability  			 indicators across surveys. The six-question series included in the American  			 Community Survey (ACS), Current Population Survey (CPS), American Housing  			 Survey (AHS), and NHIS supplement is part of this effort. A new supplement in  			 the 2011 NHIS, which will include a battery of questions related to disability,  			 represents an effort to make more uniform, descriptive information on  			 disability available across countries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Few surveys contain measures to specifically identify individuals  			 with cognitive or intellectual disabilities. Measures to identify specific  			 health conditions underlying disability also are uncommon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are numerous surveys of specific subpopulations (for example,  			 students, inmates, nursing home residents, and beneficiaries of specific  			 programs) on a variety of disability-related topics. This likely reflects the  			 specific data and information needs of particular agencies and the fact that  			 the general population surveys do not contain large enough samples of  			 individuals in these specific target populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many national surveys have longitudinal components, though most  			 cover a specific subgroup rather than a general population. The Panel Survey of  			 Income Dynamics and Health and Retirement Study represent the most extensive  			 efforts in that they regularly interview individuals from the time of sampling  			 until death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New disability supplements to the SIPP and CPS will increase the  			 information available on employment, economic well-being, and program  			 participation. Two new longitudinal surveys are also in the works. The National  			 Longitudinal Transition Survey 2012 will provide new longitudinal information  			 on transitions from school to work, and the National Health and Aging Trends  			 Study will monitor changes in daily life and activities throughout the aging  			 process of Medicare beneficiaries over age 65.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumption, finances, expenditures, transportation, environmental  			 barriers, accommodations, and community supports are the general topic areas  			 least commonly addressed for people with disabilities in the surveys we  			 reviewed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative data have been linked with several of the national  			 surveys. The most frequently linked administrative data sources are from Social  			 Security and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) programs, which  			 have been linked with several health-focused national surveys.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A final key observation is that a considerable amount of survey data is  		already being collected on disability issues and populations. Finding ways to  		improve, augment, and coordinate these existing mechanisms is an important  		means for addressing the limitations of survey data on disability-related  		issues and populations.</p>
<p><b>Disability Data Limitations</b>. A number of limitations of existing  		disability data were identified by state and federal agency staff, Technical  		Advisory Group (TAG) members, and through our review of national surveys.  		Principal among these include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Disability measurement is inadequate. The health and functional  			 measures used to identify people with disabilities vary markedly in concept,  			 detail, and quality across surveys. Except for the surveys that focus on  			 health, most do not capture in-depth information on the health issues and  			 functional limitations experienced by people with disabilities. Measures  			 corresponding to mental, emotional, cognitive, and intellectual disabilities  			 were identified as being particularly poor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sample sizes are small. Small numbers of people with disabilities in  			 the large, general population surveys limit the ability to examine subgroups of  			 people with disabilities. Analysis of residents of specific regions, states, or  			 substate geographic areas is also limited due to small sample sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative data are inaccessible. Administrative data are often  			 hard to access due to legal, privacy, and security concerns, and data-sharing  			 agreements are sometimes difficult to obtain. Linking the data across sources  			 is also problematic because of technical issues and resource  			 constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality is poor for some data. Respondent reports of program  			 participation are believed to be inaccurate. Proxy responses and stigma related  			 to disability also might contribute to poor data quality. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disability topics are inadequately addressed. Topics believed to be  			 inadequately addressed include: disability onset and dynamics; program  			 participation and the adequacy of support; supports needed to live in the  			 community and environmental barriers to community participation; supports  			 needed to obtain and maintain employment; disability-related expenditures; and  			 health care access among employed people with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data are not timely. Many sources of disability-related data are old  			 or are produced very infrequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is inadequate longitudinal data. Existing longitudinal data  			 fail to reasonably identify persons with disabilities and do not provide a  			 lifetime perspective on disability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<h2>Incremental Options for Addressing Disability Data Limitations</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways that existing disability data collection  		efforts could be strengthened to address data gaps and limitations. Here, we  		describe a variety of strategies that build on existing data collection  		efforts, and thus, might be considered incremental in nature. </p>
<p><b>Increase Awareness of Existing Data</b>. The perception of several  		TAG members was that a lot of good disability-related data exists, but that  		knowledge and use of some data sources are limited. Improving available  		information about existing data and making it easier for federal and state  		agency staff to access it is one potential way disability data limitations  		might be addressed. Reports that summarize a great deal of information in a  		format that is easily accessible, are one way this can occur and periodic  		cross-agency panels or work groups that exchange information about the nature  		and limitations of disability data are another. </p>
<p><b>Improve Disability Measures in National Surveys</b>. Although  		disability is a difficult concept to define and measure, efforts to develop a  		succinct but comprehensive set of questions to identify people with  		disabilities have great potential value. Such efforts led to a six-question  		series developed by an interagency work group, which is becoming the new  		standard for identifying disability in national surveys. Despite the  		considerable efforts to develop these questions, however, they appear to not  		capture a significant number of people. Though not without its limitations, the  		addition of the six common questions across surveys was viewed as an important  		first step. While supportive of efforts to use a common set of disability  		questions, TAG and Federal Advisory Expert Panel (FAEP) members believed that  		complementary efforts were important and needed to be pursued. These include:  		preserving the ability to produce trends by at least temporarily including old  		disability questions when new questions are added; conducting research to  		better understand who is being captured by the six-question disability series;  		and strategically adding disability questions to selected surveys that will  		provide information to inform the findings from other surveys that do not  		include the additional questions.</p>
<p><b>Facilitate Increased Use of Administrative Data</b>. There are many  		possibilities for enhancing the use of administrative data. Several appealing  		options include the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Maintain and strengthen efforts to link survey and administrative  			 data. Survey and administrative data linkages currently exist for many national  			 surveys, and additional efforts in this area are an important way to address  			 many disability data limitations. An example of a new effort would be to  			 develop a match between the ACS and Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid  			 data. Improving the match rates in the survey-administrative data links  			 conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is another means  			 of strengthening such efforts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain and strengthen efforts to match administrative data across  			 agencies. Cross-program data linkages would be useful for developing a better  			 understanding of how the target populations of programs overlap and the extent  			 to which service needs are met or are duplicative. Many interagency data use  			 agreements are already in place; developing more of these and creating  			 multilateral agreements would expand access to administrative data. Creating a  			 stand-alone data workroom is another possibility. The workroom would provide  			 access to data without personal identifiers that are linkable to data from  			 numerous program sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make greater use of Unemployment Insurance (UI) records. Employment  			 and earnings information collected by states for the UI program are reported  			 quarterly and, as such, represent the most frequent and consistently collected  			 administrative data source on employment and earnings. Developing linkages to  			 federal administrative data or survey data and making the UI data accessible  			 for more research purposes would address some of the disability data  			 limitations surrounding the issue of employment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop the capacity to use electronic health records. The emerging  			 use of electronic health records offers future opportunities to use these data  			 on their own or to supplement other data for disability research and policy  			 purposes, but work needs to begin now to facilitate this. Of particular  			 importance is developing a standard set of items that measure disability and  			 functioning. Social Securitys current efforts to identify people with  			 disabilities who meet their programs disability criteria from such  			 records might provide a good foundation for a broader effort to develop  			 measures of disability and functioning from such records. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve general accessibility. Greater accessibility could be  			 achieved through improved documentation, technical assistance, and the creation  			 of variables that are useful for research as opposed to program administration  			 purposes. Access also could be facilitated through the use of a contractor to  			 administer data use agreements (under a model similar to that used by the  			 CMSs Research Data and Assistance Center). </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Improve Collection of Longitudinal Information</b>. Options for  		improving longitudinal data include collecting such information using event  		history calendars or diaries, and asking retrospective questions (for example,  		about key events surrounding disability onset). Improving the ability to  		efficiently measure and interpret changes in disability status over time might  		also lead to disability questions being added to existing longitudinal surveys.  		New or enhanced longitudinal survey efforts could also provide information on  		other unanswered disability-related questions. A new effort could sample people  		who apply to a program and who exit from the same programs. A more ambitious  		approach would be to develop a longitudinal disability sample. The SIPP could  		be used to identify respondents with disabilities and these respondents could  		be followed for an extended period (for example, 10 years). </p>
<p><b>Enhance Disability-Related Content in Existing Surveys</b>. Inclusion  		of a basic set of disability questions in all surveys is the most important way  		disability-relevant content in national surveys could be improved. Among  		surveys that already include questions to identify people with disabilities,  		FAEP and TAG members believed it would be useful to add content related to:  		disability severity and onset, program participation and service use, barriers  		to independent living, work accommodations, accessible public transportation,  		assistive technology, disability-related costs, and the emotional and social  		impacts of disability. </p>
<p><b>Augment Samples in Existing Surveys</b>. There are several possible  		ways to augment survey samples and address issues related to small sample sizes  		of people with disabilities: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Pool data across survey years. This is a useful means for increasing  			 sample sizes when data have been collected consistently over time. The Medical  			 Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), NHIS, CPS, and SIPP are good candidates for  			 pooling multiples years to increase sample sizes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify survey sample frames and methods to identify more people with  			 disabilities in surveys. The exclusion of people residing in group quarters or  			 institutions may inadvertently omit a large number of people with disabilities.  			 Improvements in the manner with which surveys interview respondents might also  			 help to identify more people with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purposefully augment existing survey samples with individuals in the  			 subpopulation of interest. An example is Social Securitys collaboration  			 with the Census Bureau to include an additional sample of Social Security  			 disability beneficiaries in the 2001 SIPP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The addition of the six-question disability series to federal  			 surveys might also offer future opportunities to augment sample sizes in  			 surveys that obtain their samples from larger national surveys. The screener  			 questions from the parent survey could be used to augment samples of people  			 with disabilities in the supplemental survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oversample from identifiable groups with high disability prevalence.  			 The SIPP used this approach to oversample low-income households. For example,  			 use ACS data pooled across years to identify small geographic areas where  			 disability prevalence is relatively high, and then oversample those areas for  			 the SIPP or NHIS. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Field Periodic Supplements</b>. Adding a topical supplement to an  		existing national survey is a useful approach when a large amount of new  		information is required or when there is a need to study a specific  		subpopulation that cannot be easily identified with existing information. An  		existing, large national survey would act as the screener and this  		parent survey would also provide additional information that  		enhances the supplement. Three general models for fielding topical supplements  		to existing surveys are currently used and offer models for adding  		disability-related content: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Topical modules are supplementary questionnaires administered during  			 a longitudinal survey that contains information on other topics, such as  			 employment. The planned disability supplement to the CPS is an  			 example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topical question batteries are sets of questions that can be added  			 to a core survey questionnaire but, unlike topical modules, are only asked of a  			 subsample. An example of this is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance  			 System, where topical supplements can be used in concert with the core national  			 survey and administered in a single interview. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topical surveys appear to be stand-alone surveys, but in fact derive  			 their samples from a parent survey and so are essentially extensive topical  			 modules of the parent survey. For example, the MEPS sample is derived from the  			 NHIS. The supplemental interviews are conducted separately from the original  			 interviews but the data from the original survey can be combined and used with  			 the topical survey data. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Conduct Periodic Surveys of Subpopulations</b>. Over half of the 40  		surveys reviewed for this report represent surveys of subpopulations. The need  		for these types of surveys is driven by the specific information needs of  		particular agencies and the inability of general population surveys to identify  		or include in their samples sufficient numbers of individuals for which  		disability information is needed. Most subpopulation surveys focus on those  		already in a subpopulation, rather than those transitioning into or out of the  		subpopulation, such as applicants. Hence, adding special surveys that start  		with transitioning populations might be of considerable value (for example,  		transitions from education to employment, changes in residences, or from  		institutional to and from noninstitutionalsettings, entry to and exit from  		public programs, and across changes in health care systems). </p>
<p><b>Designate a Lead Agency or Group to Coordinate Disability Data  		Efforts</b>. Designating a lead organization or agency to advocate for and  		coordinate disability data improvements efforts was perceived to be necessary.  		Proposed organizations include the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation, the NCHS, the Office of Management and Budget, and the  		National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Addressing Disability Data Limitations with a National Disability  		Survey</h2>
<p>Another approach to addressing the disability data limitations would be  		to design and conduct a national survey focused specifically on disability  		issues and populations. Pursuing such an option might be desirable if: pursuit  		of other, more incremental options are infeasible or do not adequately address  		the disability data limitations considered to be of significance to federal  		agencies; there is a desire to collect a large amount and wide variety of data;  		and there is a goal to make disability issues more prominent and to establish  		and ongoing mechanism for periodically and consistently collecting data to  		assess the experiences and economic well-being of people with disabilities.  		Potential features of such a survey include the following:</p>
<p><b>Purpose</b>. There are many different data limitations a national  		disability survey could be designed to address and the primary purpose of the  		survey will dictate its design features. Potential purposes include: providing  		a broad range of detailed information about disability and acting as the gold  		standard for general population prevalence and disability measurement; focusing  		on a subgroup neglected in other surveys; providing important  		disability-related information not captured in existing surveys; and ensuring  		periodic and consistent collection of key information on people with  		disabilities.</p>
<p><b>Stand-alone versus Supplement</b>. A basic decision to be made with  		regard to conducting a national disability survey is the choice to establish a  		stand-alone survey or create a supplement to an existing survey. The only  		national disability survey ever conducted in the United States, the National  		Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D), was a supplement to an existing  		survey. Relative to a stand-alone survey, this approach imposes lower costs and  		burden and has the benefit of providing comparison data for people without  		disabilities at no additional cost. However, deriving a sample from an existing  		survey imposes the sampling and administration methods on the new survey. A  		stand-alone survey offers the opportunity to tailor sampling and administration  		methods to better capture people with disabilities who may be excluded from  		existing surveys. </p>
<p><b>Frequency of Administration</b>. Ideally, data collection would occur  		frequently, perhaps annually or biennially, which would allow for an analysis  		of trends and short-term changes in the experiences of people with  		disabilities. An alternative model would be to administer a core set of  		questions on a regular basis with a more comprehensive disability survey  		occurring less frequently (for example, every 5-10 years). </p>
<p><b>Population Coverage and Level of Estimates</b>. A national disability  		survey provides the opportunity to improve on data limitations related to the  		population sampled. Possible opportunities to improve or modify data collection  		in this respect include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Sample all Americans, including people who reside in the community,  			 group quarters, and institutions, as well as those who are homeless. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve coverage of people with disabilities and their families.  			 Such information might be important in understanding the support system  			 available to respondents with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include all age groups and disability questions that are appropriate  			 for different ages. The inclusion of all age groups in one survey would be  			 important to a national disability survey intended to provide information on  			 disability across the life cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oversample or create new surveys focused on disability  			 subpopulations neglected in other surveys. This could include people making  			 transitions, racial and ethnic minorities, people with rare disabling  			 conditions, and employment subgroups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a survey with a sample size large enough to produce state or  			 local-level estimates. This will assist states in obtaining basic prevalence  			 rates, assessing access to and unmet need for services, and understanding the  			 impacts of state-level policies and programmatic changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on communities as the unit of observation. A focus on  			 communities, rather than on individual experiences and perspectives, might be  			 valuable for purposes of gathering information about the community environment,  			 including supports for people with disabilities and how the environment affects  			 outcomes for individual consumers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Longitudinal Data</b>. A longitudinal survey can address  		disability-related issues that cannot be addressed by other means (for example,  		capturing information about the dynamics of disability and the characteristics  		and outcomes of key transitions). Longitudinal information about working-age  		people with disabilities is particularly scarce. In collecting longitudinal  		data, panel length and survey frequency must be balanced against financial  		costs and the risk of sample attrition. Alternative methods to collecting  		longitudinal data include the use of retrospective questions and linkages with  		administrative data. </p>
<p><b>Disability Measures</b>. A national disability survey could address  		problems with the inconsistency and quality of disability measures. A step to  		ensure consistency across other surveys measuring disability is to include the  		six-question series used to identify disability in the ACS, AHS, and CPS, which  		appears to be the new standard for identifying disability. Including other  		measures of disability as well would allow for a better understanding of which  		individuals are being identified and overlooked by the six-question series. A  		battery of more detailed questions to measure onset, severity, functioning,  		underlying causes of disability, and use of accommodations and supports could  		also be included. Short general health scales, such as the SF-12 and more  		detailed SF-36, might also be included to assess how these scales operate in  		the context of disability.</p>
<p><b>Topical Content</b>. A national disability survey could potentially  		cover a wide variety of general topics, including health, health care,  		education, employment, program participation, participation in an array of  		social activities, housing, disability services, supports, and quality of life.  		A new data collection effort could also address disability-specific topic  		areas, such as the role of the surrounding environment and transitions in and  		out of federal disability programs. Finally, a national disability survey could  		reach beyond a cursory level of understanding to know more about the motivation  		behind outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Links to Administrative Data</b>. A national disability survey,  		regardless of its other features, would significantly benefit from linkages  		with administrative data. People with disabilities participate in public  		programs at high rates; creating linkages with administrative data from federal  		programs, particularly the Social Security disability programs, Medicare, and  		Medicaid, would provide accurate historical information on program  		participation and usage. </p>
<p>There are several advantages and drawbacks to conducting a national  		disability as a means for addressing existing disability data limitations.</p>
<p><b>Advantages</b>. A national disability survey provides the flexibility  		to design a comprehensive survey that moves beyond the current level of  		coverage of disability-related issues. The key advantages of a national  		disability survey include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>As a new data collection effort, it could be designed to  			 specifically address particular existing data limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A national disability survey would be focused on disability and thus  			 would be open to many questions, including those that may be of relevance only  			 to people with disabilities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistics would be based on a single set of disability identifiers.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a new national disability survey, the identification of people  			 with disabilities who are often overlooked (for example, people with specific  			 disabilities, with difficulties responding to a particular survey format, or  			 living in institutional settings) could be prioritized. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A national survey has the potential to provide a complete life cycle  			 perspective on disability, which seem to be missing from existing  			 data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ongoing national disability survey would ensure regular and  			 consistent information over time about the experiences and well-being of people  			 with disabilities and in doing so, inform disability issues and policies and  			 make them more prominent.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Disadvantages</b>. Although theoretically appealing, the reality of a  		national disability survey comes with several disadvantages. Disadvantages of a  		national disability survey include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It is potentially expensive to design and field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There might be significant political and practical challenges in  			 attempting to coordinate, design, and implement a large undertaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is too much potential topical disability-related content to be  			 incorporated in one survey. A survey lengthy enough to cover all relevant  			 content would be prohibitively long, unless questions were spread across  			 topical modules in a longitudinal survey. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If designed to cover a broad set of topic areas, rather than focused  			 on filling an existing information gap, might be viewed as duplicative of  			 existing efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If designed as an extensive supplement to an existing survey, the  			 parent survey may be averse to adding extensive screening questions or changing  			 the sampling method to identify people with disabilities who may be  			 overlooked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If designed as a stand-alone survey, comparative information on  			 people without disabilities would either be unavailable or would require an  			 even larger sample size. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<h2>Conclusions and Potential Next Steps</h2>
<p>A substantial amount of survey and administrative data relating to  		disability is currently collected in the United States and significant progress  		has been made in improving the nature of the disability-related data collected.  		But despite this progress, important limitations to existing disability data  		persist. In this report, we have provided numerous ideas for ways in which  		disability data limitations might be addressed. Some potential next steps  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Conducting analyses to better understand the advantages and  			 limitations of the six-question disability series with the intent of developing  			 ways to improve the standard measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the use of linked survey and administrative data by  			 developing procedures to improve match rates, improving documentation, and  			 developing summary variables useful to administrative data users.</p>

<p>Pursuing opportunities to develop the capacity to use electronic  			 health records for disability-related purposes by engaging an organization  			 involved in health information technology advancement to support such an effort  			 and developing the means to identify people with disability in health  			 records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging those responsible for existing national surveys to  			 reassess their sampling frames and data collection methods to determine if  			 there are ways to increase the likelihood that people with disabilities will be  			 captured in national surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If HHS and other agencies are interested in pursuing a national  			 disability survey, the critical next step is to define the specific scope and  			 purpose of the survey.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A national disability survey can address many existing disability data  		limitations, but there also are numerous incremental means to do so. Final  		decisions regarding which specific disability data collection efforts to pursue  		will be determined by federal policy makers and program administrators whose  		agencies needs are diverse. It is unlikely that any single effort would  		address all limitations and disability data needs. But there are many possible  		strategies for ameliorating current disability data limitations and there is  		considerable room for multiple efforts, large and small.</p>
