<h2><a name="acknow" id="acknow">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h2>
<p> Many people have contributed to this report, and several deserve  		special mention. Dr. Kevin Mahoney, National Project Director, Cash and  		Counseling, now at Boston College, has guided the demonstration and evaluation  		from its inception and has been unfailingly helpful. In addition, Dr. Mahoney's  		comments on an earlier report in this series helped us sharpen the lessons  		presented here. The thoughtful, thorough comments of Dr. Lori Simon-Rusinowitz,  		Deputy National Project Director for Cash and Counseling, Center on Aging,  		University of Maryland, on an earlier report also helped us improve this  		report. Dr. Pamela Doty, Senior Policy Analyst, Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services, has been a devoted supporter of the demonstration and evaluation. Her  		comments on an earlier report challenged us to think more broadly about the  		lessons we can draw from New Jersey's experience with the Cash and Counseling  		model.</p>
<p> Dr. Randall Brown, Project Director, Evaluation of the Cash and  		Counseling Demonstration, Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) and Ms.  		Jennifer Schore, Deputy Project Director for the evaluation, provided careful,  		thorough comments that helped us improve this report.</p>
<p> Special thanks also are due to members of the Personal Preference  		staff. They include William Ditto, Project Director, Carolyn Selick, Project  		Manager, and Renee Davidson, Coordinator of Consultants, who cheerfully and  		insightfully answered our seemingly endless questions. We also thank the state  		enrollment specialist whom we interviewed.</p>
<p> We are also indebted to the others we interviewed during our visit to  		New Jersey, all of whom gave generously of their time. They include senior  		officials of the New Jersey government, members of the staff of the enrollment  		contractor, staff of several consulting agencies, staff of the fiscal agent,  		and representatives of the home care industry in New Jersey.</p>
<p> At MPR, we would like to thank Patricia Ciaccio, who carefully edited  		the report, and Marjorie Mitchell, who skillfully produced it.</p>
<p> Finally, we are deeply grateful to the people of New Jersey who  		participated in the demonstration, in either the treatment or the control  		group. Without their willingness to join in this endeavor, none of this would  		have been possible. We have learned much from them.</p>

<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p> About 1.2 million people receive disability-related supportive services  		in their homes through state Medicaid plans or home- and community-based waiver  		services programs. Under state plans, services are restricted largely to human  		assistance with personal care and homemaking and must be provided by licensed  		agencies. Additional services (such as adult day care and home modifications)  		and goods (such as assistive devices) may be offered under waiver programs.  		However, coverage of these additional services is often limited, and a case  		manager decides whether they are needed.</p>
<p> In contrast to these traditional service models, states are  		increasingly offering Medicaid beneficiaries and their families the opportunity  		to obtain personal care from individual providers--an alternative known as  		"consumer-directed" care.</p>
<p> Cash and Counseling is an expanded model of consumer-directed  		supportive services that provides a flexible monthly allowance for consumers to  		use to hire their choice of workers, including family members, and to purchase  		other services and goods. Cash and Counseling requires consumers to develop  		plans that show how they would use the allowance to meet their personal care  		needs and provides counseling and fiscal assistance to help them plan and  		manage their responsibilities. Consumers who are unable or unwilling to manage  		their care themselves may designate a representative, such as a family member,  		to help them or do it for them. These features make Cash and Counseling  		adaptable to consumers of all ages and with all types of impairments.</p>
<p> The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of the U.S. Department  		of Health and Human Services are sponsoring a demonstration and evaluation of  		Cash and Counseling. A National Program Office operates from the University of  		Maryland, Center on Aging. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services  		(CMS) is helping with the demonstration, primarily with technical assistance  		and obtaining waivers of federal Medicaid regulations. Mathematica Policy  		Research, Inc. (MPR) is evaluating the demonstration, which has been  		implemented in three states: Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey. The evaluation  		uses a randomized design--half the enrollees are assigned to a treatment group  		to receive the cash allowance, half to a control group to continue in  		traditional supportive services.</p>
<p> This report describes the design and implementation of Personal  		Preference, New Jersey's model of Cash and Counseling. It also draws lessons  		from the state's experience. The report is based primarily on in-person  		interviews conducted in April 2001, about 18 months after the program began  		enrolling beneficiaries (November 1999). Interviews were conducted with New  		Jersey state officials, Personal Preference program staff members, officials of  		organizations representing the personal care industry in New Jersey, and staff  		members of organizations providing outreach, enrollment, consulting, and fiscal  		services under Personal Preference. (New Jersey used the term "consulting"  		rather than "counseling" in its demonstration.)</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">The Personal Preference Program</h3>
<p>	<strong>Program "Cashed Out" and Eligibility. </strong>New Jersey chose  		to "cash out" Personal Care Assistance (PCA) under its state Medicaid plan. It  		did <em>not</em> cash out any of its seven Medicaid home- and community-based  		waiver programs, which provide a variety of services to special populations,  		such as medically fragile children and frail elderly people with incomes above  		the usual Medicaid threshold. Only PCA clients were to be eligible for Personal  		Preference (including current recipients of PCA and those accessed by  		traditional personal care agencies and found eligible for PCA).</p>
<p> PCA clients who wished to participate in Personal Preference but were  		unable to manage their own services were eligible to enroll. They could name a  		family member or friend as a representative to act on their behalf if they were  		selected for the cash allowance.</p>
<p>	<strong>Outreach and Enrollment.</strong> To identify eligible  		beneficiaries, New Jersey required that a personal care agency send the  		Personal Preference program a form with contact information for each  		beneficiary assessed or reassessed for PCA. The form also included information  		on care plan hours, which was used in determining the amount of the cash  		allowance for demonstration participants assigned to the treatment group.</p>
<p> The state did not work through personal care agencies to conduct  		outreach for Personal Preference; instead, it contracted with other  		organizations and hired state employees. Some agency staff members were  		concerned that the quality of care would suffer under Personal Preference,  		others that it would affect agency revenue and their employment. Therefore, New  		Jersey avoided working through agencies, out of concern that some agency staff  		might discourage PCA clients from participating in Personal Preference.</p>
<p> Although some agency staff members reportedly did discourage  		participation in the demonstration, personal care agencies were cooperative  		overall. The industry believed that the program was appropriate for some people  		with disabilities, and it had a long history with and professional respect for  		the director of Personal Preference. Moreover, Personal Preference responded to  		an important industry concern by discouraging consumers from hiring their  		agency aides.</p>
<p> During the demonstration, New Jersey both contracted with other  		organizations and hired state employees to conduct outreach and enrollment for  		Personal Preference. Concerned about possible delay in hiring state employees,  		New Jersey initially amended the contract of an organization that was helping  		the state market Medicaid managed care, adding responsibility for outreach and  		enrollment under Personal Preference. State Personal Preference staff mailed  		materials on the program to PCA recipients. Staff of the enrollment contractor  		telephoned and visited those who received materials to explain the program and  		enroll them if they wished to participate. Despite revisions to outreach and  		enrollment procedures, however, the pace of enrollment consistently fell below  		the contract target, and costs were higher than anticipated. Therefore,  		Personal Preference decided to hire state employees to conduct outreach and  		enrollment and was able to do so after substantial delay. (Because of attrition  		of state-employed enrollment staff later--after spring 2001--New Jersey again  		obtained a contractor for outreach and enrollment. It did so this time by  		amending the contract of the organization providing fiscal services under  		Personal Preference.)</p>
<p> The day-to-day outreach and enrollment activities of the enrollment  		contractor and the Personal Preference program were coordinated using a common  		database. This database was initiated with the contact and care plan  		information that personal care agencies provided and combined with information  		from New Jersey's Medicaid program. It was updated weekly as outreach and  		enrollment continued.</p>
<p> Ultimately, about 1,750 people participated in the Personal Preference  		Demonstration in New Jersey (in the treatment and control groups combined).  		They enrolled between December 1999 and June 2002.</p>
<p>	<strong>Determining the Amount of Allowance. </strong>New Jersey based  		the amount of the cash allowance on the current PCA care plan. Hours planned  		were cashed out at the hourly rates the state paid for weekday and weekend PCA  		services (in New Jersey, care plans differentiate between weekday and weekend  		hours). At about the time of our visit, the amount of the allowance ranged from  		about $300 to about $2,800 a month. The average was about $1,300.</p>
<p> No discounting was applied in determining the amount of the allowance  		under Personal Preference. (Discounting is intended to ensure the budget  		neutrality of the cash program when the cost of services received is less, on  		average, than the cost of services planned--a result, for example, of hospital  		admission of consumers or an insufficient supply of aides). While planning the  		demonstration, New Jersey had determined that the historical cost of PCA  		services received was approximately equal to the cost of services planned--an  		indication that discounting was unnecessary.</p>
<p>	<strong>Reassessment.</strong> PCA recipients are reassessed in New  		Jersey at six-month intervals. Nurses employed by personal care agencies do the  		reassessments, using a structured form that the state developed. To mimic this  		process, Personal Preference arranged for nurses employed by the Medicaid  		program to conduct reassessments of cash recipients, using the same form as  		that used for agency service recipients. This procedure eliminated the  		possibility that consultants--acting as advocates for consumers--might increase  		care plan hours (and, thus, the amount of the allowance).</p>
<p>	<strong>Cash Planning and Uses of Cash Allowance. </strong>Before  		receiving a cash allowance, Personal Preference required that consumers develop  		a plan for its use. A member of the state Personal Preference program staff had  		to approve all cash management plans and all revisions to those plans.</p>
<p> Nearly all consumers who received a cash allowance hired a  		worker--usually a family member or friend--with the funds. New Jersey exercised  		its option under demonstration waivers to allow consumers to hire legally  		liable relatives. Thus, consumers in Personal Preference could hire their  		spouses. (Under federal regulations, spouses are the only legally liable  		relatives of adults.) Some consumers also purchased assistive equipment and  		personal care supplies (not covered by Medicaid) with the allowance, and a few  		modified their homes (for example, by adding a ramp).</p>
<p>	<strong>Consulting Agencies. </strong>Initially, New Jersey recruited a  		large number of human service agencies across the state to provide consulting  		under Personal Preference. It did this to best serve New Jersey's culturally  		diverse population and to provide consumers with a choice of consulting  		agencies. To help in recruiting these agencies, New Jersey made agency  		participation administratively straightforward by signing memoranda of  		agreement (rather than contracts) with agencies providing consulting.  		Ultimately, 34 agencies signed such agreements. Some were public (for example,  		county departments of social services); some were private, nonprofit (for  		example, an Independent Living Center); and some were private, for-profit (for  		example, an agency that provided case management services).</p>
<p> Over time, the number of consulting agencies dropped dramatically  		(there were 12 in spring 2001). Some agencies withdrew from the cash program  		(partly because of competing demands on staff time), and Personal Preference  		dropped agencies not performing satisfactorily. It was possible to have fewer  		consulting agencies, partly because consumers did not have experience or  		information to help them choose an agency and did not particularly value having  		a choice. Therefore, the program began assigning consumers to agencies.</p>
<p> Personal Preference paid the consulting agency a lump sum to complete  		the cash management plan (initially $53, later increased to $75) and thereafter  		an hourly fee for consulting (initially $18, increased to $26). Rates were  		increased in part because agencies reported that the initial rates covered the  		cost of salaries, but not the cost of fringe benefits and other overhead.</p>
<p> The approach that Personal Preference adopted for payment for  		consulting services limited the state's costs for consulting. In addition to  		the single, lump-sum payment for development of the initial cash management  		plan (no matter how much consultant time was required to complete it), the cost  		of hourly consulting services was capped by limiting payment to 19 hours  		(later, 20 hours) annually per consumer.</p>
<p> New Jersey did not require Personal Preference consultants to have  		professional credentials, but most were human services professionals. Given the  		number of consulting agencies and the overall Personal Preference caseload, the  		caseload of most agencies was not large. At the time of our visit, most  		agencies had small caseloads and only one or two consultants, who also had  		other agency responsibilities.</p>
<p> Consultants had many responsibilities under Personal Preference. They  		visited treatment group members to help them prepare their initial cash  		management plans and revisions to plans. They then submitted the plans to the  		state Personal Preference office for approval. Consultants also advised  		consumers about the nonfiscal responsibilities of an employer, including  		recruiting, hiring, training, supervising, and (if necessary) firing workers.  		In addition, consultants monitored the condition of the consumer, speaking to  		consumers by telephone at least monthly (for the first six months after  		enrollment) and visiting them quarterly. Consultants were not responsible for  		monitoring the uses of the cash allowance.</p>
<p>	<strong>Fiscal Services. </strong>Personal Preference issued a  		solicitation for a single organization to provide fiscal services for consumers  		across the state. After a long process, including a legal dispute contesting  		the organization chosen initially, the state signed a contract with a New  		Jersey organization that provided a variety of human services. (Later, this  		organization provided consulting, outreach, and enrollment services in addition  		to fiscal services.)</p>
<p> The major fiscal services provided to Personal Preference consumers  		were assistance with preparation and submission of payroll tax returns and  		other documents (including those pertaining to federal and state payroll taxes  		and state unemployment insurance) and check-writing services. The fiscal agent  		implemented strict procedures for comparing timesheets and check requests with  		the cash management plan before checks were cut.</p>
<p> Personal Preference allowed consumers to receive the allowance in cash  		and accept full responsibility for its management (including payroll taxes),  		but they had to pass a skills examination before doing so. At the time of our  		visit, no consumers were managing the allowance themselves. Rather, the fiscal  		agent was holding the allowance on behalf of each consumer and disbursing funds  		in accordance with his or her cash management plan.</p>
<p> The fiscal agent earned fees from consumers for fiscal services that  		they used, and it earned fees from the state for the other services it provided  		to consumers. A schedule of charges was developed. Consumers were charged for  		such tasks as cutting a check (75 cents per check) stopping payment on a check  		($28 per stop-payment order), and arranging for a criminal background check  		($15 to $60, depending on the extent of the search). The fiscal agent charged  		the state for other tasks, such as processing W-4 forms and other forms in  		worker employment packets ($90 per packet).</p>
<p> New Jersey also provided the fiscal agent with start-up funds. Before  		there was a substantial caseload of cash recipients, the fiscal agent had a  		serious cash flow problem and obtained an internal loan from its host  		organization. New Jersey had intended that the up-front payment of start-up  		funds would limit cash flow problems; however, the fiscal agent used these  		funds mainly to purchase office equipment for its Personal Preference  		operation.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Lessons from Personal Preference</h3>
<p> New Jersey's experience provides many lessons about operating a  		consumer-directed cash allowance program under Medicaid. The state was willing  		to learn from its experience and to try a different approach if problems  		arose.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach and Enrollment</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Self-screening of personal assistance recipients for  			 appropriateness is workable</em>. </strong>It would have been difficult (if not  			 impossible) to develop a formal process to identify in advance consumers who  			 would be unable to manage the cash benefit, either by themselves or with the  			 help of representatives. Instead, Personal Preference relied on consumers and  			 representatives to screen themselves, and this approach worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Providing for language diversity is important and  			 possible in a consumer-directed program</em>.</strong> Non-English-speaking  			 consumers may be able to benefit greatly from hiring workers who speak their  			 languages and are familiar with their cultures. Personal Preference hired staff  			 members who spoke the languages most common in New Jersey. It also translated  			 program materials into these languages, prepared a notice in 14 languages  			 asking consumers to have materials translated, asked family members and friends  			 to translate, and used the AT&amp;T language line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Information should be available in multiple media to  			 accommodate those with vision and hearing impairments and those who are not  			 competent readers in any language</em>. </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>To keep program costs down, efficiency in arranging home  			 visits to describe the program and enroll beneficiaries is  			 important</em>.</strong> Travel time can be reduced by scheduling visits on the  			 same day to several beneficiaries in the same area. Repeat visits can be  			 avoided by having family members present during the initial enrollment visit,  			 even if that visit has to be scheduled outside of business hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>To conduct outreach and enrollment, external contracting  			 is not necessarily better than the hiring of state employees (or vice  			 versa)</em>.</strong> Neither the Personal Preference enrollment contractor nor  			 state employees were able to sustain an enrollment pace that met the  			 sample-size target for the evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>While both elderly adults and younger adults with  			 physical disabilities found Personal Preference attractive, younger adults  			 appear to have been more likely to enroll</em>.</strong> More than half (53  			 percent) of those enrolled in the demonstration were elderly beneficiaries.  			 However, younger adult participants in the Personal Preference demonstration  			 represented more than 20 percent of the number of non-elderly adult PCA  			 recipients in New Jersey in the year before the demonstration, while the  			 elderly participants represented just over 10 percent of the number of elderly  			 PCA recipients that year. Thus, the cash program in New Jersey attracted a  			 substantial minority, but not a majority, of adult Medicaid personal care  			 recipients.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Consulting Agencies</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Cash allowance programs may find it difficult to recruit  			 enough agencies to provide consumers across the state with a choice of agencies  			 providing satisfactory consulting services</em>.</strong> New Jersey had  			 difficulty recruiting multiple agencies in some parts of the state and dropped  			 some agencies out of dissatisfaction with the consulting services  			 provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Consumers do not necessarily value having a choice of  			 consulting agencies</em>.</strong> Most Personal Preference consumers did not  			 have knowledge about or experience with the agencies offering consulting and  			 did not seem to value having a choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Agencies of a variety of auspices can satisfactorily  			 provide consulting</em>.</strong> Satisfactory consulting services were  			 provided to Personal Preference consumers by public; private, nonprofit; and  			 for-profit agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>A minimum agency caseload is necessary for efficient  			 provision of consulting. This caseload needs to be large enough to support a  			 single consultant, working for an appreciable portion of time on the Cash and  			 Counseling program</em>.</strong> Consultants with small caseloads have  			 difficulty staying up-to-date on program procedures and policies. Having a  			 single consultant per agency can work, although that consultant needs peer  			 support, supervision, and backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Having 10 to 15 consulting agencies statewide can  			 work</em>. </strong>Having a large number of consulting agencies consumes  			 program staff time to recruit (and replace) agencies and to ensure the quality  			 of consulting services. By spring 2001, 12 agencies (down from 34) were  			 providing Personal Preference consulting, and the state program staff was  			 satisfied with their performance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cash Planning and Consulting Services</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Careful planning of the initial consulting home visit  			 reduces the need for multiple visits and thus cuts delays in receipt of the  			 cash allowance and program costs</em>.</strong> Before the initial consulting  			 visit, Personal Preference consumers were asked to begin to think about how to  			 spend the allowance, whom to hire, and whether to name a representative. Family  			 members and friends who were potential workers and representatives were asked  			 to be present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Revisions to the cash management plan are frequently  			 necessary</em>. </strong>Because expenditures are checked against the cash  			 management plan, the plan must be revised to reflect changes in consumer need,  			 and such changes occur frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>The need for revisions to cash management plans can be  			 reduced by writing flexible plans, and the cost of revision can be reduced by  			 automation</em>.</strong> Personal Preference reduced the number of situations  			 in which a revision was required by writing flexible cash plans that did not  			 name workers or vendors. The program entered the cash plan into an electronic  			 spreadsheet, thereby speeding recalculation of plan totals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Consumers need varying amounts of consultant assistance,  			 with some needing a substantial amount</em>. </strong>Some Personal Preference  			 consumers needed substantially more consulting assistance than others did, and  			 some needed substantially more than expected. The 19 hours of consulting a year  			 for which Personal Preference would pay (after the cash plan was in place) was  			 sometimes exhausted.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Representatives</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Many consumers participating in the Cash and Counseling  			 model will name a representative to help them manage the cash  			 allowance</em>.</strong> Personal Preference consultants reported that up to  			 two-thirds of elderly beneficiaries named representatives. Sometimes, the  			 family (rather than the consumer) wanted a representative named.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Representatives are usually family members or friends  			 who are already helping the consumer.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>The need for a representative depends on the  			 availability of training from consultants, familiarity with the cash program,  			 and availability of supportive equipment--as well as consumer  			 disability</em>.</strong> As consumers learn about the cash program from  			 consultants, the consumer may take over management of the allowance from a  			 representative. Rarely, supportive equipment (such as a talking computer for a  			 blind consumer) can eliminate the need for a representative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>The role of the representative can vary  			 considerably</em>.</strong> While the representative was the sole decision  			 maker for those Personal Preference consumers who were completely unable to  			 communicate their preferences, both the consumer and representative typically  			 contributed to the management of the cash allowance under Personal Preference.  			 In some cases, representatives solicited consumer preferences; in other cases,  			 consumers and representatives functioned as a team. Sometimes, the consumer was  			 the primary decision maker and the representative functioned as a liaison to  			 the outside world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Representatives successfully manage the cash allowance  			 on behalf of consumers</em>.</strong> Consultants judged that representatives  			 were obtaining input from the consumers when possible and were faithful to the  			 best interests of the consumers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Amount of Allowance</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>The appropriate discount rate may change over  			 time</em>.</strong> New Jersey personal care industry sources reported a  			 substantial reduction during the demonstration in average hours of personal  			 assistance received, as a result of a state utilization review. Hours received  			 also may have been reduced by changes in the supply of aides as the  			 unemployment rate fell. These changes may have resulted in a change in the  			 ratio of the cost of hours of care planned to hours of care received, and  			 possibly a need to introduce a discount rate for Personal Preference.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Uses of Cash</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Restrictions on the use of the cash allowance need not  			 trouble consumers</em>.</strong> Most consumers did not find the Personal  			 Preference program's restrictions on the uses of the cash allowance  			 troublesome. While insisting that purchases be related to the need for personal  			 assistance, the program fostered creative use of the allowance and interpreted  			 it broadly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>The Cash and Counseling model appears to tap a new  			 source of personal assistance workers--family members and  			 friends</em>.</strong> Program staff reported that most workers hired by  			 consumers were willing to assist a loved one but were not interested in agency  			 employment. Family members and friends can help people whom agencies were not  			 able to serve fully.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Time to Receipt of Cash Payment</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Streamlined procedures can reduce time to receipt of the  			 first cash payment</em>. </strong>Under Personal Preference, the time required  			 for each of the steps leading up to receipt of the cash payment could  			 appreciably delay its receipt. Elimination of consumer choice of consulting  			 agencies reduced delay to receipt of the first cash payment, and Personal  			 Preference decreased notice time to personal care agencies regarding consumers  			 about to receive their first cash payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Communication problems can be serious enough to increase  			 the time to receipt of the first cash payment</em>. </strong>With four major  			 actors (consumer/representative, consultant, state program staff, and fiscal  			 staff), there were 12 one-way communication pathways under Personal Preference.  			 From this perspective, it is not surprising that communication was sometimes  			 serious enough to delay receipt of the first cash payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Efficient procedures can reduce communication  			 problems</em>. </strong>Personal Preference improved communication by training  			 consumers about whom to call for what issue, adding an explanation of errors in  			 exception reports from the fiscal agent, and using multiple-party telephone  			 calls to reduce the need for several one-on-one calls.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Consumers as Employers</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Almost all consumers (including those with  			 representatives) prefer to have a fiscal agent handle payroll functions and  			 disburse funds from the allowance</em>.</strong> Although Personal Preference  			 consumers paid modest fees for the services of the fiscal agent, they  			 overwhelmingly chose to delegate responsibility for payroll functions and check  			 writing to the fiscal agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Recruiting is critical for those consumers who do not  			 have family or friends available to hire as workers</em>.</strong> Personal  			 Preference program staff reported that the receipt of the cash allowance was  			 delayed for consumers who had difficulty recruiting a worker and that those who  			 could not recruit a worker tended to drop out of the program. (Since our visit,  			 New Jersey has moved to develop a worker registry to assist consumers in  			 recruiting workers.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Almost all consumers (who are able to recruit workers)  			 learn to fulfill the non-fiscal responsibilities of employers</em>.</strong>  			 Personal Preference consumers (and representatives) varied with respect to the  			 amount of consultant training they needed on hiring, training, supervising and  			 firing workers. However, even those who needed a substantial amount of  			 consultant assistance, learned in time to fulfill successfully the non-fiscal  			 responsibilities of an employer.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Avoiding Abuse and Exploitation</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><em>Abuse of a cash allowance--even an allowance of a  			 substantial amount--can be prevented by careful development of a management  			 cash plan, followed by strict enforcement of procedures to ensure payment for  			 only those goods and services allowed under the plan</em>.</strong> Personal  			 Preference cash allowances averaged about $1,300 a month at the time of our  			 visit. Every cash management plan (including every revised plan) was reviewed  			 to be sure that only allowable goods and services were included, and the fiscal  			 agent rigorously checked every disbursement against the cash plan. Review of  			 receipts was not required in Personal Preference and thus was unimportant in  			 preventing abuse of the cash allowance in New Jersey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Neglect and exploitation of consumers can be eliminated  			 before cash payment is made if members of the program staff are mindful of the  			 possibility and attentive to cases in which something seems  			 amiss</em>.</strong> Under Personal Preference, the few cases of potential  			 neglect or exploitation were identified before or during the first home visit  			 by consultants. These cases were resolved before the consumers received their  			 first cash payment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Value of Counseling and Fiscal Services to  		Consumers</strong></p>
<p> The tenet of the Cash and Counseling model that most distinguishes it  		from other benefit and voucher programs is the provision of counseling and  		fiscal services to help consumers manage the cash allowance. Clearly, consumers  		valued having fiscal services available. Although consumers were charged fees  		for fiscal services, almost all chose to use the fiscal agent.</p>
<p> The value of consulting services is more difficult to assess. Consumers  		varied greatly in the amount of advice and assistance they needed from  		consultants. Many needed oral explanations of the program and its procedures,  		in addition to written materials. Some needed a great deal of assistance as  		they developed a cash management plan, recruited workers, and fulfilled the  		other responsibilities of an employer. Overall, consulting seems to have been  		very valuable--perhaps essential--to the success of the cash program in New  		Jersey. Future analysis of surveys that asked consumers about their  		satisfaction with consultants will shed more light on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Future Cash Program?</strong></p>
<p> New Jersey views a consumer-directed cash program as a valuable part of  		a package of programs within its Medicaid state plan designed to meet the needs  		of its citizens. The state is working to offer an ongoing waiver program  		similar to Personal Preference and is interested in expanding the personal  		assistance benefit to include equipment so that it can offer a  		consumer-directed program similar to Personal Preference without waiver  		authority.</p>
