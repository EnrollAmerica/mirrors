<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong>EXAMINING  SUBSTITUTION: STATE STRATEGIES TO LIMIT CROWD OUT IN THE ERA OF  CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE</strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In recent years, state  initiatives to provide health insurance for low-income children  have raised a new set of concerns regarding the actual and  potential impact of employer- and individual-based substitution.  As a number of states elected to expand Medicaid in the late  1980s, researchers began to explore the possibility that Medicaid  was substituting for private coverage. By 1992, substitution  became a more salient concern as states expanded coverage to all  pregnant women and children up to age 6 with incomes up to 133%  of the federal poverty level (FPL), and more than half of the  states elected to receive federal matching funds to cover all  pregnant women and infants up to 185% FPL. As Federal and state  governments seek to increase the proportion of people with health  coverage, it is critical to understand the nature and extent of  substitution. Concerns focus on the potential that if Medicaid  and other public expansions are responsible for shifting  individuals from employer-sponsored insurance to public programs,  the effectiveness of public funds to expand insurance coverage  might be limited. As programs minimize the effects of  substitution, states will then have the ability to target funding  specifically for insuring children who do not have access to  affordable health coverage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Enabled under Title XXI of the  Social Security Act, the State Childrens Health Insurance  Program (CHIP) is providing $24 billion in funding to states over  a five-year period to provide health insurance to uninsured  children. The purpose of the law is to assist states in  initiating and expanding childrens health assistance  programs to uninsured, low-income children. This assistance can  be provided through one of three methods: (a) a program to  initiate and expand the provision of health care assistance via a  separate State Insurance Program; (b) a Medicaid expansion; or  (c) a combination of these methods. Eligibles include children  under age 19 not eligible for Medicaid with family incomes below  200% of the federal poverty level or 50% above the current state  Medicaid limit. State expansions could begin as early as October  1, 1997. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The primary objective of Title  XXI, to insure uninsured children, charges states to expand the  number of eligible children with health insurance beyond current  Medicaid eligibility limits. As research has suggested that  substitution is most commonly seen in higher income ranges,  substitution of state-funded programs for private insurance  coverage has become a substantial concern. Further complicating  the issue, families are making difficult decisions which may  directly impact individually-based substitution. For example,  families may opt to substitute a separate state program for  private insurance <i>or</i> for Medicaid. It is important to  understand that family decisions are based upon affordability of  plans, comparability of the benefit packages, and health status  of children. State and national research has <i>not</i> produced  conclusive evidence that employers are dropping coverage, yet  there <i>is</i> evidence that employer-based coverage is  declining. Several states have suggested that the coverage issue,  in most cases, is not employers dropping coverage, rather  individuals are choosing to opt out of private insurance coverage  for state subsidized programs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Research has attempted to assess  the amount of substitution, suggested ways to limit its effects,  and weighed the benefits and costs of expanding Medicaid with the  potential of crowding out private insurance. Limited data and the  complexity of the issue make it difficult to accurately measure  the crowd out of public programs for employer-sponsored  insurance. Actual substitution is complicated by secular trends  including the following: the decline in employer-sponsored  insurance; increasing levels of employee premium contributions;  the decrease of unionization; and the shift from manufacturing to  lower wage service industries. The complexity of measuring  substitution and limited state-specific data contributes to  conflicting estimates of substitution and makes it challenging  for State governments to address substitution in the design and  implementation of their childrens health insurance  programs. It has also been difficult to apply research focusing  on Medicaid expansions to other models of providing low-income  children with health coverage. With few estimates indicating the  degree of actual substitution and little data on the demographic  profile of the "substituters," the discussion on  substitution has been primarily based on the <i>perceived</i>  effect of crowding out private coverage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two ways that  substitution can occur under CHIP. First, there can be  substitution of coverage which can occur when families or  employers drop existing private coverage to enroll in CHIP.  Second, there can be substitution of premiums which can occur  when employers reduce their contribution levels of dependent  coverage because families are able to obtain subsidies that  offset the reduced amount of contributions. To assist states as  they address issues related to substitution in their Title XXI  plans, this paper focuses primarily on an examination of the  experiences of a set of states that have already developed and  implemented childrens health insurance programs prior to  the creation of Title XXI. Qualitative data, which was collected  from state officials through interviews and a round-table  discussion, augments previous research by examining states  perceptions and their actual experiences with substitution. </font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong>State Mechanisms  To Limit Substitution</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">State strategies to address  substitution include nine mechanisms that either purposefully or  inadvertently limit two types of substitution: individual-based  and employer-based. Because different dynamics drive employee and  employer substitution, states have implemented specific  mechanisms to address these two types of substitution. For the  most part, state officials agreed that the primary concern is  whether, and to what extent, previously insured workers are  dropping their employer-sponsored coverage. Substitution of  coverage seems to be primarily driven by individual choices  rather than employers strategically eliminating coverage.  Although states have distinguished between individual- and  employer-based substitution and have established mechanisms  focused on limiting both types of crowd out, states and  researchers also have identified the overlap between the two.  Substitution is a result of the dynamic relationship between the  types of benefits employers want to provide to employees and the  willingness of employees to participate in the programs offered.  Both employers, in offering coverage, and employees, in taking up  coverage, are forced to make complex decisions which are driven  by complicated issues such as secular trends in the economy and  family dynamics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The extent to which states  deliberately institute mechanisms limiting substitution varies by  program and state. In some cases, substitution appears to be  restricted indirectly through mechanisms established in program  designs for other purposes. For example, many states require  copayments for services rendered which mirror cost-sharing in the  private market. Although required copayments are customarily  included in program design for financial purposes, when  comparable to private market copayments they limit the number of  individuals who drop private insurance to enroll in  state-subsidized programs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mechanisms limiting individual  based substitution. State mechanisms to limit individual-based  substitution primarily target those dynamics that prompt family  decisions to opt out of private coverage such as: the cost  comparisons of copayments and premiums; the affordability of  private coverage; and the comprehensiveness of benefits. The  majority of states efforts to curb substitution has focused  on the dynamics that drive families to opt out since  individual-based substitution is a greater concern than  employer-based substitution. The primary mechanisms utilized by  states include the following: (1) evaluating affordability of  private coverage; (2) requiring periods of uninsurance; (3)  providing subsidies; and (4) limiting the scope of benefit  packages. These mechanisms are effective ways to curb  substitution by making state-sponsored childrens health  insurance comparable to employer-sponsored coverage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 1: Identifying  the Affordability of Private Coverage: Setting Premiums and  Copayments That Do Not Deter Utilization or Enrollment </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Several states have identified  the <i>affordability</i> of employer-sponsored insurance as an  important consideration in the implementation of mechanisms to  limit crowd out. Affordability is usually defined as the  percentage of family income that is believed families could or  are willing to use to purchase health care. In developing  strategies, states have considered the tradeoffs between  encouraging participation and limiting substitution.  Specifically, states have identified the importance of  establishing cost sharing (e.g., premiums and copayments) that is  low enough to encourage participation, yet high enough to limit  substitution. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>Setting Premiums.</u> While  there are no data that <i>directly</i> link the establishment of  premiums as a deterrent to families opting out of employer-based  coverage, several states anticipate that this is the case. New  York specifically identified that while increases in monthly  premiums were not established as a mechanism to discourage  substitution, it is anticipated that newly established increases  will ultimately result in <i>reducing</i> individual-based crowd  out. The state has identified that a $9 to $13 monthly premium  per child should discourage families from dropping employer  coverage to enroll in the New York Child Health Plus Program.  Floridas Healthy Kids program has set premiums that range  from $5-10 per child per month for families below 130% FPL and  $13-27 per child per month for families from 131-185% FPL.  Families pay 100% of premium above 185% FPL. Florida experimented  with raising premiums beyond ten dollars, but found these amounts  directly resulted in decreased enrollment. Nevertheless, state  program representatives felt that premiums at a lower level  (between $5-10) were a viable means of evoking a sense of  responsibility in participants by making public insurance  comparable to employer-sponsored coverage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>Defining Copayments.</u> Many  existing childrens health insurance programs have  established copayments for physician visits, prescriptions, and  emergency room use as mechanisms to mirror the requirements of  private coverage. The initial intent behind establishing  copayments varied by program. The primary rationales state  officials expressed were to offset costs and to instill a sense  of responsibility in participants. Some states believe that price  sensitivity was a critical aspect of determining copayments and  cost-sharing policies. Florida and Rhode Island program officials  identified the importance of establishing copayments that do not  deter eligible families from enrolling in state programs and  utilizing necessary services, yet do not encourage the  inappropriate use of services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 2: Using  Periods of Uninsurance, Access to Employer-Sponsored Insurance,  and Employer Contributions</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Several states have established  requirements based on access to employer-sponsored insurance,  employer contributions, and/or specific periods of uninsurance as  a means to limit substitution. MinnesotaCare has instituted  relatively stringent time and cost requirements, described by  some as "firewalls" in order to prevent the crowd out  of employer-sponsored insurance<b><i>. </i></b>For example,  MinnesotaCare requires that prior to enrollment in the program,  families may <i>not</i> have access to employer-sponsored  coverage in which an employer subsidizes <i>50% or more</i> of  the cost of the policy for at least <i>eighteen months</i>  preceding application to the program. Exemptions to this include  children under 150% FPL and situations where a parent in a family  over 150% FPL becomes unemployed, does not qualify for workers  compensation, and is unable to pay for COBRA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The process of verification of  access to employer-sponsored insurance, employer contributions,  and periods of uninsurance has been challenging for states. Most  states verify eligibility based on self disclosure or the  "honor system," as other means of verification are  costly and increase the complexity of enrollment processes. Some  states have chosen to piggy back on other existing state programs  in order to efficiently evaluate eligibility status. The most  commonly cited example has been the process used by the Florida  Healthy Kids Corporation in which eligible children are required  to qualify for the National School Lunch Program. Other states  have chosen to utilize existing verification structures of state  Medicaid programs to assist in the determination of eligible  enrollees. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 3: Use of  Subsidies</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Some states are designing their  programs to work in tandem with employer-sponsored coverage as a  means of limiting substitution. Assisting families to purchase  private coverage with public funds may deter families from  dropping, or not pursuing employer-sponsored insurance beyond  their economic reach. While subsidies support families in  purchasing insurance in the private market, they may also  contribute to substitution. Oregon's 1997-1999 budget proposed  the creation of the <i>Family Health Insurance Assistance Program</i>  (FHIAP), an insurance subsidy program for families with incomes  between 100% and 185% of poverty. Essentially, FHIAP will  establish a voucher system for families with access to  employer-sponsored insurance, assisting eligible families in  buying into employer-sponsored programs. Colorado has also  considered subsidizing families insurance as a viable means  of limiting substitution and is considering the implementation of  a voucher program. Colorado has identified this strategy as an  approach that will prompt the public and private sector to  cooperate in the process to insure children. Florida is also  considering a type of voucher mechanism that will assist families  in purchasing coverage as a supplement to Healthy Kids and other  efforts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 4:Limiting the  Scope of the Benefit Package</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Limiting the scope or  comprehensiveness of the benefit package is another mechanism  that seems to deter families from opting out of employer  coverage. The CaliforniaKids program, the Massachusetts  Childrens Medical Security Plan, and until recently, New  Yorks Child Health Plus program, declined to offer  inpatient care with the rationale that it was better to provide a  more modest benefit package to greater numbers of children.  Although CaliforniaKids and Child Health Plus were primarily  concerned with stretching their funding to meet the basic health  care needs of as many children as possible, representatives from  both programs believed that excluding inpatient care deterred  substitution. These programs were comfortable with offering a  limited benefit package, knowing that Medicaid would serve as a  safety net for children requiring inpatient care or extended  benefits. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Three types of mechanisms are  being used by states to enhance the affordability of  employer-sponsored insurance: While there is no evidence to  suggest that employers are strategically eliminating health  coverage so that their workers may receive public insurance,  several states have been proactive in designing mechanisms to  encourage the availability of affordable employer-sponsored  insurance<b>. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 5: Purchasing  Cooperatives</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Health insurance purchasing  cooperatives, which assist employers in purchasing insurance at  more affordable rates, are enabling small employers to offer  benefits in Oregon and Rhode Island. The State supported  Associated Oregon Industries (AOI) efforts to develop a  privately sponsored Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative  (HIPC) targeted at small group employers. AOI, Oregons  largest business organization, shows promise for assisting small  employers in maintaining existing or establishing new insurance  programs to employees. Rhode Island has four small business  purchasing cooperatives that may be deterring crowd out by making  the provision of insurance by small businesses affordable.</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 6: Employer  Buy-Ins</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Allowing employers to directly  buy into state programs at reasonable costs is another means of  encouraging employers to take responsibility for sponsoring  workers' insurance. The Washington Basic Health Plan (BHP)  established provisions in which employers can buy into the  program. As BHP is generally less expensive than private  insurance for most employers due to subsidized premiums for  low-income workers, there is a positive incentive for employers  to participate. The employer buy-in also provides employers the  benefit of the larger purchasing power and risk pool of the  state. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Mechanism 7:  Reimbursements To Small Businesses</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Assisting employers through  reimbursement plans is another strategy geared toward helping  small employers purchase health coverage. Massachusetts has  planned the implementation of an experimental program in the year  1999, entitled the "Insurance Reimbursement Plan" to be  administered through the Medical Assistance program. The Plan  will be structured to reimburse small businesses (i.e., employers  with less than 50 workers) that cover in excess of 50% of the  cost of insurance for their employees. Eligible employers will be  annually reimbursed $1000 for family coverage, $800 for couples  coverage, and $500 for individual coverage. This option, not yet  implemented, has been considered quite controversial as it would  be paying employers to provide insurance, which in some cases,  they may already offer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Disconnect Between State  Experiences and Research</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">While research has yielded  varying estimates of crowding out private coverage, ranging from  0-50%, states providing coverage for low-income children indicate  they have seen little evidence of these levels of substitution.  Although the majority of these states have not collected  sufficient data to determine an accurate estimate of crowd-out,  states anecdotal evidence pointed to minimal numbers of  enrollees with access to <i>affordable</i> private coverage and  did not seem to warrant further investigations. States queried  about their experience with substitution noted that despite some  researchers predictions about employers strategically  eliminating or reducing their contribution to employee health  benefits, real or potential crowd out is primarily the result of  families opting to discontinue private insurance for financial  reasons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">States that have collected  information on the number of program participants with previous  insurance, revealed estimates that were lower than estimates  derived from nationally-based research. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">? Preliminary data from  Colorados Child Health Plan estimate that 0.007% dropped  employer coverage to enroll in the plan. In addition 5% of their  enrollees carry other insurance coverage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">? Floridas Healthy Kids  program estimates that 94% of their children had been uninsured  for 6-12 months before enrolling in Healthy Kids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">? New York found that more than  50% of all Child Health Plus enrollees had no insurance at all  during their lifetimes; approximately one-sixth had Medicaid  prior to Child Health Plus; and approximately one-sixth were  underinsured or fully insured.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">MinnesotaCare, which began as a  state sponsored program in 1992 and switched to a Medicaid waiver  program expansion in 1995, is one of the few programs that has  evaluated their participants' access to private coverage.  MinnesotaCare, offering coverage to families with children under  275% of the federal poverty level, noted that approximately 13%  of their enrollees technically had access to other health  coverage: 7.1% reported giving up private market insurance and  5.7% of the sample reported dropping coverage from another public  program to enroll in MinnesotaCare. Of note, the majority of  enrollees who had access to private insurance said they could not  afford it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Implications For Future  Expansions Under Title XXI of the Social Security Act</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Current research coupled with  past experiences of states provides some information for states  to consider as they plan and implement programs funded by Title  XXI. Four major program design issues were identified as  important areas in addressing substitution: the overall design of  the program; determining whether to use Medicaid expansions or  separate state programs; the development of specific provisions  related to employer coverage; and the oversight and evaluation of  the expanded program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most difficult issues  facing states is how to design a program that neither limits  access to new coverage, nor replaces existing insurance coverage.  Among the many programmatic areas that need to be addressed are:  the determination of an appropriate benefit package; the  implementation of suitable cost-sharing measures; the development  of an administratively simple, yet stringent enrollment process;  the identification of appropriate eligibility criteria that will  encourage enrollment, while limiting substitution; and strategies  focused on collaboration with the private market. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is essential for children's  health insurance programs to adequately design programs that  target children not eligible for Medicaid, affordable  employer-sponsored, or other health insurance programs.  Implementation of well-defined state programs that conduct  outreach to enroll targeted children while controlling for  substitution, may be a vehicle through which states can actually  increase participation in all forms of available insurance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As state programs to insure  children have evolved, such expansions have raised a new set of  concerns about the effectiveness of these state programs in  enrolling only their targeted populations. As programs have  expanded into higher income ranges, policy makers, program  administrators, and researchers have expressed a concern about  the potential that these programs have begun to substitute for  employer-sponsored insurance. In an era of limited public  resources, the erosion of employer-sponsored insurance coverage  has taken center stage in the debate over new or expanded state  health insurance programs at the federal level and in some  states.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">States' strategic choices to be  evaluated in the light of federal program goals include: (a)  reducing the number of uninsured children over time; (b)  increasing the participation of children in public programs for  which they are eligible; (c) minimizing the potential to cover  children who would have otherwise had private insurance coverage;  and (d) creating a private/public partnership which increases  coverage for children in the private market. Given the goals of  the federal program, states need to determine not only how they  will develop strategies to limit substitution, but also how they  will evaluate the cost of enforcing enrollment barriers of  potential eligibles and the overall impact on administrative  complexity. </font></p>
