<h2 align="LEFT">BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>The Texas state legislature included a rider to the biennial budget in  		its 2002-2003 General Appropriations Act intended to promote choice,  		independence, and community integration for Medicaid-funded nursing facility  		residents who expressed a desire to live in the community. Rider 37, as this  		provision was generally known, allowed Medicaid funds that were being spent for  		a person in a nursing facility to be transferred to the states  		community-based care budget when the individual elected to return to the  		community. The initiative was re-authorized in the 2004-2005 budget as Rider 28  		and established in regulation in summer 2005 as the <i>Money Follows the  		Person</i> (MFP) funding policy. Unlike the Rider initiative, the MFP policy in  		its current form is now a full-fledged program with peripheral supports in  		place statewide, including relocation contractors, transition assistance funds,  		and interdisciplinary transition teams. </p>
<p>The Rider initiative in Texas is noted as an example that could serve as  		a model for other states with similar objectives. In this study, commissioned  		by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of  		the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we examine the experiences in  		the early years of the Rider initiative using information from site visits to  		four Texas communities in spring 2004 and analysis of Texas Medicaid long-term  		care data. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 10,156 people had moved to the  		community under the Rider initiative and the new MFP program.</p>
<p>Effectively, the Rider initiative provided an alternative eligibility  		route for the states various Medicaid community care programs. The  		largest Medicaid community care program in Texas, Community-Based Alternatives  		(CBA), serves older people and adults with physical disabilities who meet the  		criteria for nursing facility admission. It provides a comprehensive benefit  		package of long-term care services, including personal care services, nursing,  		minor home modifications, and therapies. All but a handful of Rider  		participants enter the CBA waiver program, so in this report we focus on that  		program. </p>
<p></p>
<h2 align="LEFT">STUDY OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>The research questions posed by ASPE fall into three broad areas: the  		transition process, participant characteristics, and service utilization and  		costs. The process issues studied include how the initiative works at the state  		and regional level, eligibility and enrollment processes, the scope of services  		and benefits, quality monitoring procedures, nursing facility participation in  		and reactions to the initiative, characteristics of Rider participants, as well  		as implementation issues and how they were resolved. </p>
<p></p>
<h2 align="LEFT">DATA AND METHODS</h2>
<p>The study included both a qualitative and a quantitative component. The  		qualitative component consisted of site visits to four counties in three Texas  		Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) service regions. Sites were  		chosen to reflect the diversity of regions and populations in Texas, and  		focused on areas with a large number of Rider transitions. Key informants  		included regional DADS officials and an array of provider and community  		stakeholders involved in assisting with or managing transitions under the  		Rider. Discussion topics included outreach and education about the Rider  		initiative for staff, nursing facility clients, and nursing facilities; the  		process to transition; procedures for monitoring clients after transition and  		assuring quality of services; administrative procedures and perceived burden;  		characteristics of participating clients and their facilities; service capacity  		in the community; and client satisfaction. </p>
<p>The quantitative component of the study used data from Texas Medicaid  		long-term care data files to explore how Medicaid recipients who opted to  		transition to the community through the Rider (Rider participants)  		compared to their non-Rider counterparts who remained in nursing facilities  		(nursing facility residents) or who received services through the  		CBA program (CBA clients). The Rider population studied consisted  		of 4,870 individuals who entered the CBA program directly after a nursing  		facility stay. The CBA population studied consisted of 15,895 non-Rider  		participants entering the CBA program beginning in September 2001 when the  		Rider took effect. The nursing facility resident sample consisted of 65,132  		residents who did not use the Rider and who had at least one Medicaid nursing  		facility payment in October 2003. We compared these groups on an array of  		demographics, medical diagnoses, and expected level of care dependence. Within  		each of the groups and across characteristics, we looked at service use,  		average monthly cost of services, and individual status after entry into the  		CBA program. We also report on the proportion of facilities with Rider  		transitions, the frequency of transitions, and characteristics of facilities  		with and without transitions. </p>
<p>Eligibility for the CBA program is restricted to adults ages 21 and  		over. As an extension, this analysis is limited to the same age group.  		Therefore, findings in this report and policy implications extending from it  		cannot be generalized to children. </p>
<p></p>
<h2 align="LEFT">FINDINGS: OVERVIEW</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Texas initiated a MFP policy by authorizing the transfer of funds  		  from one Medicaid account to another under a rider to its general  		  appropriations bill. Program eligibility and procedures did not change, which  		  allowed this far-reaching change to be accomplished relatively smoothly.  		  </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Texass experience with the Rider 37/28 initiative demonstrates  		that a MFP component can be incorporated relatively easily into an existing  		Medicaid long-term care program. This far-reaching change in the states  		approach to long-term care was accomplished through the authorization of an  		accounting mechanism allowing funds to be shifted provisionally from the  		nursing facility component of the Medicaid budget to the community care  		component. In Texas, because community care programs were in place prior to  		this accounting change, the only change that the Rider made to the Medicaid  		long-term care program was, in effect, to identify the nursing facility  		population as a separate eligibility category for community care programs and  		to make this eligibility group exempt from any caps on enrollment in these  		programs. The comprehensive nature of the CBA benefits package allowed a  		diverse population of nursing facility residents to move back to residential  		settings that were more integrated in the community. In Texas, the accounting  		provisions embodied in Riders 37 and 28 later became one component in a  		comprehensive MFP funding policy, which defined a Medicaid long-term care  		program and incorporated lessons from the Rider initiative about the transition  		process.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 align="LEFT">FINDINGS: PROCESS</h2>
<p class="Heading2"><b><i>Outreach</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>There is both formal and informal outreach to potential  		  participants in the Rider. An array of stakeholders notifies nursing home  		  residents about the Rider and identifies potential clients for transition to  		  the community.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all three regions where site visits took place, DADS staff  		caseworkers and social workers at nursing facilities serve key roles in  		identifying clients who are interested in or suitable for transition to the  		community. Local ombudsmen and advocates for the elderly and disabled are an  		important additional source of information; in some regions, they advocate for  		and assist residents transitions. As the initiative has matured, word of  		mouth has become a source of information for potential clients. </p>
<p><b><i>Steps to a Transition </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Steps to a transition include determining eligibility, developing a  		  service plan, and contracting for services in the community prior to the  		  nursing home residents discharge. Eligibility for community programs is  		  determined while the participant is still in the nursing facility, which  		  minimizes gaps in services.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individuals who are interested in leaving the nursing facility are  		assigned a DADS caseworker and work with a home health agency to develop an  		Individual Service Plan (ISP). The residents choice of agencies and input  		into the ISP is his or her chief opportunity to influence the care plan, as  		Texas waiver programs do not currently include provisions for consumer  		direction. The DADS caseworker then arranges for all of the necessary  		components of the plan to be put in place by the time the client leaves the  		nursing facility. Eligibility and service coordination tasks are conducted  		while the client resides in the nursing facility. DADS staff generally felt  		that the presence of informal supports greatly facilitated the transition  		process, but that clients without informal supports were able to transition.  		Estimates of the time from identification of an eligible resident to the day he  		or she moved back to the community ranged from one to two months up to as long  		as four to five months. </p>
<p><b><i>Issues Affecting a Smooth Transition to the Community </i></b></p>
<p>Informants identified three primary issues affecting a smooth transition  		to the community. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Payment for community-based services cannot be made prior to a  		  clients discharge from the nursing facility, which sometimes complicates  		  the coordination of services needed in place by the clients first day in  		  the community. </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An overarching issue affecting smooth transition to the community arises  		from the fact that the Rider is, in effect, an accounting mechanism that  		transfers funds from one program budget to another. Clients cannot receive  		services from a nursing facility and a community care program at the same time,  		but in order for a participants home to be made ready, home modifications  		need to be complete and adaptive aids and other supports in place when the  		client arrives. Changes had to be made in state policy to allow work such as  		home modifications to be contracted before the client leaves the nursing  		facility, even though payment for these contracts cannot be made until the  		clients first day in the community. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Respondents reported that the most difficult challenges to  		  implementing transitions were finding suitable housing, identifying accessible  		  transportation, and finding a physician in the community.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most difficult challenges reported by site visit informants related  		to components of community care that are beyond the scope of the CBA program  		itself. Difficulty finding acceptable housing was identified as a pervasive  		problem that often delayed transition. The lack of accessible transportation in  		areas where housing was most affordable was problematic for placing  		participants. Finding a physician in the community was reported to be most  		difficult for long-term nursing facility residents or those new to the  		community, since these clients were least likely to have existing ties to local  		providers. </p>
<p>Some challenges, such as accessing transportation, are more acute in  		rural areas, and others, such as the risk of social isolation and finding  		physician services, are not specific to Rider participants or the CBA program.  		In general, community capacity for the provision of services to nursing  		facility residents moving back to the community likely contributes to some of  		the differences across regions in service use and in the number of transitions  		observed in this study.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Respondents reported finding reliable contractors for minor home  		  modifications and maintaining quality personal attendant services as the most  		  frequent challenges to a smooth transition.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certain services presented challenges in implementation. DADS  		caseworkers and home health agency representatives reported that finding  		reliable contractors for minor home modifications were the biggest challenges.  		In addition, a large majority of Rider participants rely on personal attendant  		services, and these services are a repeated source of problems due to no-shows  		and high turnover rates among personnel. These problems are not limited to the  		CBA program and not attributable to the Rider, but need to be resolved if the  		program is to function smoothly. </p>
<p><b><i>Nursing Facility Response to the Rider Initiative</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Facility participation is widespread. Transition volume at most  		  facilities is low.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facility participation in the initiative is widespread with transitions  		occurring in all regions and in both rural and urban areas, and in many  		different types of facilities. Transition volume at most facilities is fairly  		low. Over the three-year study period, a little more than one-third of  		participating facilities had only one or two transitions, while just under  		one-third had three to five transitions. The remaining third represented a  		range of Rider activity, including a few high volume facilities. </p>
<p>This study suggests that although the Rider is significant for  		individual participants, it is generally not a significant issue for nursing  		facilities generally. The total number of transitions across the state is small  		relative to the size of the nursing facility population, and the number from  		most individual facilities is small. Thus, the direct impact of the Rider  		initiative on nursing facility occupancy and the larger market for long-term  		care services, at the time of this study, was small. With the advent of a  		comprehensive MFP program in 2005 in Texas, the effect on nursing facilities  		can be expected to increase. The pace of transitions suggests that the changes  		will be incremental in nature, allowing the nursing facility market to adjust  		over time.</p>
<p><b><i>Quality Monitoring </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Quality monitoring under the Rider initiative occurs through the  		  community-based program in which they participate.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formal quality monitoring under the Rider follows the procedures in  		place for the waiver programs that the Rider participants enter. Under the CBA,  		the ISP is reviewed by the caseworker quarterly for appropriateness. DADS is  		responsible for monitoring the home health agencies, which are, in turn,  		responsible for monitoring the quality of care provided by their employees.  		Non-DADS personnel, such as the ombudsman and Meals-on-Wheels volunteers, also  		assist in quality monitoring, either formally or informally. Day-to-day quality  		issues are handled through standard DADS complaint procedures, which allow a  		client to contact their DADS caseworker to report problems. Some advocates and  		nursing facility personnel expressed discomfort at the lower level of  		regulation and supervision of assisted living facilities, where a large  		minority of Rider participants live, compared with nursing facilities or home  		health agencies. </p>
<p></p>
<h2 align="LEFT">FINDINGS: RIDER PARTICIPANTS AND COMPARISON GROUPS</h2>
<p><b><i>Characteristics of Rider Participants</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Although Rider participants represent a wide range of nursing  		  facility residents, certain characteristics are associated with a greater  		  likelihood of transition to the community under the Rider.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rider participants represent a wide range of nursing facility residents  		in all regions of the state and in both rural and urban areas as well as a wide  		range of types of disabilities and medical conditions. This breadth of  		participation suggests that the program has provided opportunities to return to  		the community for most types of clients.</p>
<p>Rider participants are predominantly elderly and female, reflecting the  		characteristics of nursing facility residents in general. Hispanics are  		slightly over-represented in the Rider population, while non-Hispanic Blacks  		are slightly under-represented as compared to the general nursing facility  		population. The average length of stay in the nursing facility prior to  		transition is over seven months, and more than one-third of Rider participants  		statewide have resided in the facility for six months or more. About one-third  		of Rider participants are classified as clinically stable with the highest  		level of functioning and lowest number of limitations in activities of daily  		living allowed under nursing facility Medicaid eligibility requirements.  		However, even those needing the most medical resources, such as individuals  		with quadriplegia or in a coma, are represented among participants. </p>
<p>Younger residents and those in urban counties are more likely to use the  		Rider than older residents and those residing in rural counties. Those with the  		lowest care dependence are somewhat over-represented among Rider participants  		relative to the nursing facility population. The percentage of older Rider  		participants with diagnosed dementia is far lower compared to nursing facility  		residents. A higher proportion of Rider participants have a diagnoses of stroke  		compared to nursing facility residents. </p>
<p><b><i>Participant Status After Entry into the CBA Program</i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Participation in the CBA program is relatively stable among Rider  		  participants. Over 70 percent are still receiving CBA services twelve months  		  after entry into the program.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over 80 percent of recipients in both the Rider and CBA populations  		remained in the CBA program in the sixth month after entry into CBA, though  		slightly fewer Rider participants than CBA clients were still in the program.  		The proportion remaining on CBA declines over time; nonetheless, 71 percent of  		Rider participants and 85 percent of CBA clients were still receiving CBA  		services through the twelfth month, which suggests that the CBA population  		overall is relatively stable. With a few exceptions and with consideration for  		omissions in the data, we found that the CBA program appears to be able to  		provide the opportunity for community living for a very wide range of  		recipients through the Rider, including those with mental health or behavioral  		issues and those requiring heavy care. Due to data limitations, no conclusions  		about hospitalization or mortality rates can be drawn from this study.</p>
<p>Overall, site visit informants evinced enthusiasm for the initiative.  		However, some informants noted that not all populations are equally well  		served. Informants identified clients with severe and persistent mental  		illness, clients with Alzheimers disease, and high-needs clients with  		physical disabilities as more difficult to transition. Respondents noted  		particularly that the lack of community systems to properly manage complex  		medication regimens for the severely mentally ill could be a precursor to  		return to a nursing facility for some participants. </p>
<p><b><i>Service Use </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>About one-third of Rider participants enter assisted living  		  facilities (ALFs), which affect overall patterns of service use. Assisted  		  living use varies widely across regions and participants level of care  		  dependence.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>About one-third of Rider participants enter ALFs, a rate five times  		higher than CBA clients. ALF use is twice as common in urban areas as in rural  		areas for Rider participants. Use of ALFs also varies by expected level of care  		need. About half of those with the lowest expected level of care needs are  		living in ALFs compared to 2 percent of those needing the highest level of care  		need. The share of both Rider participants and CBA clients with a nursing  		facility stay over the six-month period after CBA entry was low, regardless of  		assisted living facility use.</p>
<p>The difference in use of assisted living drives other observed  		differences in service use since the services included in the assisted package  		are not reimbursed separately. When service use is analyzed separately by  		assisted living status, there are few differences between the Rider and CBA  		groups in the proportion receiving each service.</p>
<p><b><i>Program Expenditures </i></b></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Rider participants incurred costs in the CBA program that were  		  about 10 percent higher than for non-Rider CBA clients, a difference driven in  		  part by higher use of assisted living but also higher average costs for  		  personal attendant services among those who did not use assisted living.  		  </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite differences in service mix between Rider participants and CBA  		clients, total average monthly program expenditures for all services appear to  		differ by about 10 percent--or $100 per client per month--with total  		expenditures of $1,143 per client per month for the Rider population compared  		with $1,043 for the CBA population. Analysis reveals higher average program  		expenditures for Rider participants across almost all subgroups, suggesting  		that no subgroup of Rider participants accounts for the observed difference.  		The difference in expenditures appears to be driven only in part by differences  		in the use of assisted living. The total average monthly program expenditures  		for ALF residents are higher than for non-ALF residents for both Rider  		participants and CBA clients, but a greater share of Rider participants enter  		assisted living. For recipients who do not use assisted living, Rider  		participants have a higher average cost for personal attendant services. In  		general, assisted living appears to be a nearly cost-neutral substitute for  		other CBA services.</p>
