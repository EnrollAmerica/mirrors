<h2>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Home health agencies serve patients with a range of health care needs  		including those with relatively short-term post acute care needs as well as  		individuals who are chronically ill and have more long-term needs. None of the  		12 quality measures Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently  		reports as part of the Home Health Quality Initiative (HHQI), however, is  		assessed and reported separately for clinically important subgroups of patients  		within the larger home health population. In contrast, all <i>nursing home</i>  		quality measures that CMS publicly reports are assessed separately for a  		nursing homes short-stay and long-stay residents. Because home health  		quality indicators are not reported separately for important subgroups of home  		health patients, risk-adjustment of HHQI outcomes takes on more importance.  		Without adequate risk-adjustment, public reporting could mislead consumers and  		be unfair to agencies admitting larger shares of patients who tend to do worse  		on some or all HHQI measures.</p>
<p>This project examines the current approach to public reporting of  		Medicare home health agency quality with a particular focus on how the current  		HHQI measures perform as quality indicators for the diverse home health  		population. Four key analytic questions are addressed: (1) Can clinically  		meaningful groups of home health patients be identified (e.g., post acute,  		chronically ill); (2) To what extent do agencies serve different types of  		patients; (3) Do these patient groups differ in publicly-reported outcomes; and  		(4) To what extent does risk-adjustment reduce (eliminate) any differences in  		outcomes. The project builds on an earlier Office of the Assistant Secretary  		for Planning and Evaluation-funded project where alternative risk-adjustment  		approaches were developed and tested to assess the quality of home health care.  		The results of the project are intended to help CMS and other Departmental  		agencies in their efforts to monitor and improve the quality of home health  		care. </p>
<p></p>
<h2> METHODS</h2>
<p>There were two major phases of data analysis: (1) preliminary analyses  		conducted using files available at the beginning of the project developed for  		earlier studies; and (2) final analyses conducted using a file constructed and  		delivered by the CMS Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) contractor  		at the University of Colorado to address the research questions specific to  		this project. A file that included all home health discharges, regardless of  		when they were admitted, was requested to assure full representation of short  		and long-stay Medicare and Medicaid home health patients. Long-stay patients  		are a group of particular interest since they are expected to be  		disproportionately individuals who are chronically ill and are likely to be  		underrepresented in HHQI analytic files. Two years of home health discharges  		were requested to address a second perceived limitation of HHQI. A substantial  		number of agencies care for relatively few Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries  		in a year and do not meet the minimum sample size requirements for reporting  		some or all of the publicly-reported outcomes. (Currently, outcomes are not  		publicly-reported when an agency has fewer than 20 home care episodes with the  		<i>potential</i> to have an outcome.) Two years of data were combined to  		minimize the number of agencies excluded from project analyses.</p>
<p>The CMS contractor at the University of Colorado drew the data from the  		OASIS National Repository at CMS. All OASIS discharge assessments in calendar  		years 2004 and 2005 were identified where there also was an admission (i.e.,  		Start of Care) OASIS assessment. The final analytic file includes a total of  		6,493,623 home health episodes with one of three types of OASIS discharges in  		2004 and 2005. Medicare and Medicaid provider numbers were used to identify the  		number discharges from the same agency during the two-year period and to link  		to the 2006 Provider of Services file to obtain information on agency  		characteristics.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Defining and Describing Different Types of Home Health  		Patients</h3>
<p>The types of patients served by home health agencies are not well  		defined but include individuals with short-term post acute care needs as well  		as chronically ill persons with long-term health care needs. We relied  		primarily on the literature and advice of clinical experts to develop an  		algorithm for identifying subgroups of the home health population that differ  		in: (1) whether they are post acute; and (2) whether they are chronically ill.  		Differences on these dimensions plausibly affect home health care needs and,  		more importantly for this project, home health outcomes. A small Technical  		Advisory Group reviewed the preliminary algorithm and distributional data, and  		suggested refinements in our approach.</p>
<p>Differences in the sociodemographic, payer and clinical characteristics  		of the patient groups were examined as part of the final analyses. No  		statistical tests of the significance of differences were estimated because we  		examined a census of all discharges during 2004 and 2005. In addition, given  		the very large number of observations, even trivial differences would be  		statistically significant. We focused instead on the magnitude of observed  		differences among the groups.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Analysis of Types of Patients Served by Home Health  		Agencies</h3>
<p>The agency is the unit of analysis when examining agency characteristics  		and the extent to which agencies serve different types of patients. There were  		a total of 8,094 agencies with at least one OASIS discharge in 2004 or 2005.  		All agencies were included in descriptive analyses of agency characteristics.  		We excluded agencies with too few discharges during the two-year study period  		to estimate reliable statistics (i.e., agencies with fewer than 100 discharges)  		when examining the extent to which agencies serve patients classified into the  		final five patient groups. The 6,113 agencies with 100 or more OASIS discharges  		in 2004 or 2005 represent agencies included in analyses of whether agencies  		serve different types of patients.</p>
<p>Whether agency characteristics differ by size was examined first. For  		this analysis we grouped all agencies (i.e., all 8,094 agencies with at least  		one OASIS discharge) into quintiles by size as measured by the number of OASIS  		discharges in 2004 and 2005 at each agency. Then, to determine whether agencies  		serve different types of patients, we examined the relative distribution of the  		five patient groups among agencies with at least 100 discharges (6,113  		agencies) that differ in size, ownership and geographic location. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Analysis of Performance of Publicly-Reported Quality  		Indicators</h3>
<p>The unit of analysis when examining the performance of the 12 HHQI  		measures was the home health episode. All discharges in the two-year period  		were included in these analyses. However, when determining the proportion of  		episodes improving in an HHQI quality measure, CMS excludes episodes that are  		not eligible to have a particular outcome. The criteria we used to evaluate  		each HHQI measure include: (1) the share of each patient group with the  		potential to have the outcome; (2) the extent to which each unadjusted outcome  		varied among the patient groups; and (3) the skewness of the quality indicator  		(i.e., whether a very high proportion of eligible episodes either had or did  		not have the outcome regardless of patient group).</p>
<p>The extent to which risk-adjustment reduced differences in unadjusted  		outcomes across the five patient groups then was examined. Logistic regression,  		the statistical method currently used by CMS to risk-adjust HHQI outcomes, was  		used to estimate risk-adjustment models for all 12 publicly-reported measures.  		The theory and evidence-based logistic regression models developed for  		risk-adjusting outcomes in the earlier project were employed here. For each  		outcome we estimated a <i>core model</i> with a common set of risk factors used  		to risk-adjust each HHQI quality measure, and then a <i>full model</i> where  		the common set of risk factors is supplemented by additional risk factors  		specific to each outcome. We also estimated a full risk-adjustment model for  		all outcomes that included as explanatory variables binary indicators defining  		the five patient groups. The magnitudes of the parameters for the patient group  		indicators are measures of potential bias in the risk-adjustment models.</p>
<p></p>
<h2> RESULTS</h2>
<h3 align="CENTER">Can Clinically Meaningful Groups of Patients Be  		Identified?</h3>
<p>The final algorithm classifies all home health episodes into five  		mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups based on OASIS data recorded at home  		health admission. The algorithm first divides episodes into those where  		patients have chronic conditions that are not well controlled in two or more  		body systems (i.e., clinically complex patients) versus all others.  		The algorithm then divides each of these two groups into: (1) post acute  		care admissions (i.e., patients with an inpatient stay in a hospital,  		inpatient rehabilitation facility, or skilled nursing facility (SNF) in the 14  		days prior to home health admission); and (2) all others (i.e.,  		community admissions). The post acute care group is further divided  		into: (1) restorative care admissions (i.e., patients with a  		surgical wound, a diagnosis of injury or trauma, or a surgical or orthopedic  		aftercare diagnosis); and (2) all others. </p>
<p>The five mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups are listed below with  		the percent of all episodes they represent and the average home health length  		of stay (LOS) for each group.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Community Admission: Clinically Complex</b> -- 8.8 percent of all  			 admissions and average LOS of 90.0 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Community Admission: Other</b> -- 21.7 percent of all admissions  			 and average LOS of 66.0 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Post Acute: Clinically Complex</b> -- 17.6 percent of all  			 admissions and average LOS of 58.7 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Post Acute: Restorative Care</b> -- 41.2 percent of all  			 admissions and average LOS of 40.1 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Post Acute: Other</b> -- 10.7 percent of all admissions and  			 average LOS of 55.4 days.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The five groups differed in the relative distribution of  		sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission as well as LOS and  		publicly-reported outcomes. The starkest difference among the five groups was  		between the clinically complex community admission and the  		post acute restorative care groups. Patients in the former group  		were much more likely to have sensory and communication impairments as well as  		cognitive deficits on admission relative to the latter group. The diagnostic  		profile of these two groups also differed markedly. Diabetes and hypertension  		were common problems among clinically complex community admissions and a  		significant minority had Alzheimers disease or other types of dementia.  		These diagnoses were reported far less often among patients in the post acute  		restorative care group. Instead, 42.2 percent had an orthopedic primary  		diagnosis that affected the score on the clinical dimension of the original  		Medicare prospective payment system (in place beginning in October 2000)  		including 29.1 percent with abnormal gait or other symptoms involving  		nervous and musculoskeletal systems. Given differences in clinical  		condition on admission it is not surprising that the mean LOS for clinically  		complex community admissions was over twice that of the post acute restorative  		care group (90.0 versus 40.1 days, respectively).</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">To What Extent Do Agencies Serve Different Types of  		Patients?</h3>
<p>We found considerable variation in patients served by agencies that  		differ in size, ownership, control and geographic location. Perhaps the most  		surprising result is the strong relationship between agency size and the  		relative share of two of the five types of patients served. Specifically, as  		agency size increased, the proportion of clinically complex community  		admissions typically decreased and the proportion of post acute restorative  		care admissions increased. We also found that hospital-based agencies were more  		likely to care for post acute home health patients -- in particular, post acute  		restorative care patients -- relative to other agencies, and that for-profit  		agencies were more likely to serve community admissions compared to other  		agencies.</p>
<p>Large differences also were found in the relative distribution of the  		five types of patients among the nine Census divisions. It is possible that  		some of this variation reflects differences in the Medicare and Medicaid  		populations in different areas of the country. However, the magnitude of some  		of the differences (e.g., the three-fold difference between the New England and  		West South Central Divisions in the share of clinically complex community  		admissions) suggests other factors may contribute to these differences. These  		could include differences in home health agency characteristics, variation in  		the supply of other types of providers that are potential substitutes for home  		health care (e.g., SNFs), differences in physician practice patterns, and  		differences in how OASIS fields used to define patient groups (e.g., admission  		diagnoses and their severity) are recorded.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Do the Five Patient Groups Differ in Publicly-Reported  		Outcomes?</h3>
<p>The share of each groups discharges that had the potential to have  		the 12 HHQI outcomes varied substantially; however, at least half of the  		discharges in each group had the potential to have most outcomes. The magnitude  		of differences in <i>unadjusted </i>health status outcomes among the five  		patient groups was more than 20 percentage points in some cases. The post acute  		restorative care group had the best outcome on all eight of the health status  		quality indicators (i.e., the largest percent improving among those eligible to  		improve) while the two community admission groups had the worst outcomes. The  		generally worse clinical condition on admission of the individuals in the two  		community admission groups, relative to the post acute restorative care group,  		clearly appears to affect their rate of improvement over the course of the home  		health episode.</p>
<p>The percent of episodes with the three utilization outcomes, as well as  		the one adverse event outcome were highly skewed across all groups. Less than  		10 percent of all admissions were hospitalized, received emergent care for any  		reason, or emergent care for a wound infection; while over 95 percent were  		discharge to the community. This result partly reflects the approach we chose  		to defining home health episodes relative to the approach used to by CMS to  		define episodes for public reporting of home health quality. In any case, while  		the magnitude of the utilization outcomes that we report is not large for  		hospitalization or emergent care, the relative differences among the groups  		were substantial. The highest rates of hospitalization and emergent care were  		found among two of the three post acute care groups (i.e., the clinically  		complex and the other groups) while the lowest and second lowest  		rates of hospitalization and emergent care, respectively, were among post acute  		restorative care admissions. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER">To What Extent Does Risk-Adjustment Reduce Differences  		in Outcomes?</h3>
<p>Models developed in an earlier project were employed in this project to  		estimate risk-adjustment models for the 12 HHQI outcomes. We found that the  		risk-adjusted outcomes were remarkably similar to the unadjusted outcomes  		regardless of group suggesting that risk-adjustment at the aggregate level is  		good. This is not surprising for the HHQI outcomes where the summary statistics  		for the risk-adjustment models indeed were good. It is more surprising for  		outcomes where the summary statistics for the risk-adjustment models were  		mediocre to poor. The <i>unadjusted</i> outcomes for the latter group, however,  		generally do not vary as much across the five patient groups; weak  		risk-adjustment is likely to result in risk-adjusted values close to the  		overall mean which will not differ that much from unadjusted values.</p>
<p>The potential for bias in the risk-adjustment models, at the same time,  		was found to be substantial although the actual bias at the <i>aggregate</i>  		level does not appear to be large. Nevertheless, the direction of the bias is  		of concern. In particular, agencies admitting a relatively large share of  		community admission could have publicly-reported health status outcomes that  		are too low (i.e., the adjusted proportion improving is under-reported), while  		agencies that admit a relatively large share of post acute restorative care  		patients could have publicly-reported outcomes that are too high. Risk-adjusted  		utilization outcomes also appear to favor agencies admitting a relatively large  		share of post acute restorative care patients. An analysis of individual agency  		outcomes, which is beyond the scope of this project, is required to better  		understand the extent of bias and impact on actual agency outcomes and  		rankings. </p>
<p></p>
<h2> CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>The results raise the possibility that HHQI is unfair to agencies  		admitting a relatively large share of patients who tend to have worse outcomes.  		In particular, agencies with a relatively large share of clinically complex  		community admissions could be disadvantaged relative to agencies serving a  		relatively large share of post acute restorative care patients. Because there  		are differences in the types of patients served by agencies that vary in size,  		ownership and geographic location, some of the differences in outcomes observed  		across the five patient groups could be caused by systematic differences in the  		quality of care provided by different types of agencies. It seems more likely,  		however, that important risk-adjusters are omitted from current models.</p>
<p>There are two straightforward approaches to improving current  		risk-adjustment, each having important drawbacks. One approach is to separately  		risk-adjust and report outcomes for the patient groups developed here or other  		groupings of chronically ill and post acute home health patients. This would  		permit comparison of the quality of care provided to important subgroups of  		patients across different agencies. As noted above, CMS currently assesses  		publicly-reported nursing home quality indicators separately for a nursing  		homes short-stay and long-stay residents although there is only limited  		risk-adjustment that mainly is operationalized through exclusion rules (Mukamel  		et al., 2008). The major drawback of separately risk-adjusting and reporting  		outcomes for subgroups of home health patients is that far fewer agencies than  		currently is the case would have the minimum number of episodes with the  		potential to have HHQI outcomes (i.e., 20 episodes).</p>
<p>The other approach is to estimate models that allow risk-adjusters to  		vary in their effect on outcomes depending on key measures defining patient  		groups (e.g., community versus post acute admission). The drawback to  		developing risk-adjustment models that include interaction terms is that the  		substantial increase in the complexity of the models limits the ability of  		providers and consumers to understand risk-adjustment. This may undermine trust  		in and support for risk-adjusting patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Before exploring alternative approaches to risk-adjustment, however, we  		strongly recommend that analyses be conducted at the agency level. More work is  		needed to understand the extent and impact of bias in risk-adjusted outcomes at  		the agency level as well as the relationship among agency and geographic  		factors, the types of individuals served, and patient outcomes. While the  		risk-adjustment models currently used by CMS are likely to produce results  		similar to those reported here, this also should be evaluated at the agency  		level.</p>
<p>Project results provide important insights into the types of patients  		served by home health agencies and differences in their outcomes on  		publicly-reported measures. Multiple chronic conditions, as in other health  		care settings, were found to be important contributors to outcomes. Given the  		limitations of current reporting of medical conditions on OASIS, new ways of  		insuring better information about chronic conditions need to be developed to  		improve patient care and the risk-adjustment of outcomes. While many questions  		remain to be answered, the findings from this project in several areas provide  		critical information needed by the Department in its efforts to assess and  		improve the quality of care provided to the diverse home health population.</p>
