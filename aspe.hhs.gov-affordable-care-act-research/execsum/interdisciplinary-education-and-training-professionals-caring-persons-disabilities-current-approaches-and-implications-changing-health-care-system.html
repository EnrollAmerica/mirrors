<hr /><h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Center for Health Policy Research of The George Washington  		University Medical Center conducted a project to examine innovative and  		interdisciplinary education and training programs for professionals serving  		people with disabilities under a contract from the Office of Disability, Aging  		and Long-Term Care Policy (ODALTCP), Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The  		Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy is particularly  		interested in the development of effective "systems" of care for persons with  		disabilities across the life span; if such coordinated systems of care are to  		be achieved, training of providers of services is a key issue from both policy  		and program implementation perspectives. Providers of services to persons with  		disabilities must be knowledgeable about the range of service needs of their  		clients, about the abilities of various disciplines to best provide those  		services, and with regard to how professionals from an array of disciplines can  		work together to achieve a coordinated system of care that meets those needs.  		Such issues may be particularly relevant within the rapidly changing context of  		a health care environment which places a growing emphasis on managed care and  		capitated financing mechanisms. People with disabilities of all kinds are  		increasingly likely to be faced with participation in a managed care system for  		receipt of at least some of the services they require to lead healthy,  		independent and productive lives.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the project was to identify innovative and  		interdisciplinary education and training programs for professionals caring for  		persons with disabilities, and through case studies of these programs, describe  		how students and working professionals are trained regarding the needs of  		persons with disabilities, and how settings and programs are organized to  		encourage interdisciplinary and integrated approaches in education and  		training. The project was to focus on the unique aspects of training in an  		interdisciplinary environment.</p>
<p>The full report is presented in three sections. Part I is the Summary  		Report. This part presents the project goals and methodology; a brief overview  		of the demographics of disability; and trends in service delivery for persons  		with disability, including managed health care. Concepts and approaches to  		interdisciplinary education and training are reviewed, as are examples of how  		these approaches have been integrated into the education and training of  		professionals to serve persons with disabilities. The findings presented are  		based upon information gathered through the case studies and literature review.  		Conclusions are the interpretations of project staff, based on their analysis.  		Finally, a series of recommendations is offered.</p>
<p>Part II presents nine case studies of education and training programs  		which take interdisciplinary approaches to preparing professionals to serve  		persons with disabilities. The case studies present both objective information  		concerning the structure and implementation of the programs, as well as the  		subjective observations of those individuals involved in planning, implementing  		or participating in the programs. Interviews were conducted with professionals  		from various disciplines involved with each program, students and other  		trainees, representatives of community-based organizations involved in the  		training programs, and where possible, individuals with disabilities, parents  		or other family members linked to the programs.</p>
<p>Part III is a review of the literature as it specifically pertains to  		interdisciplinary education and training of professionals to serve persons with  		disabilities.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Study Methodology</h3>
<p>The scope of the project included convening a Technical Advisory Group,  		conducting a literature review, nine case studies (six conducted by site  		visits; three by telephone interviews) and this final report. The project team  		consisted of health services researchers from the Center for Health Policy  		Research and faculty members from the Departments of Health Care Sciences and  		Neurology of The George Washington University Medical Center.</p>
<p>Parameters to guide the nine site selections and the scope of the  		literature review were developed in consultation with the Technical Advisory  		Group. The initial criteria employed required that the sites: 1) be targeted  		explicitly to persons with disabilities; 2) employ a coordinated  		interdisciplinary team approach; and 3) include a focus on comprehensive  		community-based services. Beyond the initial criteria, an attempt was made to  		include programs from a broad array based on:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>age of the primary target populations to be served by the  			 professionals trained by the program, ie. 1) infants, children and adolescents  			 with disabilities, 2) working age adults with disabilities, and 3) the frail  			 elderly;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>differing types of disabilities represented in the target  			 populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programs that are university-based, community-based, or a  			 combination of the two;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programs doing preservice training, inservice training, or a  			 combination; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programs that could represent a range of potentially relevant  			 training models--formal and less formal, programs adapting more traditional  			 approaches and those taking new approaches.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An attempt was made to include sites that represent an array of  		approaches, differing target populations, a variety of organizational  		structures, and potentially interesting and useful perspectives on  		interdisciplinary training in the changing health care environment.</p>
<p>Broad research questions included the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How is an <i>interdisciplinary approach</i> to professional  			 education and training being implemented to meet the range of service needs of  			 persons with disabilities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there <i>unique considerations</i> to be taken into account when  			 training professionals to function as members of interdisciplinary teams to  			 provide services to persons with disabilities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What has been the experience of the program in training  			 professionals to function effectively to provide services to persons with  			 disabilities in an interdisciplinary manner at the <i>community</i>  			 level?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is the training program addressing the delivery of services to  			 persons with disabilities within the growing environment of <i>managed  			 care</i>?</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Demographics of Disability</h3>
<p>Most Americans will experience disability at some point during their  		lives, either themselves or within their families. Some 49 million  		non-institutionalized Americans have disabling conditions that interfere with  		their life's activities; the other 200 million Americans can expect to  		experience a disabling condition at some point in their lives. The demographics  		of disability illustrate this point:</p>
<p>More than nine million people have physical or mental conditions that  		keep them from being able to work, attend school, or maintain a household;</p>
<ul><li>
<p>more than half of the 4-year increase in life expectancy between  			 1970 and 1987 is accounted for by time spent with activity  			 limitations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>disabilities are disproportionately represented among minorities,  			 the elderly, and lower socioeconomic populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the current 75-year life expectancy, a newborn can be expected to  			 experience an average of 13 years with an activity limitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual disability-related costs to the nation total more than $170  			 billion.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Although the percentage of people with a disability increases with age,  		disability is found throughout the age spectrum. Furthermore, at different ages  		the nature of the conditions that cause disability varies. For example, for  		younger adults disability is more likely due to mobility limitations resulting  		from spinal cord injuries, orthopedic impairments, and paralysis, whereas for  		older adults, chronic diseases predominate as causes of limitations. A  		significant trend with implications for service providers and their training  		needs is the growing number of people with a wide array of significant  		physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities that are living and participating  		in the community.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Trends in Service Delivery for Persons with  		Disabilities</h3>
<p>Several notable trends have relevance for the education and training of  		providers of acute and long-term services. Perhaps the trend with the most  		far-reaching implications has been the disability rights movement, which,  		according to a recent report from the National Council on Disability, has made  		steady progress in the last decade in empowering people with disabilities to  		achieve the goals of equality of opportunity, full participation, independent  		living, and economic self-sufficiency. As more and more persons with  		disabilities of varying severity are integrated into the community, they  		require health care and related services that are accessible and that support  		their inclusion. This has been accompanied by increasing advocacy for the  		"demedicalization" of certain services, especially those required for long-term  		support.</p>
<p>Dramatically increasing numbers of Americans are receiving medical and  		health-related services through managed care arrangements which involve some  		degree of "gate-keeping" or case management, an emphasis on primary care,  		restrictions on provider choice, and which may or may not be financed in a  		prepaid, capitated manner. By the end of 1993, more than 44 million people were  		enrolled in 566 health maintenance organizations and an additional 55 million  		in preferred provided organizations. More and more, privately-insured persons  		with chronic illnesses and disabilities, and those who will develop disabling  		conditions, will be receiving their health care under some sort of managed care  		arrangement.</p>
<p>The managed care phenomenon is not limited to the privately insured. By  		1995, nearly one in four Medicaid beneficiaries--7.8 million persons--were  		receiving their health care through a managed care arrangement. Currently, some  		32 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are covered under managed care risk  		contracts.</p>
<p>Persons with developmental disabilities have traditionally received  		long-term care in institutional settings; recently, however, states have begun  		to significantly expand their use of Medicaid 1915c home and community-based  		waivers, enacted by Congress in 1981, to provide alternatives to institutional  		care for this population. While increasing the number of persons whose  		long-term care is financed by Medicaid, the waiver program permits states to  		meet the needs of many persons with developmental disabilities by offering them  		a broader range of services in less restrictive settings such as group or  		family home, rather than institutions.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the General Accounting Office, few  		states have significant experience with prepaid care for beneficiaries who  		qualify for Medicaid on the basis of disability. While states can make prepaid  		managed care plans available for Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to enroll,  		federal waivers of Medicaid rules are necessary before a state can require such  		enrollment or restrict individuals to specific plans. Increasingly  		states--motivated by the fact that Medicaid beneficiaries with disabilities  		account for only about 15 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries but over  		one-third of all Medicaid expenditures--are directing more attention to using  		managed care for this population.</p>
<p>The Medicare program provides health care coverage for almost all  		persons over age 65, as well as persons under age 65 who are receiving cash  		benefits on the basis of disability, or who have end-stage renal disease. In  		1996, Medicare Part A hospital insurance will cover an estimated 37.5 million  		aged and disabled persons. Although still fundamentally a fee-for-service (FFS)  		system, in 1983 Congress authorized payment to qualified "risk contract" health  		maintenance organizations (HMOs) to enroll Medicare beneficiaries. Today,  		approximately 10 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs, and a  		variety of legislative proposals in Congress aim to expand the managed care  		options available to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the overall percentage  		of Medicare beneficiaries in managed care plans.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Interdisciplinary Service Delivery</h3>
<p>Interdisciplinary service delivery models have appeared in the social  		services and health-related literature for several decades, but it is generally  		conceded that a gap has existed between the conceptualization of<i>  		inter</i>disciplinary service delivery, as opposed to the  		<i>multi</i>disciplinary model more prevalent in practice, and its actual  		implementation. Many authors have offered definitions of interdisciplinary  		service delivery, which share common elements including: cooperation and  		collaboration among professionals of different disciplines, coordination,  		communication, a collective team identity that supersedes individual  		disciplines, an interactive process, and client-centered goals.</p>
<p>A team approach to assessment and to the delivery of services has been  		advocated as especially advantageous for providers of care to persons with  		disabilities. Specific skills that are considered important in making decisions  		in the context of interdisciplinary practice include identifying and  		prioritizing problems, information gathering and sharing, generating and  		evaluating solutions, moving toward consensus, and implementing and evaluating  		decisions. Additional personal and professional skills desirable in team  		members include the ability to listen, to trust, to be open, and to communicate  		clearly and effectively, as well as a willingness to give feedback, to live  		with uncertainty and ambiguity, to take personal and professional risks, and to  		share power and expertise.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Interdisciplinary Training</h3>
<p>Interdisciplinary team training can be broadly defined as the education  		and training of an array of professionals from different disciplines in the  		provision of coordinated services by an integrated team of professionals. A key  		element of interdisciplinary training is conveying an understanding and  		appreciation of the unique perspectives, knowledge, skills, values, and  		purposes of each of the professions represented on the team. A defining  		characteristic of training is learning how to work interdependently and  		collaboratively with other members of the team.</p>
<p>The Pew Health Professions Commission has identified some of the  		advantages of the interdisciplinary approach to training for both students and  		educators as: giving trainees the opportunity to study multiple health care  		paradigms; fostering appreciation and understanding of other disciplines;  		allowing students to model strategies for future practice; promoting and  		fostering participation by students from each of the disciplines involved; and,  		by challenging the norms and values of each of the disciplines, making students  		and educators more aware of their own, as well as those of their  		colleagues.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary education and training of professionals to serve  		people with disabilities is the particular knowledge base, systems and  		professional disciplines involved. The goal of such training is to develop the  		trainees' capacity for interdisciplinary collaboration and to form teams around  		the needs of clients and populations being served. From this standpoint,  		"interdisciplinary" is a function of content of the curriculum and how the  		content of the curriculum is delivered; it is not necessarily dependent on  		whether the learner group itself consists of more than one discipline. Others  		take a more service-oriented approach, and believe that interdisciplinary  		education and training should reflect the service delivery model, with  		interdisciplinary team assessments and collaboration as the sine quo non of  		interdisciplinary training. Under this approach, training would incorporate  		multiple disciplines into the structure and content of the training program  		itself, training a variety of disciplines together.</p>
<p>The provision of early intervention services for infants, toddlers and  		young children with disabilities or at-risk for disabilities has created a  		focus on interdisciplinary service delivery and interdisciplinary personnel  		preparation of professionals serving this age group. The early intervention  		field has promoted the concepts of family-centered care, family-professional  		collaboration, and culturally-appropriate care, in some cases leading to the  		incorporation of family members as participants in the interdisciplinary  		training of professionals.</p>
<p>The field of medical rehabilitation is the field most closely identified  		with the care of working age adults with disabilities that are of acute or  		sudden onset, such as those that are trauma-related, as opposed to more  		chronic, insidious conditions, for instance, multiple sclerosis.  		Interdisciplinary care--the "team approach"--has been a key part of the  		traditional, in-patient medical rehabilitation culture. In 1992, however, the  		American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine recognized a lack of formalized  		training in interdisciplinary team functioning that "is significant in that  		failure to acquire skills needed to work in an interdisciplinary fashion can  		affect patient care outcomes negatively and have an adverse impact on the  		rehabilitation effort." Residents in rehab medicine and other health  		professionals working in rehab medicine training facilities--nurse specialists,  		physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech/language pathologists,  		social workers--are "<i>immersed</i>" in the interdisciplinary service model,  		which they learn "<i>through an acculturation process</i>" that is very  		strong.</p>
<p>In the field of mental health, there has been some recognition that  		serious mental illness and substance abuse are so complicated that they reach  		beyond the purview of any one discipline. It should be noted though that some  		current practices in parallel training of professionals in these fields impede  		taking a collaborative approach to service delivery.</p>
<p>The current aging of the population has drawn increased attention on the  		care of the frail elderly. A recent review of the state-of-the-art in geriatric  		medicine points out that the goal of care of the older adult is to prevent or  		reduce disability. It is also noted that the concept of continuity of care, in  		which patients are continuously reassessed, is emerging as an important issue  		in the care of older adults. Another trend has been the provision of assessment  		and continuing care in the home setting, rather than in the hospital or nursing  		home. These trends all have implications for the training of providers of  		services to the elderly with disabilities or at-risk for disabilities. In  		addition to the frail elderly, the aging of the population of adults with  		developmental disabilities has created a sub-population of elderly persons with  		unique functional, social, emotional, and physical needs.</p>
<p>Across professional fields and ages of clients and patients served, it  		has been noted that one factor hindering interdisciplinary education in  		academic settings is the lack of qualified faculty, as well as a lack of  		appropriate role models for students who actually practice interdisciplinary  		care in clinical training sites.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>FINDING </h2>
<p>The nine site studies (see <a href="interdisciplinary-education-and-training-professionals-caring-persons-disabilities-current-approaches-and-implications-changing-health-care-system.html#TABLE">Table</a>) detail what  		programs are doing regarding interdisciplinary training, how they are going  		about doing it, as well as the perspectives and opinions of those involved  		regarding issues faced by the programs, specifically, and by interdisciplinary  		education, generally. The site studies present a rich source of information  		about interdisciplinary education and training with a disability focus.  		Similarities, differences, and "lessons learned" can be compared and contrasted  		among the nine programs along many different dimensions. Several of these are  		highlighted in this section. The reader is referred to the site studies  		themselves for more detailed information. Some of these programs are  		longstanding; others have begun only recently. All are continuing to evolve.  		Some have their base in an academic institution, where they contrast with the  		more traditional, and often more established and predominant, unidisciplinary  		training programs. A number of training programs have grown out of successful  		service models, and these present unique challenges. Many programs, while  		concentrating on either the preservice preparation of professionals or outreach  		to practicing professionals, do both; in either case, there is an increasing  		recognition that today's training must have a strong community-based component.  		In most cases, there is a recognition that education and training programs must  		continually evolve if they are to continue to produce professionals who can  		successfully meet the needs of persons with disabilities while responding to  		the challenges of a health care system that is in flux.</p>
<p>The nine programs vary considerably with regard to objectives, scope,  		target populations of individuals with disabilities to be served by the  		professionals trained by the programs, and on other parameters; this reflects  		the lack of consensus to date on any one or several models of interdisciplinary  		education and training. Interdisciplinary education and training is still in  		its infancy. Nonetheless, the programs also demonstrate a number of  		similarities, both in terms of components and structure of the programs and the  		competencies being conveyed, as well as regarding the issues, facilitating  		factors, and barriers which the various programs have faced or continue to  		face.</p>
<p>There is unanimity among the programs concerning the value of  		interdisciplinary training for professionals serving people with disabilities  		of different ages, with different types of disabilities, and with differing  		functional capacities and service requirements. At the core of these  		interdisciplinary training programs is the realization that providing services  		to people with chronic illnesses and disabilities, many of whom have complex  		conditions and functional limitations, cannot be done appropriately by one  		discipline alone. To help the consumer/client/patient and their family access  		and utilize an array of necessary services in an efficient and effective manner  		requires a coordinated effort among several disciplines. It is also emphasized  		that such a "team" effort does not come naturally, but requires education and  		training to develop specific knowledge and skills necessary to function as a  		team.</p>
<p>The nine programs represent a complete spectrum in the degree to which  		managed health care is addressed by the content of the curriculum or other  		educational components of each program. At one end of the spectrum is the On  		Lok program, in which service delivery and training actually take place within  		a framework that is totally based on a managed care model in which On Lok is  		fully responsible for the health and social needs of its clients. Staff and  		trainees learn to appreciate the ability to balance participant care demands  		for an array of services with the human capital and organizational resources  		required to meet those needs. But this "<i>full immersion</i>" model is  		unusual. Other training programs have only begun to address managed care as it  		affects professionals serving people with disabilities. At the Seattle program,  		the core seminar series for all trainees covers some managed care issues, and  		the realities of managed care for individual clients are discussed more and  		more in case conferences. There is evidence that managed care organizations  		themselves are beginning to look at the training needs of their own providers  		related to interdisciplinary team service delivery and even with regards to  		serving populations of persons with disabilities. The Henry Ford Health System,  		a large, vertically integrated health care delivery system that provides both  		primary and specialty care in the Detroit area, has been a leader in this  		area.</p>
<p>Most of the training programs studied are grappling with the changing  		delivery systems that have resulted from the growing prevalence of managed and  		capitated care. Although for a few of these programs the discussion is removed  		from their related delivery of services, for most the realities of managed care  		mean preparing professionals to work in an environment where fewer patients are  		referred for specialized services, and resources are tightly controlled. At one  		program, managed care has had very different effects on the two "<i>core</i>"  		clinics where much of the training takes place. One clinic, which serves  		children with very complex needs, has not seemed to be affected to a great  		extent; however, another, which does follow-up of high risk infants, has been  		"<i>devastated</i>." Other programs have been similarly affected; at one  		program based in a rehabilitation hospital, the penetration of managed care is  		adversely impacting the patient pool, while many of the patients who do come  		often have their care very tightly monitored by their managed care plan.</p>
<p>The perceptions of individuals associated with these programs vary. One  		faculty member believes that "<i>managed care is threatening training</i>";  		training more and more has to be measured against some sort of "<i>efficiency  		stick</i>" that may not take into account the complexity of the clients being  		served. An associate of another program expressed the uncertainty many feel in  		the face of managed care. Noting that many of the services needed by people  		with disabilities or at-risk--social services, early childhood education,  		nutrition, assistive technology--are not viewed as "health" services by some,  		and not usually reimbursable, managed care organizations may not feel they  		should be concerned that their clients receive such services. On the other  		hand, if managed care evolves into a more "<i>consumer-driven</i>" system, then  		there may be more opportunities for interdisciplinary service delivery.  		"<i>More and more, with managed care, the issue is--you get what you  		need</i>."</p>
<p>Adequate funding is critical to support interdisciplinary education.  		According to one faculty member, "<i>Just keeping the interdisciplinary process  		functioning takes an incredible amount of energy and time</i>." The source,  		scope and duration of funding offers a great deal of insight into a program's  		capacity to build and sustain an interdisciplinary training program. Funding  		sources for training have a significant impact on the degree of structure and  		formality of interdisciplinary training programs. Programs that have  		<i>dedicated</i> sources of funding tended to have more formalized curricula  		and program infrastructure. Within programs that had some dedicated, some  		non-dedicated training funding, the dichotomy was evident.</p>
<p>Some of the programs studied had no dedicated source of revenue to  		conduct training. These programs relied upon the financial resources provided  		by their service delivery component. In some instances, the programs were state  		or county institutions, dependent on public revenues. Others received third  		party reimbursement including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. In the  		case of On Lok, the program receives capitated payments for service delivery  		under Medicare and Medicaid waivers, as well as some private insurance  		capitated reimbursement.</p>
<p>Some interdisciplinary programs stressed the importance of financial  		support for trainees. According to one program director, "<i>Stipends can  		solidify a training program, but the funding is not always available</i>."  		Without stipends, an interdisciplinary program may have to rely on trainees  		being carried through their home academic department; in such a case, the  		interdisciplinary program may lose control of trainees' time for educational  		experiences, impacting the overall interdisciplinary educational  		experience.</p>
<p>Most of the programs studied are fundamentally rooted in the notion that  		exemplary service delivery programs are the base for exemplary education and  		training. Some programs, like Wisconsin's PACT, began with service delivery as  		their primary mission, from which the educational component evolved. Others,  		such as Craig Hospital in Colorado, continue to see their primary mission as  		service delivery, although a significant amount of training takes place. On  		Lok, which began in 1973 as the first adult day health center for frail  		elderly, began providing training to students and professionals in the early  		1980s, and its education component continues to expand and evolve. Likewise,  		although both the service delivery and educational components are new, the  		Health and Education Collaboration Project in Hawaii was basically added on to  		the service delivery component of the Healthy and Ready to Learn Center.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<table border="BORDER"><tr><td><b>A new generation of service providers is needed who view service  			 delivery as grounded in the interdisciplinary process to promote effective,  			 efficient and quality care while assisting persons with disabilities of all  			 ages and their families to access the services they need to live healthy,  			 productive and fully integrated lives in their communities.

</tr></table><p>The primary focus for professional training and service delivery is to  		meet the clients' needs. There is increasing consensus that, in many cases,  		this cannot be done effectively and efficiently by one discipline alone. While  		not every client may require assessment and service delivery by a "team" as  		such, it is evident that professionals from different disciplines and working  		in different "systems" will more and more be called upon to work interactively  		with one another and with the client with a chronic illness or disability and  		his/her family members and associates.</p>
<table border="BORDER"><tr><td><b>If education and training is, indeed, the "third leg" of managed  			 care, then, at least as far as it pertains to serving persons with  			 disabilities, managed care could be building on a precarious base.</b></td>
</tr></table><p>While many excellent academic and community-based programs are training  		providers to serve persons with disabilities, it appears that, in many  		instances, issues specifically pertaining to managed care are being addressed  		only peripherally by curricula, and opportunities for trainees and students to  		learn and practice interdisciplinary skills and disability-specific content  		within a managed care context are limited. It is also quite likely that, to a  		large extent, managed care organizations have little appreciation for the  		specific knowledge, attitudes and skills needed by providers to appropriately  		serve people with disabilities.</p>

<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
<p>The following recommendations are offered to address the needs to expand  		the scope of interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for  		professionals serving persons with disabilities, and to ensure that the content  		of such education and training is relevant to the on-going changes in health  		care and other systems affecting the delivery of services to persons with  		disabilities.</p>
<table border="BORDER" align="CENTER"><tr align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><td align="CENTER"><b>Promote linkage</b></td>
</tr></table><p>Promote opportunities for continuing dialogue between managed care  		organizations and their representatives and persons with disabilities, the  		professionals who serve them, and those educating and training the next  		generation of service providers or re-training current providers. Such a  		dialogue will be critical to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>inform managed care of the service needs of persons with  			 disabilities and the variety of ways in which these service needs can be  			 met;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inform managed care about the competencies needed by professionals  			 serving persons with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inform persons with disabilities, providers and educators/trainers  			 about managed care and its potential to help meet the service needs of persons  			 with disabilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote the establishment of critical linkages between  			 academic/community-based education and training programs and managed care  			 organizations that will result in new and innovative approaches to professional  			 training that incorporate the rich tradition of interdisciplinary training in  			 the disability field with the new realities and potential promise of managed  			 care.</p>
</li>
</ul><table border="BORDER" align="CENTER"><tr><td align="CENTER"><b>Create incentives</b></td>
</tr></table><p>Create incentives, through established mechanisms and programs  		supporting professional education and training or through new initiatives,  		to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>encourage the establishment of linkages between  			 academic/community-based professional education and training programs and  			 managed care organizations to enhance preservice and inservice education and  			 training of providers serving persons with disabilities and to enhance the  			 provision of services to people with disabilities under managed care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote further integration of academic-based education and training  			 programs with community-based organizations and providers to 1) enhance  			 preservice training by increasing opportunities for community-based  			 experiential learning, and 2) enhance inservice, continuing education of  			 professionals already working in the community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>facilitate linkages between innovative community-initiated education  			 and training programs and academic institutions with a similar mission 1) to  			 enhance preservice training, ensure a stream of preservice trainees for the  			 community-based training programs, and enhance the long-term viability of  			 community-based training programs, and 2) to increase the transfer and  			 incorporation of innovative, community-based approaches to training into  			 academic curricula; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foster and facilitate the wider incorporation of interdisciplinary  			 approaches to education and training by institutions of higher education into  			 curricula at all levels --undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate--with a  			 special emphasis on exposing students to interdisciplinary concepts, approaches  			 and experiences early in their educational experience.</p>
</li>
</ul><table border="BORDER" align="CENTER"><tr><td align="CENTER"><b>Support research</b></td>
</tr></table><p>Support research to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>investigate the causal connections between interdisciplinary  			 professional education and training, interdisciplinary provision of services,  			 access to care, quality of care, and positive outcomes for persons with  			 disabilities. This research should focus on different models of  			 interdisciplinary education and training and different models of  			 interdisciplinary provision of services for persons with disabilities within  			 the context of managed care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further the understanding of the pedagogy of interdisciplinary team  			 training and to develop outcomes measurements for interdisciplinary training in  			 order to help determine the effectiveness, and ultimately the efficiency, of  			 such training models; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investigate options and incentives for private sector and public  			 sector funding of interdisciplinary professional education, and mechanisms for  			 how funding mechanisms could leverage interdisciplinary training programs. This  			 would contribute to the broader context of policy discussions and options  			 regarding the future course of Graduate Medical Education.</p>
</li>
</ul><table border="BORDER" align="CENTER"><tr><td align="CENTER"><b>Disseminate information</b></td>
</tr></table><p>Partner with appropriate players in the field (institutions of higher  		education, managed care organizations, community based organizations) to  		disseminate information regarding:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>interdisciplinary curricula and approaches;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>innovative use of community sites for training by academic-based  			 programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>community-initiated and community-based education and training  			 programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>linkages between education and training programs based in academic  			 institutions and those based in the community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how managed care issues can be infused into curricula and other  			 components of training;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>innovative models of education and training that link managed care  			 organizations, academic institutions, community-based providers, and persons  			 with disabilities and their families; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sources of funding to support interdisciplinary training.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It will be important to ensure that information is disseminated across  		different sectors serving different populations of persons with disabilities  		and training different disciplines. For example, models and experience gained  		by educators and practitioners in the fields of geriatrics and gerontology  		could inform those working in programs serving other age groups, such as  		rehabilitation or early intervention, and other conditions, such as  		developmental disabilities or the sequelae of trauma. Building on the case  		studies presented in this report, it has been suggested that HHS consider the  		development and dissemination of "how-to" manuals addressing steps to implement  		interdisciplinary education and training programs based on the experiences of  		innovative and successful programs. It has also been suggested that there is a  		need to foster the development of software for training and to foster  		communication among team members.</p>
