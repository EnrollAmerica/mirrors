<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Family caregivers -- including relatives, friends, neighbors, and others  		who provide unpaid support -- perform immensely valuable work, helping older  		adults with chronic disabilities get the help they need at home, rather than  		entering a facility. Recently, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) funded a study that combined 2004 National Long  		Term Care Survey Caregiver Supplement data with Minimum Data Set (MDS) data to  		examine the impacts of caregiver stress on nursing home use (Spillman &amp;  		Long, 2009). Results showed that caregiver stress was the most powerful  		predictor of an extended nursing home stay, accounting for about a quarter of  		nursing home entries from the community.</p>
<p>Of the dimensions of caregiver stress, physical strain followed by  		financial hardship, was the most powerful predictor -- higher than emotional  		stress or social constraints. Nearly a third (31%) of caregivers reported that  		caregiving is a physical strain. Caregivers interviewed for the survey  		indicated that physical strain from activities such as lifting and transferring  		was a big problem for them. In addition, over 50% of the caregivers surveyed  		were over the age of 65, which raises their risk of physical strain when they  		provide this assistance.</p>
<p>The problem of caregiver physical strain has received little attention  		in family caregiver support efforts, with most programs focused on emotional  		support or respite. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ASPE  		contracted with the Lewin Group and our consultants, Drs. William Mann and Majd  		Alwan, for this study to lay the groundwork for accelerating the use of  		assistive technology (AT) and home modifications (HM) to reduce caregiver  		physical strain. The study has two components. For the <i>research</i>  		component, the study team conducted a systematic literature review to assess  		and synthesize the evidence base that AT/HM reduces family caregiver physical  		strain. Drawing on findings from the review, in the  		<i>adoption/dissemination</i> component, we developed user-friendly resources  		and recommendations to encourage and facilitate the National Family Caregiver  		Support Program (NFCSP) to include appropriate services to reduce caregivers'  		physical strain, as part of the range of services they offer. This project is  		funded through one of several provisions in the American Recovery and  		Reinvestment Act of 2009 to advance the use of technology to support older  		people and their caregivers.</p>
<p>The project focused primarily on the NFCSP as a dissemination venue  		because this large federal program is where many family caregivers go for  		support. Established in 2000 as part of the reauthorization of the Older  		Americans Act (Title III E) and administered by the Administration on Aging  		(AoA), the NFCSP funds services to support family caregivers caring for people  		age 60 and older and people of any age with Alzheimer's disease or related  		dementia. The program also supports grandparent/ relative caregivers of  		children and of adults under age 60 with disabilities. Allowable services  		include information, assistance with accessing services, counseling, support  		groups, training, respite, and supplemental services, which include AT/HM,  		transportation, medical supplies, and other services. </p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>For additional details on study methods, see the literature review  		report (<b><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/AccAdoAT.shtml#partI">Part  		I</a></b> and <b><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/AccAdoAT.shtml#appendA">Appendix  		A</a></b>) and the adoption/dissemination report (<b><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2012/AccAdoAT.shtml#partII">Part  		II</a></b>).</p>
<p><i><b>Systematic Review of the Research Literature</b></i></p>
<p>The first component of the study was a review of the literature to  		assess and synthesize the evidence base on the effects of AT/HM on reducing  		family caregiver physical strain. Much of the research and activity on  		promoting technologies to reduce caregiver injuries/physical strain has focused  		on paid caregivers (e.g., nurses, nurse aides, orderlies), particularly those  		working in nursing facilities and hospitals. Thus, we examined the literature  		on outcomes among paid caregivers in institutional and home and community-based  		settings to identify implications for family caregivers. We also examined the  		literature on the impact of AT/HM on increasing independence of older adults  		living at home, because any device that increases independence for the care  		recipient is likely to simultaneously relieve the burden for care providers  		(Mann, 2001). Finally, we reviewed the small but growing body of literature on  		AT/HM interventions that focus on family caregivers directly.</p>
<p>To identify relevant published and unpublished studies, we combined a  		search of the academic literature in PubMed/MEDLINE with a targeted Internet  		search of websites with information about technology and long-term care.  		Additional studies surfaced through other sources, including examination of  		reference lists of included studies, conference proceedings, and discussions  		with members of the study technical advisory group and caregiver advisory  		group.</p>
<p><i><b>Development of Strategies for Increasing Dissemination of  		AT/HM</b></i></p>
<p>To develop recommendations for increasing the dissemination of AT/HM to  		reduce caregiver physical strain to a wider audience of family caregivers and  		service providers, we conducted webinars/teleconferences, site visits, and  		telephone interviews with experts and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Information about innovative strategies and recommendations for  		addressing caregiver physical strain were obtained through a combination of  		webinars/teleconferences, site visits, and telephone interviews with technical  		experts, family caregivers, and NFCSP staff. In addition, program officers from  		ASPE and AoA, along with two consultants with expertise in the design and use  		of AT/HM, provided input throughout the project (e.g., participating in webinar  		discussions, commenting on report drafts).</p>
<p>First, we recruited a technical expert panel (TEP) of AT/HM experts and  		a Caregiver Advisory Panel (CAP) of individuals with both personal caregiving  		experience and knowledge of broad family caregiving issues. The study team met  		with the TEP by teleconference/webinar in January 2010. This was followed by a  		teleconference/webinar with the CAP in February 2011. These discussions  		provided the opportunity to garner input on the draft literature review. We  		also met with some key experts individually by phone. In December, 2011, we  		convened a joint meeting of the TEP and CAP, which provided opportunity to  		elicit input from both groups on drafts of the two guides developed through  		this project and recommendations for future initiatives.</p>
<p>To learn about strategies for accelerating the use of AT/HM to mitigate  		caregiver strain through the NFCSP network, we conducted site visits to 11  		NFCSP programs in person (Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah) or by  		phone (Alabama, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin). The  		sites represented diverse experiences with AT/HM. They included: programs using  		advanced/innovative approaches to providing AT/HM to family caregivers; sites  		that were interested in the area, but not sure how to initiate a program; and  		sites with no efforts specifically focused on promoting AT/HM. The selected  		programs also represented diverse geographic regions. We interviewed NFCSP  		administrators, managers, case managers (CMs), and participants at program  		offices and in the homes of older adults and family caregivers to gain deeper  		understanding of caregiver needs related to physical strain as well as  		effective solutions. The visits took place between June and November 2011.  		Information gained from the site visits was used to develop the NFCSP strategy  		guide. Site visit participants were asked to review a draft of this guide and  		provide feedback through an online tool.</p>
<p>After meeting with the joint TEP/CAP panel and incorporating their input  		on draft documents, the next step was to convene a panel of 11 NFCSP program  		representatives. The panel was convened in October 2011. Participants provided  		input on suggested strategies and resources for NFCSPs that emerged from the  		site visits, as well as recommendations for additional policy and research  		activity to accelerate the use of AT/HM to reduce caregiver physical strain.  		The NFCSP panel was asked to review the guides developed through this project  		and to provide feedback through an online tool.</p>
<p>Finally, the FCA conducted an online survey of family caregivers on the  		use of AT, which was fielded over six months. A snowball sampling methodology  		was used to recruit a convenience sample of family caregivers to complete the  		survey through the FCA, Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs), and some  		Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). A total of 423 surveys were initiated. The  		survey inquired about experiences and needs related to AT/HM, training on the  		use of AT/HM, and caregiver physical strain. The Lewin Group was able to  		analyze those survey results for this final report.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Key Findings from the Literature Review</h2>
<p><i><b>Findings from Facility-Based Studies</b></i></p>
<p>Most of the research on AT/HM to mitigate caregiver strain has been  		conducted with caregiving staff in nursing facilities and hospitals, while  		physical strain among family caregivers has received less attention. Although  		family caregivers perform many of the same services as caregiving staff in  		nursing facilities and other settings, caregivers at home are less likely to  		have access to assistive devices such as mechanical lifts that can help protect  		them from physical strain associated with caregiving. The studies based in  		nursing facilities and hospitals examined the effects of mechanical aids for  		lifting and transferring on caregiver strain. The devices were often provided  		in combination with other interventions such as training in device use,  		collaborating with caregiving staff to assess the need for AT, and "zero lift"  		(avoidance of manual lifting) policies. Significant positive impacts were found  		on reducing caregiver injuries, resulting in fewer lost workdays and long-term  		cost savings, and increased feelings of comfort and safety for people receiving  		care. These studies also reported the danger of increased caregiver injury  		resulting from lifting a minimal or non-weight-bearing person without a  		mechanical device. Important factors affecting program success included  		ensuring sufficient time and training to use the equipment and overcoming  		caregiver resistance to using new devices.</p>
<p><i><b>Findings from Studies with Home Care Workers</b></i></p>
<p>A small number of studies examined the use of assistive devices among  		home care workers who assist older adults living at home. In contrast to  		facilities, large devices such as mechanical lifts are less available in home  		settings where home care workers and family caregivers provide care. However,  		one pilot program in Canada (Craib et al., 2007) used a registry of loaner  		lifts as an affordable way to provide home care workers with access to ceiling  		lifts. </p>
<p>Of the few studies with home workers, most focused on the use of  		back-belts, and the research on the effectiveness of these devices has been  		mixed. In the TEP panel discussions, an expert indicated that gait belts and  		slings could be used, but only if the care recipient was partially  		weight-bearing. Waters (2007) discusses the National Institute for Occupational  		Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation guidelines and how they relate to  		safe patient-handling. The guidelines state that caregivers should not lift  		more than 35 pounds of a patient's weight; therefore, if a patient is  		non-weight-bearing, they should use AT. In a NIOSH (2009) publication on Safe  		Patient Handling Training for Schools of Nursing, an algorithm is presented for  		lifting patients. They suggest that if the patient can partially bear their  		weight and is cooperative, then the caregiver can use a gait/transfer belt or a  		power-stand assist lift for the transfer.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><i><b>Findings from Studies with Older Adults Living at Home  		</b></i></p>
<p>Several experimental studies tested the benefits of providing older  		adults living at home with occupational therapy (OT) interventions, including  		AT/HM. A key element of these interventions is a person-centered approach, in  		which OTs assess the home and work with the older person to identify solutions  		to increase their capacity to age in place. All of these studies found positive  		results, including user satisfaction with the devices, reduced functional  		decline and improved functioning, reduced depression, reduced need for paid  		assistance, and lower expenditures for nurse and case management visits.  		Although this decreased need for assistance would likely reduce physical strain  		for caregivers (because they would be providing less care), it was not directly  		measured in any of the studies. Many of the devices used were low-cost, such as  		hand-held showers, reachers, grab bars, nightlights, and tub mats. These  		studies highlight the importance of assisting older adults with proper  		assessment of the need for AT/HM and raising awareness and acceptance of new  		technologies, because many older adults and family caregivers were unaware of  		available AT/HM solutions that might assist them. Older adult receptivity to  		using AT/HM was related to both the characteristics of the device, such as  		intrusiveness, and the characteristics of the older adult, such as social  		support. Also important was the capacity of service agencies to provide AT/HM  		to older adults, including CM and social worker (SW) training on the benefits  		and uses of AT/HM, and the time allocated for tasks related to these  		services.</p>
<p><i><b>Findings from Studies with Family Caregivers and Dyads</b></i></p>
<p>Studies testing the provision of OT services including AT/HM to family  		caregivers or family caregiver/older adult dyads reported positive results of  		this approach. Benefits included less need for assistance, reduced caregiver  		burden, less time spent caregiving, decrease in caregiver depression, enhanced  		caregiver skills, enhanced caregiver ability to self-care, fewer problem  		behaviors of people with dementia, and reductions in health care costs.  		However, none of the studies directly measured impacts on family caregiver  		physical strain. Similar to the studies with older adults, these studies  		demonstrated the effectiveness of small, low-cost devices. The most common HMs  		needed included enhancements to bathroom safety (grab bars, walk-in shower,  		hand-held showerhead, shower seat); modifications to address the older adult's  		memory loss (additional lights, signs, and labels); and devices for activity  		engagement. Family caregivers' ability to implement HM was related to  		attributes of the modification (e.g., the cost, ease and comfort of use),  		attributes of the caregiver (skills, personal resources, available supports,  		younger age, early adopters of technology), and the quality of the  		caregiver-older adult relationship. Additionally, this research highlights the  		importance of effective caregiver training on technology use, person-centered  		approaches that involve both caregivers and care recipients in identifying  		solutions, and CM/SW knowledge of AT/HM for family caregivers. </p>
<p><i><b>Conclusion and Research Gaps</b></i></p>
<p>The evidence suggested that a wide range of AT/HM could help prevent  		strains and other injuries among caregiving staff in facilities,enhance  		functioning and independence of older adults, reduce the need for assistance,  		and reduce various aspects of caregiver burden. Many of the programs found to  		be successful used a person-centered approach that included assessing the care  		recipient's environment and needs, identifying solutions, training in the use  		of AT/HM, addressing injuries, and assessing results, in many cases including  		OT.</p>
<p>However, additional research is needed to directly measure outcomes on  		physical strain among caregivers in the home. Also, additional research is  		needed to assess long-term impacts of various types of devices on different  		aspects of physical strain among family and paid caregivers in the home setting  		and their cost impacts. Also needed is additional research on how to overcome  		barriers to more widespread adoption of equipment and safe handling practices  		that have been found to be effective in reducing physical strain. Finally, more  		research is needed to develop technologies designed for use by older adults and  		their caregivers in the home.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Key Findings from Experts and Stakeholders</h2>
<p><i><b>Findings from the FCA Online Caregiver Survey</b></i></p>
<p>The online caregiver survey showed that many caregivers are purchasing  		AT/HM and find it useful. However, findings also suggested a need to raise  		awareness of available AT/HM, to address caregivers' concerns about costs, and  		to offer caregiver training on AT/HM and techniques to minimize physical  		strain. The Internet, physicians' offices, and AAAs were the top places where  		caregivers go for information on AT/HM.</p>
<p><i><b>Strategies and Resources for Family Caregivers and  		NFCSPs</b></i></p>
<p>The site visits and discussions revealed many tips and resources that  		can help family caregivers reduce their risk of physical strain, assess their  		homes, and select, access, and pay for AT/HM. We also identified a number of  		innovative strategies and resources that the NFCSP network can use to assist  		family caregivers with AT/HM.</p>
<p>As a first step in disseminating this information, the study team  		developed a guide for family caregivers and a guide for NFCSPs. Each guide will  		be made available in both a print handout version and an online version and  		disseminated through ADRCs and various other channels. In addition, research  		findings from this study have been or will be presented at three national  		conference.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> Also, findings were presented in a  		guest blog on <a href="http://www.disability.gov">http://www.disability.gov</a>, which is  		operated by the Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) and has nearly  		30,000 followers. Results will also be shared at a retreat of the National  		Association of Community Health Centers in January 2012 and the Greater  		Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources Conference in September 2012.</p>
<p><i><b>AT Expert Panel and Caregiver Advisory Group Suggestions for  		Adoption/Dissemination Strategies</b></i></p>
<p>In discussions with experts and stakeholders, consensus emerged that  		accelerating the use of AT/HM to reduce physical strain among family caregivers  		will require a comprehensive dissemination strategy. Building on the  		dissemination of the resource guides developed through this project, additional  		recommended strategies for dissemination included:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Developing multiple informational resources (e.g., videos,  			 brochures, training courses on AT/HM and preventing physical strain).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disseminating the information through multiple channels (e.g.,  			 online, physicians' offices, community organizations, the media).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reaching multiple target audiences (e.g., family caregivers, CMs and  			 SWs who work with caregivers, physicians, builders, and contractors).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A suggested next step was to convene a national meeting of a wider group  		of stakeholders involved in AT/HM for older adults and their caregivers, to  		develop and carry out a dissemination plan. Panel participants noted that this  		could provide opportunity for the AoA Aging Network to establish new  		partnerships.</p>
<p><i><b>AT Experts and Family Caregiver Advisory Group Suggestions for  		Policy</b></i></p>
<p>In addition, panel participants agreed that overcoming barriers to  		family caregiver use of AT/HM will also require changes to several aspects of  		health, long-term care, and housing policy, including: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Challenges to accessing AT/HM should be addressed within programs  			 that offer and/or pay for some AT/HM services (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, U.S.  			 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing assistance programs).  			 Experts and stakeholders recommended expanding coverage to include a  			 comprehensive array of AT/HM, to respond to individual needs for support to  			 retain independence and live at home. In addition, these programs need to be  			 better aligned in support of the common goal of supporting family caregiving  			 and community living for older adults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another frequently mentioned recommendation was to expand coverage  			 in public programs for OT and physical therapy (PT) services. OTs can provide  			 in-depth assessment of a person's home and suggest specific solutions that  			 could help the person maximize function and retain independence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another issue raised by several panel participants is the need to  			 modify housing and zoning laws to support aging in place and multi-generational  			 living and to enact policies encouraging universal design in new  			 construction.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Suggestions for Future Research</b></i></p>
<p>The discussions indicated two broad areas where additional research is  		needed:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>To develop and expand AT/HM efforts, additional research will be  			 needed to identify effective approaches and evaluate their impacts on reducing  			 caregiver strain, increasing independence of the care recipient, and saving  			 costs. These research questions could be addressed through a potential  			 demonstration project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also needed is additional research to develop and test new AT/HM  			 products designed specifically for family caregivers and older adults living at  			 home. Panel participants discussed that one of the barriers to using AT/HM is  			 that many products are designed for use in institutions, rather than in the  			 home.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The above recommendations suggested by experts and stakeholders are  		supported by the research literature. Implementing these actions to encourage  		the use of AT/HM to reduce caregiver physical strain would also support recent  		federal efforts to promote community living, evidence-based health care, and  		cost savings.</p>
