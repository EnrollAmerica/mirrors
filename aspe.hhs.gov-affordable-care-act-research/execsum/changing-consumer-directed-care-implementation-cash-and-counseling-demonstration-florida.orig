<p>Consumer direction seeks to give frail elders and people with  		disabilities more options and greater personal autonomy in determining how best  		to meet their care needs. Cash and Counseling is one model of consumer-directed  		home- and community-based services. Under the Cash and Counseling model,  		eligible people receive a monthly allowance. In turn, they assume  		responsibility for arranging and managing their care and must use the benefit  		to purchase goods or services to meet their needs for home- and community-based  		services--this includes hiring their own workers. Consumers may ask consultants  		for training on how to meet those responsibilities and may have a fiscal agent  		hold their allowance, manage payroll taxes, and disburse funds on their behalf.  		</p>
<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services are sponsoring a demonstration and evaluation of Cash  		and Counseling. A National Program Office operates from the University of  		Maryland, Center on Aging and Boston College. The Centers for Medicare &amp;  		Medicaid Services (CMS) provides technical assistance and waivers of certain  		federal Medicaid regulations. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) is  		evaluating the demonstration, which has been implemented in Arkansas, Florida,  		and New Jersey. The evaluation used a randomized design--half of the enrollees  		are assigned to a treatment group to receive the allowance, half to a control  		group to continue with traditional services. </p>
<p>This report describes the design and implementation of the  		Consumer-Directed Care Research Project (CDC), Floridas model of Cash and  		Counseling, and draws lessons from the states experience. The report is  		based primarily on in-person interviews conducted in January 2002, about 18  		months after the project began enrolling beneficiaries. Interviews were  		conducted with Florida state officials, state employees at the regional level,  		CDC staff members, and staff members of organizations providing consulting and  		fiscal services under CDC. (Florida used the term consulting rather  		than counseling in its demonstration.)</p>
<p></p>
<h3 align="CENTER">The Consumer-Directed Care Project</h3>
<p><b>Feeder Programs and Host Departments</b>. Under Section 1115  		demonstration authority, Florida chose to cash out home- and  		community-based services covered under its Medicaid 1915(c) waiver programs for  		children and adults with developmental disabilities, adults with physical  		disabilities, and elderly beneficiaries. The Developmental Disability Program  		(DDP) within the Department of Children and Families (DCF) was responsible for  		1915(c) programs and for the CDC project for children and adults with  		developmental disabilities. The Office of Adult Services (AS), within DCF, had  		similar responsibilities for adults with physical disabilities, and the  		Department of Elder Affairs (DOEA) had similar responsibilities for elderly  		beneficiaries. DOEA was the official grantee and housed the central office for  		the CDC program. Each of these 1915(c) waiver programs covers a variety of  		goods and services. These goods and services range from personal care supplies,  		to personal assistance, to professional services (such as nursing and  		behavioral therapy). </p>
<p><b>Structure of Traditional Waiver Services</b>. In Floridas  		waiver programs for children and adults with developmental disabilities,  		support coordinators help program participants manage their care (support  		coordination services were not cashed out). The support coordinators are  		employed by agencies (typically proprietary firms) or are independent  		contractors. Many support coordinators serve populous areas of the state, and  		consumers may choose a support coordinator with whom they are comfortable. </p>
<p>Similarly, in Floridas waiver programs for adults with physical  		disabilities and elderly beneficiaries, case managers help program participants  		manage their care (case management services also were not cashed out). In each  		county in Florida, a single agency--called a lead agency--provides case  		management services to all elderly participants in that county. The lead  		agencies typically are public agencies, and all lead agencies provide case  		management under contract to the local Area Agency on Aging (AAA). Each of the  		11 AAAs in Florida is under contract to the state to procure and oversee  		Medicaid waiver services for elderly people living in its catchment area. Case  		management for adults with physical disabilities may be provided by state  		employees or case management agencies under contract to the state. </p>
<p><b>Eligibility for CDC</b>. The only people eligible to enroll in CDC  		were beneficiaries receiving services under one of the Medicaid waiver programs  		being cashed out and living in the catchment area for the CDC project. For  		children with developmental disabilities, the catchment area consisted of the  		entire state. For adults with developmental disabilities, the catchment area  		consisted of the entire state, except for a few counties in the northern part  		of the state where another consumer-directed pilot program was already under  		way. For adults with physical disabilities and elderly beneficiaries, the  		catchment area consisted of 19 counties and included most of the states  		major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Waiver program participants who wished to enroll in CDC, but who were  		unable to manage their own services, were still eligible for CDC. Adults could  		name a family member or friend as a representative to act on their behalf.  		Representatives, invariably a parent or guardian, were mandated for children.  		</p>
<p><b>Outreach and Enrollment</b>. Initially, Florida required agencies  		providing case management/support coordination services to conduct outreach for  		CDC. Case managers and support coordinators were required to inform waiver  		program participants of their eligibility for CDC, just as they were required  		to inform them of all programs for which they were eligible. </p>
<p>This approach to outreach and enrollment proved largely unsuccessful,  		however. Many case managers were skeptical about the value of consumer-directed  		care, and support coordinators were overwhelmed with work following a  		substantial expansion of funding for traditional waiver services for those with  		developmental disabilities. </p>
<p>Faced with lagging enrollment in CDC, Florida arranged for the state  		governor to send a CDC invitation letter to each waiver program participant.  		(Arkansas had also done this.) In addition, Florida hired temporary state staff  		as enrollment specialists to contact waiver program participants to describe  		CDC and to enroll those who were interested. After the state took these steps,  		enrollment surged. When enrollment for the evaluation sample ended (in July  		2002), 1,004 children, 1,002 nonelderly adults, and 814 elderly beneficiaries  		had enrolled in CDC. </p>
<p><b>Determining the Amount of the Monthly Budget</b>. Florida based the  		amount of the allowance (which it called the monthly budget) on the waiver  		recipients claims history or on his or her care plan or support plan (the  		latter term is used for those with developmental disabilities). The claims  		history methodology was not used for beneficiaries with developmental  		disabilities. For other beneficiaries, the care plan methodology was used if  		the beneficiary did not have a stable, recent claims history or the benefit  		amount based on the care plan was materially larger than that based on the  		claims history. </p>
<p>To try to ensure the budget neutrality of the CDC project, the amount of  		a monthly budget based on care/support plan hours was discounted to adjust for  		the fact that, on average, the cost of services received is less than the cost  		of services planned. Based on analyses of care plan and claims data for samples  		of beneficiaries, Florida set the discount rates at 89 percent for elderly  		beneficiaries, 83 percent for adults with physical disabilities, and 92 percent  		for children and adults with developmental disabilities. </p>
<p>About the time of our visit to Florida in January 2002, the average  		monthly budget (after discounting) in Florida was $975 for elderly adults and  		adults with physical disabilities and $1,825 for children and adults with  		developmental disabilities. </p>
<p><b>Purchasing Plan and Use of the Monthly Budget</b>. Before consumers  		could receive the first payment, CDC required them to develop a plan for the  		purchase of goods and services. Plans could provide for the consumer to receive  		up to 20 percent of the monthly budget in cash (or more with special  		permission). (Later, the cash payment was limited to $250 a month.) </p>
<p>CDC consultants visited the consumers home to train the consumer  		on the permissible uses of the monthly budget and the development of the  		initial purchasing plan. Consumers were required to develop a revised  		purchasing plan if the amount of the monthly budget or the amount of any line  		item in the plan changed.</p>
<p>Consultants reviewed and approved all initial or revised purchasing  		plans, then submitted them to a state or district office for approval. Plans  		for consumers with developmental disabilities were reviewed and approved by the  		Medicaid specialist in the DDP district office for that region. The CDC project  		central office reviewed and approved the plans for adults with physical  		disabilities and elderly consumers. </p>
<p>Consumers used the monthly budget to purchase a wide variety of goods  		and services, just as CDC had intended. Many hired workers, most of whom were  		family members. Some hired a parent (for the demonstration, a waiver of  		Medicaid regulations permitted the hiring of a parent of a minor child or a  		spouse). A few representatives were hired as workers. Some consumers also  		purchased personal care supplies (such as diapers). </p>
<p><b>Monitoring</b>. Florida required CDC consultants to visit  		consumers homes during the 2nd and 12th month after enrollment (and  		annually thereafter) to monitor the consumers condition. Consultants were  		also required to telephone consumers at least monthly. </p>
<p><b>Consulting Agencies</b>. Florida asked agencies and independent  		contractors providing waiver program case management/support coordination to  		also provide consulting for beneficiaries who enrolled in CDC. The availability  		of funding was a major factor in this decision--state funds were already  		committed for the payment of these agencies and contractors. In addition,  		Florida believed that reliance on the existing networks would be beneficial to  		consumers for two reasons: (1) case managers and support coordinators were  		already knowledgeable about other programs and community resources, and (2)  		continuity of care could be enhanced by having a consumers case manager  		or support coordinator continue to work with that person as a CDC consultant.  		</p>
<p>In practice, however, only a few staff members at each agency provided  		CDC consulting (often only one or two even in large agencies). This approach  		was more efficient than having many staff members, each of whom provided  		consulting to only a few consumers. In addition, the shift in responsibilities  		under CDC from case manager/support coordinator to consumer was sometimes more  		difficult when the person who had been a case manager (or support coordinator)  		became the consultant. </p>
<p>CDC adopted different payment structures for consulting by support  		coordinators and consulting by case managers. A monthly rate per beneficiary  		was paid for support coordination/consulting; this rate was the same as that  		paid for traditional support coordination. In contrast, a flat sum was paid for  		each case management/consultant training visit to develop the purchasing plan  		(up to two visits), followed by an hourly rate for consulting services  		(payments at the hourly rate were capped). </p>
<p><b>Fiscal Services</b>. Florida issued a solicitation to procure a  		single fiscal agent for CDC consumers across the state. After a lengthy delay,  		it contracted with a human services organization in another state on the  		eastern seaboard. This delay occurred after the initial consultant training  		sessions had already taken place, necessitating refresher training for  		consultants.</p>
<p>Florida required that CDC consumers purchase services from the fiscal  		agent. Those who wished to manage the monthly budget themselves had to  		demonstrate that they were capable of doing so and had to purchase a monthly  		review of their records and receipts from the fiscal agent. All other consumers  		were required to use the fiscal agent to cut checks and process payroll  		documents. For these consumers, the fiscal agents duties were to process  		employment forms, federal and state payroll taxes, and time sheets and vendor  		payments; disburse cash to consumers; and prepare monthly financial statements  		to consumers (with a copy to consultants).</p>
<p>Floridas approach to ensuring that expenditures conformed to the  		purchasing plan was to have consultants compare monthly financial statements to  		plans and retrain consumers if there were discrepancies. In addition, consumers  		had to retain receipts for the consultant to review for purchases made with  		cash from the monthly budget. </p>
<p>Most of the compensation for the fiscal agent was in the form of fees  		charged to consumers for the services they used. A consumer was charged about  		$5 per check cut, up to a maximum of $25 a month. Consumers who managed the  		monthly budget themselves were charged about $10 a month for fiscal agent  		review. Florida also paid the fiscal agent for some design tasks (such as  		design of the bookkeeping skills examination for consumers).</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">Lessons from the Consumer-Directed Care Project</h3>
<p>Floridas experience provides many lessons about operating a  		consumer-directed program as an alternative to Medicaid home- and community  		based waivers. The state was willing to learn from its experience and try a  		different approach if problems arose. Here, we describe lessons pertaining to  		specific components of CDC, followed by lessons that cut across components and  		that are unique to Florida among the three Cash and Counseling states. </p>
<p><b>Outreach and Enrollment</b></p>
<ul><li><b><i>A consumer-directed program that cashes out traditional  		  services needs the cooperation of the agencies providing those services;  		  however, assigning these agencies responsibility for outreach and enrollment  		  can be fraught with problems.</i></b> Case management agencies often have their  		  clients trust and can easily discourage enrollment if they are opposed to  		  the concept of consumer direction. Even when that is not the case, agency staff  		  members who are pressed by other responsibilities are unlikely to give priority  		  to the time-consuming tasks of outreach and enrollment. </li>
<li><b><i>If state agencies are responsible for outreach and enrollment,  		  arranging for enrollment statistics to be reported to the highest levels of  		  state government may be a useful way to get the attention of the responsible  		  officials.</i></b> When enrollment in CDC was lagging, DDP arranged for  		  statistics on the outreach effort to be included in monthly reports reviewed by  		  the governors office in assessing administrator performance. After that,  		  enrollment improved.</li>
<li><b><i>Providing information to advocacy groups can be a successful  		  approach to generating interest in an allowance program.</i></b> Florida has a  		  tradition of strong advocacy for those with developmental disabilities,  		  particularly through its Family Care Councils. Presentations to the councils  		  generated considerable interest in Floridas allowance program.</li>
<li><b><i>Because direct mailings to eligible beneficiaries are targeted,  		  they are more efficient than outreach methods that blanket the community with  		  information.</i></b> Letters from the governor to recipients of Medicaid waiver  		  services were particularly effective in generating enrollment in Floridas  		  allowance program.</li>
<li><b><i>Calculating the amount of the allowance before enrollment is  		  important but can be time-consuming.</i></b> Beneficiaries need to know the  		  amount of the allowance to make an informed decision about enrollment. If the  		  allowance is based on the claims history or the care/support plan, the amount  		  must be calculated under each methodology.</li>
<li><b><i>Hiring dedicated enrollment specialists may be the best  		  approach to building a caseload relatively quickly. </i></b>Unless agency staff  		  are enthusiastic about consumer direction, hiring dedicated employees is  		  preferable to paying agencies to have their staff conduct outreach and  		  enrollment. </li>
<li><b><i>A limited number of dedicated enrollment staff may successfully  		  serve a wide geographic area.</i></b> Dedicated enrollment staff can come into  		  an area, contact all members of the eligible population there, and then move  		  on. Floridas experience is that such enrollment specialists can be  		  supervised from district offices or remotely by telephone, e-mail, and an  		  Internet chat room. </li>
<li><b><i>The explanation of the cash program provided to prospective  		  enrollees should be as clear as possible.</i></b> Although an allowance program  		  can be difficult for consumers to understand, lack of clear explanation  		  engenders confusion, which consultants must correct. Moreover, consumers might  		  disenroll when the misunderstanding is corrected. </li>
</ul><p><b>Consulting </b></p>
<ul><li><b><i>The same person can readily provide both consulting and case  		  management (or support coordination) services.</i></b> Case managers and  		  support coordinators who were comfortable with the philosophy of consumer  		  direction did not have difficulty providing case management or support  		  coordination to waiver program participants and consulting to CDC consumers.  		  </li>
<li><b><i>Consultants require substantial training, followed shortly by  		  practice.</i></b> Florida limited its training session for consultants to one  		  and a half days, and consultants generally felt that more time was needed.  		  Knowledge gained in the initial training session was forgotten because  		  consultants were not able to put it into practice quickly.</li>
<li><b><i>Conference calls can provide updates and peer support to  		  consultants working in far-flung agencies.</i></b> Conference calls give  		  consultants a means to learn tricks of the trade. Apart from cost,  		  the only disadvantage of conference calls is that they may provide a forum for  		  consultants to voice negative opinions that may adversely affect staff  		  morale.</li>
<li><b><i>Regional program supervisors can provide valuable support to  		  frontline consulting staff.</i></b> DDP Medicaid specialists reduced the burden  		  on central CDC staff by supervising enrollment specialists and by reviewing and  		  approving consumer purchasing plans. Some became so knowledgeable about CDC  		  that they were able to offer technical assistance and support to consultants  		  and consumers.</li>
</ul><p><b>Purchasing Plans and Use of the Allowance</b></p>
<ul><li><b><i>Advance preparation can expedite the development of the  		  purchasing plan.</i></b> Some Florida consultants expedited the development of  		  the purchasing plan. They did this, for example, by asking consumers to review  		  the program manual and to begin, before the home visit, to think about their  		  needs and what to purchase to meet those needs. </li>
<li><b><i>A consumer manual is an important tool.</i></b> It helps the  		  consumer become familiar with program procedures and rules before the initial  		  consultant training visit. It is also useful as a reference manual. </li>
<li><b><i>Although working with a consumer on the initial purchasing plan  		  can be time-consuming for consultants, a consumers need for help in  		  completing the plan does not necessarily indicate inappropriateness for an  		  allowance program.</i></b> Florida learned that consumers and representatives  		  were usually able to identify the goods and services to be included in an  		  initial purchasing plan but that many needed help (for example, with  		  arithmetic) to complete the plan. Of itself, the need for such help did not  		  indicate that a consumer was inappropriate for CDC.</li>
<li><b><i>Purchasing plans must be revised as consumer needs and plans  		  change, and this requires a substantial amount of staff time. However, flexible  		  plans can reduce the need for revision.</i></b> Because the purchasing plan is  		  critical to ensuring that the allowance is not abused, it must be revised to  		  accommodate changes in consumer needs. Doing so requires a substantial amount  		  of time from consultants and from other program staff who must approve revised  		  plans. The need for revision can be reduced by listing the wage and hours for a  		  position, earmarking a larger proportion for cash, and using an addendum to  		  specify a change in the good or service for which funds are being saved.</li>
<li><b><i>Consumers may be able to purchase goods for less than the  		  Medicaid program does.</i></b> By shopping for sale prices, Florida consumers  		  were able to purchase goods such as personal care supplies from commercial  		  establishments for less than the Florida Medicaid program paid vendors. </li>
</ul><p><b>Representatives</b></p>
<ul><li><b><i>Consumers usually choose family or friends who were already  		  helping them as representatives to assist in managing the benefit.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>All, or almost all, consumers with development disabilities  		  will require a representative, and many elderly consumers will select a  		  one.</i></b> All minor children will require a representative.</li>
<li><b><i>Naming representatives at enrollment may be  		  advantageous.</i></b> The consultant can begin to work with the representative  		  on the purchasing plan before the initial home training visit, thereby reducing  		  delay of the receipt of the allowance. </li>
<li><b><i>Representatives are generally faithful to the best interests of  		  consumers and try to take their wishes into account. </i></b>While this was  		  true for all consumers, Florida consultants reported that parents sometimes  		  went to extraordinary lengths for their children.</li>
<li><b><i>Special forms of monitoring are needed when a representative is  		  also a worker, as this situation presents an inherent conflict of  		  interest.</i></b> Because representatives are responsible for supervising  		  workers, allowing the same person to play both roles presents a conflict of  		  interest. When such a situation could not readily be avoided, Florida asked  		  someone identified by the consumers family to check on the  		  consumers well-being, and the counselor telephoned that person as well as  		  the representative. A similar approach might be beneficial when the  		  representative is the coach of an adult with developmental disabilities living  		  in a group home. Such a coach has a responsibility to the group home as well as  		  to the consumer. </li>
</ul><p><b>Fiscal Services</b></p>
<ul><li><b><i>A fiscal agent may need assistance with cash flow until it  		  reaches a break-even caseload.</i></b> The CDC project was a  		  financial drain on the host organization for fiscal services, in part because  		  of the slow buildup of the caseload. </li>
<li><b><i>The quality of consumer services may suffer if the fiscal agent  		  is under prolonged financial strain because its costs exceed its payments.  		  </i></b>The fiscal agent for CDC reduced its staff in response to the financial  		  strain it faced, which adversely affected responsiveness to consumer requests  		  and timely production of consumer financial statements.</li>
<li><b><i>Timely, understandable, and detailed financial statements are  		  important to consumers ability to manage the allowance, but a fiscal  		  agent may have difficulty producing such statements.</i></b> As in other Cash  		  and Counseling states, the fiscal agent for CDC had difficulty producing  		  monthly financial statements that were timely, easily understandable, and  		  detailed. Consumers value statements that detail the date, amount, and payee of  		  each debit from their accounts.</li>
<li><b><i>Fiscal agents need procedures that minimize the use of postal  		  services for time-critical deliveries.</i></b> Examples of such procedures used  		  in CDC are direct deposit of workers pay into bank accounts and  		  submission of the first time sheet for a given worker by facsimile (with the  		  original to follow by mail). </li>
</ul><p><b>Monitoring to Prevent Neglect of Consumers and Abuse of the  		Allowance</b></p>
<p>Exploitation and neglect of consumers and abuse of the allowance were  		rare in the CDC project. </p>
<ul><li><b><i>Referral arrangements with organizations providing protective  		  services may be beneficial.</i></b> Florida developed formal arrangements for  		  consultants to refer cases of potential neglect or exploitation to protective  		  services so that expert assistance was available to consultants  		  immediately.</li>
<li><b><i>Telephone monitoring that involves only the representative is  		  inadequate. The appropriate frequency for monitoring visits varies with the  		  population served.</i></b> If consumers can articulate their needs and  		  concerns, a call to the consumer (as well as to the representative) is  		  necessary to identify the rare cases of potential neglect or exploitation of  		  the consumer. More frequent monitoring visits are likely required for consumers  		  (such as those with developmental disabilities) who have difficulty  		  articulating their needs and concerns. </li>
<li><b><i>Relying on consultants to compare monthly financial statements  		  to purchasing plans increases the need for communication between the consultant  		  and the fiscal agent, which can be problematic.</i></b> Having consultants  		  compare expenditures to purchasing plans may be problematic, especially when  		  consultants and fiscal staff are organizationally separate. </li>
<li><b><i>Review of receipts is not critical to preventing abuse of funds  		  held by the fiscal agent. </i></b>CDC required review of receipts only for cash  		  held by the consumer, and some consultants reported that they did not routinely  		  review these receipts. Yet abuse of funds held by the fiscal agent was almost  		  nonexistent. </li>
</ul><p><b>Cross-Cutting Lessons Unique to Florida</b></p>
<p>Florida was the only one of the three Cash and Counseling programs to  		rely primarily on agencies providing traditional services to provide outreach,  		enrollment, and consulting under its cash program. It was the only one of the  		three to cash out services for children, services for beneficiaries with  		developmental disabilities, and services provided under a waiver rather than  		the state Medicaid plan. Arguably, Floridas program invested more  		responsibility in the consumer (or representative) than did the other two  		programs. Here, we draw cross-cutting lessons related to these unique features  		of Floridas allowance program.</p>
<ul><li><b><i>Many factors seem to affect the level of resistance of  		  providers of traditional services to an allowance program. States interested in  		  relying on agencies providing traditional services to implement an allowance  		  program may be able to reduce their resistance. </i></b> The factors that  		  affect the level of resistance include agency monopoly position, competing  		  demands on staff time, concerns about loss of agency revenue if consumers hire  		  workers directly, adequacy of compensation for agency effort in outreach and  		  consulting, concerns about agency liability for decisions that consumers make,  		  and conflicting professional norms about responsibility for beneficiary  		  welfare. Techniques to overcome these factors include avoiding reliance on  		  agencies that have local monopolies on traditional services in favor of  		  agencies that must compete, avoiding implementation of an allowance program  		  when other demands on agency staff are high or when agencies are experiencing a  		  reduction in revenue, ensuring agencies are fairly compensated, stressing that  		  consumers (not agencies) are liable under a Cash and Counseling-like program,  		  and demonstrating that some beneficiaries benefit dramatically from a cash  		  program. </li>
<li><b><i>States may be able to better able to secure the interest and  		  support of organizations providing traditional services if they consult with  		  these organizations early in the design of an allowance program.</i></b>  		  Florida regretted that the schedule for Cash and Counseling prevented early  		  consultation with agencies providing traditional services. </li>
<li><b><i>The Cash and Counseling model is very attractive to parents of  		  children with developmental disabilities.</i></b> As a percentage of those  		  eligible, more children with developmental disabilities enrolled in a Cash and  		  Counseling program than any other population. As of the end of intake for the  		  evaluation, the percentages of the eligible elderly and adult populations  		  enrolling in all three Cash and Counseling states were roughly 8 to 10 and 15  		  to 20 percent, respectively. The comparable percentage for children with  		  developmental disabilities was roughly 25 percent.</li>
<li><b><i>Paying parents to be workers is a sensitive issue, but parents  		  rarely take unfair advantage of the situation.</i></b> While the parents of  		  minor children are legally responsible for their care, caring for a child with  		  disabilities requires a tremendous amount of time and energy, which affects the  		  time a parent can devote to other family members or to paid work. With the  		  safeguards implemented in CDC (including special monitoring when the  		  representative was also a worker), Floridas experience was that only very  		  rarely did parents of minor children even appear to take unfair advantage of  		  the opportunity to be paid. </li>
<li><b><i>The evidence from Florida is that consumers and their  		  representatives are able to manage some professional services, as well as  		  personal care. Professional services (such as behavioral therapy and nursing)  		  are covered under Floridas waiver programs and were cashed out.</i></b>  		  Thus, Florida consumers were implicitly given responsibility for making  		  decisions about their need for professional services.
