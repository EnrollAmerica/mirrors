<p>In the early 1980s, when acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) made  		its first appearance, it was an unfailingly acute and fatal disease. Since  		then, AIDS-specific medical expertise and treatment advances have increased  		life expectancy for people with AIDS and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and  		shifted AIDS treatment from an acute- to a chronic-care model. Home- and  		community-based services, such as assistance with daily living activities and  		the provision of home-delivered meals, have long been an integral part of AIDS  		care. However, improved health and functioning have broadened the scope of  		these services to include, for example, assistance returning to work and caring  		for families.</p>
<p>This is the final report for the project, "The Role of Home- and  		Community-Based Services in Meeting the Health Care Needs of People with AIDS,"  		conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) for the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE). The goal of the project was to assist ASPE in developing a  		research agenda for studying home- and community-based service use among people  		with AIDS. The project had three components: (1) a review of the recent  		literature describing the delivery and financing of home- and community-based  		services for people with AIDS; (2) case studies of service provision in New  		York City and Los Angeles; and (3) an analysis of use and reimbursement  		patterns for New Jersey Medicaid beneficiaries with AIDS (conducted by the AIDS  		Research Group of the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging  		Research at Rutgers University).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Evolution of the AIDS Epidemic and Its Financing </h2>
<p>In the early days of the epidemic, the typical person with AIDS was  		recognized as a white man who had contracted HIV through sexual contact with  		another man. However, the epidemic has increasingly and disproportionately  		affected women and people who belong to racial or ethnic minorities, and the  		mode of transmission has increasingly been injection drug use. Meanwhile,  		improved medical care and pharmaceutical treatment have extended the lives and  		improved the health of many people with AIDS, leading, in 1996, to the first  		decline in deaths since the start of the epidemic.</p>
<p>Changes in AIDS treatment and in the characteristics of the AIDS  		population have had profound and interrelated effects on the use of home- and  		community-based services by people with AIDS. Increased life expectancy has  		increased the duration of needed services. Improved treatment has also improved  		health and decreased levels of functional impairment for many people, which in  		turn appears to have led to a decrease in their use of traditional home- and  		community-based services (such as home-delivered meals and personal care). At  		the same time, this treatment has led to an greater need for other types of  		support, such as assistance with treatment adherence and return to work.  		Meanwhile, the increased incidence of AIDS among people with low incomes,  		people with substance abuse problems, and women with families has led to an  		increased need for home- and community-based service providers to interact more  		often and intensively with substance abuse treatment, mental health, family  		services, and public assistance systems.</p>
<p>Medicaid, Medicare, and the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources  		Emergency Act have been the major public funding sources for HIV/AIDS care  		during the 1990s. Although 1995 Medicaid spending for AIDS care was only about  		two percent of total Medicaid spending, the increase of AIDS among people with  		low incomes has placed an increasing burden on the Medicaid (and Ryan White)  		programs, particularly to fund costly protease combination therapy. The  		programs also face the challenges of reconsidering eligibility and service  		coverage criteria to reduce disincentives to work and to increase flexibility  		in meeting chronic care needs, which typically vary over time in intensity and  		type.</p>
<p>The recent trend among Medicaid programs to rein in escalating costs by  		enrolling beneficiaries in managed care plans has had, to date, only a modest  		effect on people with AIDS, because many states exclude from managed care  		people with disabilities or chronic illnesses like AIDS. In addition, although  		Medicaid covers many of the home- and community-based services that people with  		AIDS need, many Medicaid managed care plans currently exclude these services  		from capitation arrangements. As a result, little is known about how best to  		provide the full range of AIDS services in a managed care environment.  		Increased use of Medicaid managed care also raises questions about whether and  		how to integrate services currently provided with Ryan White funds to Medicaid  		beneficiaries who enter managed care.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Lessons from the Front Lines </h2>
<p>The project developed case studies to describe current provider  		approaches to delivering home- and community-based services to a changing AIDS  		population. The case studies were based on discussions at six large,  		well-established AIDS providers in Los Angeles and New York City, supplemented  		by telephone conversations with a small number of Medicaid and Ryan White  		staff. The New York providers were Gay Men's Health Crisis, the oldest and  		largest AIDS service organization in the United States; the Visiting Nurse  		Service of New York, a large, not-for-profit home health agency with a  		10-year-old AIDS program; and Village Center for Care, a continuum of  		AIDS-specific home care, day treatment, case management, and nursing home care.  		The Los Angeles providers were AIDS Project LA, the second-largest AIDS service  		organization in the United States; AIDS Healthcare Foundation, an AIDS-specific  		freestanding outpatient medical provider that operates a Medicaid managed care  		plan for people with AIDS; and AltaMed Health Services Corporation, a community  		health center with an HIV/AIDS program that targets the Latino community.  		In-person discussions with key program staff took place in spring 1997.</p>
<p>Service providers reported that they are changing both the types of  		services offered and their service delivery approaches in response to growing  		numbers of disadvantaged clients who are living longer, healthier lives.  		Providers have found that service delivery models that worked well for earlier  		clients (namely, end-of-life care for affluent, well-educated gay men) must be  		modified for newer clients with longer-term and more complex problems (for  		example, behavioral comorbidities, lifelong poverty, and families also in need  		of support) and often tenuous informal support systems. Provider response has  		included broadening the range of services provided in house, increasing  		referrals to and interactions with providers in other systems, reconfiguring  		staffing to include more trained professionals and fewer lay staff and  		volunteers, and developing procedures to provide the most intense services to  		the clients with the most complex problems. These costly changes have been  		simultaneous with decreases in private donations and increased pressure to  		control Medicaid costs.</p>
<p>Only one case study provider had had substantial direct experience with  		managed care. Nevertheless, all the providers saw Medicaid managed care for  		their clients just over the horizon and were concerned that many questions  		about managed care for people with AIDS had not yet been answered: how to set  		payment rates and manage financial risk in a way that will promote quality  		medical care (that is, provide specialty care and state-of-the-art treatments);  		and whether and how to include under capitation home- and community-based care  		such as that now provided through Medicaid waivers and Ryan White. Providers  		were concerned that rational planning decisions would be difficult to make  		because of the scarcity of data on (1) current patterns of service use among  		different groups of people with AIDS, and (2) the cost-effectiveness of  		different types of home- and community-based services.</p>
<p>The project also sought information about the feasibility of using  		provider databases in future research efforts. The case study providers each  		maintained databases with the capacity to provide detailed sociodemographic and  		clinical data describing their clients, as well as data describing service use.  		However, providers noted that while databases contained fields for client  		characteristics, the fields were frequently not filled in. Providers stated  		their willingness to consider the inclusion of their databases in future  		research projects. However, formal permission to gain access to them must be  		requested and received and data from them examined for completeness and  		consistency before a research study can be undertaken.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Lessons from the New Jersey Medicaid AIDS Waiver Program </h2>
<p>The New Jersey Medicaid waiver program provided an important opportunity  		to study home- and community-based services for people with AIDS, for several  		reasons. First, the nation's AIDS population is evolving to look more like New  		Jersey's. In the early 1990s, of the state's AIDS population nearly one-fourth  		were females, more than two-thirds were nonwhites, and over half were injection  		drug users. Second, New Jersey has always emphasized home care in its AIDS  		services and policies. In 1987 its Medicaid program developed the nation's  		first home- and community-based service waiver for people with AIDS. Finally,  		the state has supported the development of a longitudinal research database  		that links Medicaid claims and AIDS registry data, facilitating analyses of  		AIDS service use among Medicaid beneficiaries. The portion of the database used  		for this report included 2,464 people who became eligible for Medicaid between  		August 1989 and July 1991 and who were diagnosed with AIDS by June 1992. The  		database describes their service use through June 1994. Of those 2,464  		beneficiaries, complete diagnosis-to-death claims data were available for  		1,293; this "completely observed" sample was the primary focus of the  		analysis.</p>
<p>About a third of the 1,293 beneficiaries voluntarily participated in the  		case-managed AIDS waiver program; the remainder were eligible for more limited  		home care under the regular Medicaid program. Program eligibility criteria  		include the need for a nursing home-level of care and either categorical  		Medicaid eligibility or financial eligibility if the beneficiary were  		institutionalized. Waiver participants were more likely than nonparticipants to  		be whites or males but less likely to be injection drug users. Only 20 percent  		of nonparticipants were whites, 60 percent were males, and 74 percent were  		injection drug users, as compared with 37, 75, and 62 percent of waiver program  		participants, respectively. Differences between waiver participants and  		nonparticipants may have been related to the waiver program's higher income  		cutoff.</p>
<p>Among nonparticipants, there were substantial disparities among  		beneficiaries from different racial groups and from transmission risk groups in  		the use of home care: whites were more likely than blacks, and injection drug  		users less likely than nonusers, to use home care. These large disparities were  		not evident among waiver participants. While it is difficult to separate the  		effects of the ability of the waiver program to improve access to care and the  		program's self-selection on the findings, they do suggest that case management  		may hold promise for improving access to home care for groups who make up  		increasing proportions of the AIDS population.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Planning and Policy Implications </h2>
<p>The challenges providers, planners, and policymakers face in the wake of  		a changing AIDS population and service environment have implications in three  		areas: (1) development of databases and other types of information to support  		planning decisions; (2) development of concrete strategies to implement managed  		care for people with AIDS; and (3) development of a cohesive approach to  		meeting the needs of people with all types of chronic illness.</p>
<p><b>In an environment that focuses increasingly on cost control, program  		planners and policymakers require information to aid in decision making about  		the provision of home- and community-based services to people with  		AIDS.</b></p>
<p>Two broad types of information are needed. The first is basic  		description of service use and of costs and variations in them over time, by  		geographic region, and by funding source. Service use and cost patterns should  		also differentiate among groups of people with AIDS who may be expected to have  		different use patterns (for example, as defined by HIV risk group, gender,  		minority status, disease stage, use of particular pharmaceutical treatments,  		presence of behavioral comorbidities, homelessness, or existence of family  		affected by HIV). Whereas basic information about service use patterns is  		sorely needed, more sophisticated analyses--which offer evidence that a  		particular program, approach, or financing mechanism provides care more  		cost-effectively--would further rationalize decision making for future  		programs.</p>
<p>Practice guidelines for home- and community-based services represent a  		second type of information whose development bears further consideration.  		Practice guidelines, such as those now widely used in home health care, could  		clarify the goals and tasks of home- and community-based services (often  		criticized for their amorphousness). Case management in particular has been  		faulted for its profusion among people with AIDS, and guidelines could be one  		part of a strategy to reduce redundancy in case management and help it  		coordinate services across systems more effectively.</p>
<p><b>While managed care holds the potential to better coordinate acute  		care and home- and communitybased services for people with AIDS, its  		implementation faces challenges beyond those posed by the information gaps just  		described.</b></p>
<p>Managed care planners face now well-known challenges in addressing the  		special medical care needs of people with AIDS: developing both risk management  		strategies that offer plans incentives to enroll people at risk of high costs  		and mechanisms to assure high-quality AIDS treatment. However, planners face  		additional challenges in addressing the needs of people with AIDS for home- and  		community-based services. If managed care planners decide to include these  		services under capitation payments, fundamental questions exist as to how to  		implement and integrate them. For example, who should coordinate and oversee  		their use: medical or social services providers? Small, neighborhood-based or  		larger, more comprehensive providers? These and other questions of  		implementation remain because most of the few managed care plans now serving  		substantial numbers of people with AIDS currently carve out home- and  		community-based support services. Even less is known about whether and how to  		integrate Ryan White funding and services under managed care. This suggests  		that demonstrations of managed care for people with AIDS must begin to  		integrate home- and community-based services with medical care.</p>
<p><b>The problems we face in figuring out whether and how AIDS-specific  		home- and community-based services should be included in managed care (or in  		ongoing fee-for-service programs facing costcontrol pressures) are merely  		special cases of general problems reflecting the need for a cohesive policy to  		address the needs of people with all types of chronic illnesses.</b></p>
<p>The health care and support service systems for people with chronic  		illnesses need to be flexible enough (1) to permit people to vary the intensity  		with which they receive services in those systems as their needs change over  		time, and (2) to minimize incentives to provide care at inappropriate levels.  		The current Medicaid and Medicare systems include perverse incentives that run  		counter to these goals. In addition, as the number of people with AIDS who are  		covered by Medicare (but not Medicaid) increases, the funding of support  		services and medications (not currently covered under Medicare) will be a  		particular problem, as it is now for all Medicare beneficiaries (and most  		privately insured individuals) with severe chronic illnesses. Public programs  		funding medical and support services must also give people with chronic  		illnesses the flexibility to return to work when they are well enough without  		jeopardizing access to the very services that make them healthy enough to work.  		This is a particular dilemma for people with AIDS who are successfully taking  		protease inhibitors funded by Medicaid or Ryan White.</p>
<p>In addition to providing general assistance with daily living activities  		or AIDS-specific assistance such as help with adherence to treatment regimens,  		support services for poor people with chronic illnesses, including AIDS, must  		mesh more closely with public assistance, family services, and housing  		providers, because subsistence needs must be met before health and traditional  		support services can be put in place. Similarly, support services for people  		with chronic illnesses and behavioral problems must work more closely with  		mental health and substance abuse treatment providers.</p>
<p>The similarities of the needs of disadvantaged people with AIDS to those  		of disadvantaged people with other types of chronic illnesses raises a question  		of equitability in support services funding. The Ryan White program has  		demonstrated that important service and funding gaps had to be filled for poor  		people with AIDS. These gaps almost surely exist for all poor people with  		severe chronic illnesses.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Research Agenda Recommendations </h2>
<p>The need for (1) data describing the use and effectiveness of home- and  		community-based services for people with AIDS, (2) managed care approaches that  		integrate home- and community-based services for people with AIDS, and (3) a  		cohesive national chronic-care policy give rise to the following research  		agenda recommendations:</p>
<p><b>Database Development</b>. There is a clear need both for large  		representative databases that can provide timely descriptions of home- and  		community-based service use among different groups of people with AIDS and for  		focused data collection to identify and evaluate promising interventions. Large  		administrative databases are representative and comprehensive, but they lack  		much data describing individual characteristics and suffer from processing lags  		that keep them from being as timely as desirable. Provider databases have the  		potential to add characteristics data and to be more timely, but they describe  		highly specific populations. Reports concerning the rates at which  		characteristics data are missing from provider databases lessen their appeal.  		Nevertheless, research efforts should focus on examining the feasibility of  		developing combined administrative databases and of using provider data to  		supplement them.</p>
<p><b>Practice Guideline and Quality Indicator Development</b>. Although  		their use is now becoming accepted practice in home health care, practice  		guidelines and quality indicators have not been used widely for other home- and  		community-based services. Although provider databases could be useful in  		developing benchmarks and testing specific approaches, development of  		guidelines and quality indicators usually relies on panels of experts and  		consumers. Research efforts should investigate the feasibility of developing  		such guidelines and indicators. A first step in this effort might include a  		review of the literature to identify any that already exist, followed by a  		meeting of experts and consumers to discuss the desirability of developing (or  		refining) them for specific services (for example, case management or treatment  		adherence assistance).</p>
<p><b>Identification of Evaluable Interventions</b>. In the course of its  		six case study visits, this project identified a number of interventions that  		could be considered for formal evaluation. However, a more focused approach  		could be taken to identifying interventions through the release of a request  		for proposals disseminated widely to AIDS providers. To encourage as many  		responses as possible by burdening providers as little as possible, the request  		process could follow a "foundation approach" in which (1) providers were asked  		to submit two-page letters describing their ideas, (2) a panel reviewed the  		letters, and (3) selected providers were then asked to submit longer  		proposals.</p>
<p><b>Development of Managed Care Demonstrations That Include Home- and  		Community-Based Services</b>. AIDS-specific demonstrations are needed that  		include under capitation home- and community-based services (such as those  		covered under regular Medicaid benefits, Medicaid waivers, and Ryan White  		funding) in order to fill knowledge gaps about whether and how such  		arrangements may best be implemented. Such demonstration efforts face a number  		of nontrivial challenges, including identifying appropriate host organizations,  		gathering a full range of service providers, and setting payment rates. In  		addition, any such demonstration should require the collection of encounter  		data to describe patterns of service use under capitation. Similarly, thought  		should be given to the design of a Medicare demonstration that provides  		beneficiaries with AIDS (who do not also have Medicaid) coverage of  		pharmaceuticals and support services.</p>
<p><b>Investigation of Return-to-Work Regulations</b>. Although the  		Supplemental Security Income program contains regulations that provide for the  		continuation of public benefits for people working with a "severe impairment,"  		it is not clear whether or how these regulations apply to people with AIDS who  		are being treated successfully with protease or some other therapy. Because  		AIDS medications are so costly, and thus the disincentive to work particularly  		strong, this area deserves further investigation and may suggest the need to  		revise existing regulations to reduce the work disincentives.</p>
<p><b>Development of Approaches to Better Link AIDS Services to Other  		Systems</b>. The level of contact between AIDS service providers and providers  		and entities in other systems--substance abuse treatment, mental health, family  		services, and public assistance--has increased greatly in recent years,  		primarily through increased referrals between systems. Yet AIDS providers in  		our case studies stated that there was not enough sharing of basic knowledge,  		particularly between AIDS providers and those in the substance abuse treatment  		and mental health systems. Coordination of efforts between these systems would  		be particularly important in developing strategies to help people with  		substance abuse problems or mental illness to adhere to AIDS treatment  		regimens. Research efforts should thus develop approaches for sharing knowledge  		and pooling resources between AIDS service providers and those in other systems  		that serve large numbers of people with AIDS.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>As AIDS increasingly becomes a disease of disadvantaged people, medical  		treatment and health-related support services begin to blend with traditional  		public assistance programs such as food stamps and housing assistance.  		Moreover, any changes in service delivery that result from changes in welfare  		or immigration policy will affect more directly an AIDS population growing  		poorer. As AIDS increasingly becomes a chronic, rather than an acute and fatal  		disease, its management resembles more closely that of other serious chronic  		conditions. Key challenges in developing costeffective models of  		chronic-disease management include figuring out how to help people take  		responsibility for their health (adhere to treatment regimens, maintain good  		self-care practices, and monitor and report symptoms) and how to provide them  		with the assistance and financial support they need to take this  		responsibility. Substance abuse treatment, mental health services, assisted or  		supportive living, interventions with families, assistance returning to work,  		and help locating safe and secure housing--all may have to play a bigger role  		in the delivery of home- and community-based services for newer AIDS  		populations than they did for gay men earlier in the epidemic.</p>
