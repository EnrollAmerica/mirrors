<hr /><h2>A. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Over the last several years, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human  		Services (DHHS) has been pursuing a number of research efforts to better  		understand the participation of persons with significant disabilities in  		competitive employment. As part of this effort, ASPE's Office of Disability,  		Aging, and Long-Term Care Policy (ODALTCP) has contracted with Lewin-VHI to  		conduct an exploratory study of the barriers that impede and incentives that  		encourage the labor force participation of persons with significant  		disabilities. Of particular importance is how DHHS programs and policies can  		interact with other federal agency, state, and private sector activities to  		help or hinder employment. DHHS programs Include the health care programs  		(Medicare and Medicaid), and the social service and aid programs including  		those of the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACF), the  		Administration for Developmental Disabilities, the Administration on Aging, and  		the research and service programs of the Public Health Service. Until March  		1995 the Social Security Administration (SSA) was part of DHHS, The programs of  		DHHS and SSA remain strongly linked. The objective of the project is to Inform  		and provide direction to ODALTCP's future research agenda for policyrelevant  		studies on issues under the purview of these programs.</p>
<p>Employment opportunities for persons with significant disabilities are  		an Important focus for public policies related to social service, income  		maintenance, and health insurance. Many people with disabilities want to work.  		Their participation in the labor force contributes to their independence and  		integration into society, provides tax revenues, and reduces income support  		program outlays. At the same time, many persons with disabilities are not able  		to work or to find work. Others may choose to pursue non-market activities  		rather than engage in work.</p>
<p>People with significant disabilities often need support Of some sort to  		engage in work including health care, vocational rehabilitation, personal  		assistance services, assistive devices, and employers accommodating their work  		environment and duties. How best to provide this support is an ongoing concern  		for policy makers.</p>
<p>This report contains the findings from five separate exploratory studies  		on issues related to the labor force participation of persons with  		disabilities. The report draws primarily from published studies in order to  		identify areas of research with conflicting claims and areas in which little or  		no research has been conducted. Based on the review of this body of research,  		we make recommendations for needed additional research in the specific areas  		studied. The studies included in this report examine:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>various aspects of the competitive labor market for persons with  			 disabilities, including factors affecting the labor supply of and demand for  			 disabled workers; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of personal assistance services and assistive devices by  			 disabled workers; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the impact of welfare reform strategies on persons with  			 disabilities; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>selected programs that offer comprehensive services io help persons  			 with significant disabilities participate in competitive employment. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In this summary report we first describe the conceptual framework used  		to approach each of these studies. We then provide an overview of the report  		and summarize the findings from each of the studies. We conclude this report  		with a discussion of the need for additional research to support the analysis  		and formulation of government policies that may have an impact on the  		employment of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>B. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</h2>
<p>In studying the factors that promote and discourage labor force  		participation among persons with disabilities, ft is useful to define a  		framework in which these factors may be organized, analyzed, and evaluated as  		to their ability to be addressed by public policy. Below, we describe the  		conceptual framework used in this report, discuss the policy option's implied  		by this framework, and briefly note some of the issues associated with defining  		"disability' in the study of the labor force participation of persons with  		disabilities.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. An Economic Perspective</h3>
<p>We approach this project from an economic perspective. That perspective  		emphasizes the role of individuals making choices between various alternatives  		as key to understanding behaviors such as labor force participation. A well  		developed theory of the labor market exists in the economics literature, and it  		is this theory that forms the conceptual framework and organizing scheme we use  		to present information on various factors that act as either barriers to or  		incentives for work among persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The basic economic theory of labor markets posits that the amount of  		labor individuals are willing to supply will depend on their preferences and an  		hours/earnings tradeoff. Individuals must choose how to allocate their limited  		time between (market) work activities and all other activities. Non-work  		activities are euphemistically called "leisure", but include all forms of  		unpaid work and self-care. Market work is necessary to obtain earnings, which  		are used to purchase goods and services. Therefore, the allocation of hours to  		market work and other activities represents a choice based on the individual's  		preferences and the tradeoff between the consumption of goods and services and  		the consumption of leisure.</p>
<p>Economic theory also posits that the amount of labor firms demand will  		be dependent upon the demand for the firm's product, the productivity of labor  		(and other inputs), the wage rate and other costs firms must incur to hire  		labor, and the costs associated with other inputs that are substitutes or  		complements to labor. The textbook profit-maximizing firm will demand that  		amount of labor at which the value of the additional output produced by the  		last worker hired is just equal to the cost of hiring that worker.</p>
<p>This economic view of how individuals decide how much labor to supply  		and how firms decide how much labor to demand is simple, but ft forms a basic  		framework in which predictions may be made and hypotheses may be tested. This  		basic J framework may also be modified and enhanced with details specific to  		the Issues under study, in this case, to the labor market for persons with  		disabilities.</p>
<p>For persons with disabilities, the tradeoff between work and leisure is  		likely to be influenced by the availability of other sources of income in the  		absence of work (disability benefits or spousal earnings, for example),  		availability of health insurance, which is often contingent on employment or  		public program participation, and the wage rate. Wage rates for persons with  		disabilities may be affected by the disability itself, as impairment may reduce  		productivity, influence employer perceptions of productivity, or be a source of  		discrimination by employers.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities me also be required to incur additional  		expenses in order to participate in the labor market, such as the costs of  		rehabilitation, special transportation, equipment, or personal assistance  		services. All else equal, these additional work-related expanses will make  		labor force participation less attractive or even render the net gains to  		working negative, unless paid by a third party.</p>
<p>In addition, the labor/leisure tradeoff and decision to work for persons  		with disabilities may be affected if disability reduces the number of hours  		available for work and leisure. Disability has been characterized as a  		condition that "steals time" (Oi, 1991). Persons with disabilities may require  		more time for personal care or medical care activities and, thus, have less  		time available for work. Assistance that helps reduce the time required for  		non-work activities, such as housework, may increase the time available for  		work and, hence, increase labor force participation.</p>
<p>The labor supply of persons with disabilities is in part determined by  		individual preferences, which are themselves likely to be influenced in a  		variety of ways by the presence of a physical or mental impairment. For  		example, Impairments often steal time by reducing life expectancy. Other things  		constant, it seems likely that the shorter an individual's life expectancy, the  		less the individual will want to work today.<font size="-2"><a href="#note1">1</a></font></p>
<p>The demand for workers with disabilities by firms will depend on the  		productivity of these workers and the costs the firm must incur to hire them,  		If disabled workers require special accommodations in order to work, the costs  		of these accommodations will be taken into account when deciding whether or not  		to hire workers with disabilities. In theory, if firms do not believe that a  		worker's compensation plus the cost of their investment in accommodations or  		their support for developing the worker's capabilities will be entirely offset  		by the worker's productivity, accommodation will not occur and workers with  		disabilities will not be hired. Economic theory predicts that, in a competitive  		labor market, if the government imposes labor regulations or a benefit mandate  		on employers, workers will bear the burden through lower wages and employment  		in the long-run. Regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act  		(ADA), may reduce the ability of employers to shift costs onto workers, but if  		the cost of a regulation to employers is high, enforcement of the regulation is  		likely to be difficult.</p>
<p>Institutional policies and practices associated with the labor market  		will also affect the demand for workers with disabilities. A forty-hour work  		week, wage sales that do not adjust for productivity, and other occupational  		rigidities may reduce the likelihood that persons with disabilities are hired.  		Some regulations may have a positive impact on employment and wages by reducing  		or eliminating such rigidities.</p>
<p>Changes in the macroeconomy (business cycles and economic restructuring)  		affect the demand for disabled workers just as the do the demand for other  		workers. Workers with disabilities, however, may find it more difficult to  		adjust to macroeconomic change than those without disabilities. Their  		disabilities and, in many cases, low skills may make it more difficult to find  		a new job, especially If available jobs require skills that they don't already  		have. Unemployment insurance and employment and training programs that have  		been designed for workers Without disabilities may be inadequate for the needs  		of those with disabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to the principal players in the labor market (individuals  		and firms), third parties have a direct or indirect interest in the lives of  		persons with disabilities and the behavior of the third parties may encourage  		or -discourage employment of those with disabilities. There is a broad social  		consensus that persons with disabilities deserve, or even have a right, to  		assistance from others. Such assistance comes from many sources including other  		family members, charitable organizations, and the various levels of government.  		The amount of assistance is often conditioned on the perceived financial need  		of the disabled person. Employment earnings are likely to reduce perceived  		need, thereby reducing assistance an "implicit tax" on earnings that may  		discourage work. At the same time, however, those who provide assistance have  		an interest in encouraging employment in order to reduce their own financial  		obligation. Thus, availability of public and private disability insurance  		benefits and welfare payments to a disabled individual may discourage the  		individual from working, but at the same time those who pay the benefits have a  		financial interest in encouraging work.</p>
<p>Other examples of interested third parties are state and local  		governments, which may encourage those with disabilities to obtain federal  		disability and health benefits to reduce state and local expenditures for  		income support and health care, and health care providers, who may encourage  		their patients with disabilities to apply for federal income support and health  		benefits. These actions may discourage employment because eligibility for  		federal benefits is conditioned on financial need.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">2. Defining Disability</h3>
<p>In studying the barriers and incentives to labor force participation of  		persons with disabilities, it is necessary to define the concept of'  		"disability" being used. Disability is a multi-faceted concept that represents  		the relationship between an individual and his or her environment. It typically  		refers to a limitation in functioning that stems from the presence of a  		physical or mental impairment. The definition becomes complex, however, because  		an individual who is limited in his or her ability to function in one  		environment may not be limited when components of that environment are modified  		or when functioning in alternative environments. In addition, disability status  		may be dependent on the skills or abilities an individual had prior to the  		onset of impairment and how the impairment has reduced or destroyed those  		abilities. For example, a concert pianist who loses her hand might be  		considered to have a work disability, whereas a singer who loses his hand may  		not be considered work disabled. Finally, a disability may itself constitute a  		barrier to the acquisition of skills.</p>
<p>For the most part, this report focuses on the ability of impaired  		individuals to adapt to the competitive labor market environment, taking that  		environment as given. Little consideration is given to a symmetric issue about  		which much less is known, namely the ability of the economy to provide  		employment opportunities to those with impairments.</p>
<p>The definition of disability used in the Americans with Disabilities Act  		serves as a useful starting point for defining disability:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Disability</i> means with respect to an individual (1) a physical  			 or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the <i>major life  			 activities</i> of such individual, (2) a record of such an impairment, or (3)  			 being regarded as having such an impairment." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Major life activities</i> means functions such as caring for  			 oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking,  			 breathing, learning, and working" (Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990).  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Because the focus of this report is the labor force participation of  		persons with disabilities, disability is viewed from the perspective of an  		individual's capacity to engage in work. This perspective in no way simplifies  		the concept of disability, nor its measurement in national surveys used to  		analyze work disability issues. In this report, we review studies of disability  		that use a variety of sources of information and data on disability. We  		therefore do not propose a standard definition of "disability", but rather,  		take care to describe the definition of disability used in each study whenever  		possible.</p>
<p>The major national surveys frequently used to study disability and labor  		force participation are the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the  		Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (SIPP). The NHIS uses activity limitations to define disability  		(inability to engage in major activity, imitation in amount or kind of major  		activity, and limitation in non-major activities). The CPS also uses  		self-reported activity limitation as an indicator of disability, but asks  		respondents if they are limited specifically in their ability to work, rather  		than a more general question concerning limitations in any major activities.  		The NHIS also uses functional limitations (need for personal assistance in  		activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living), and/or  		the presence of chronic health conditions as a basis for defining and measuring  		disability, as does the SIPP. A description of these and other surveys that may  		be used to study disability issues is presented in <a href="#EXHIBIT1">Exhibit  		I</a> at the end of this summary report.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">1. Literature Review</h3>
<p>If the employment of persons with disabilities is a desirable social.  		objective, then a better understanding of the factors affecting the labor  		market for disabled workers is a necessary starting point for the development  		of public policies to promote their employment. Therefore, we began our study  		with a review of the literature that describes the extent of labor force  		participation by persons, with disabilities and examines the major factors  		believed to affect the labor supply of persons with disabilities and the demand  		for disabled workers by firms. More specifically, we review: the historical  		trends in labor force participation of persons with disabilities; the  		characteristics of workers and working-age persons with disabilities; the  		earnings of workers with disabilities and evidence of wage discrimination; the  		impact of income support programs on labor supply; the availability of health  		insurance and incentives associated with health insurance contingent on program  		participation; the effect of business cycles and industrial restructuring on  		the employment of persons with disabilities; and workplace accommodations  		provided by employers. The principal findings of the literature review  		include:</p>
<h4 align="CENTER"><i>Trends in the Labor Force Participation and Earnings  		of Persons with Disabilities</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>The labor force participation of men, both with and without  			 disabilities has been steadily declining since the 1970s; the largest decline  			 has been among disabled men age 55-64 (Yelin, 1993).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The labor force participation of women, both with and without  			 disabilities has been increasing dramatically for those without disabilities  			 and steadily for those with disabilities since the 1970s. The greatest  			 increases were experienced by women age 18-44 (Yelin and Katz, 1994a).  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percent of disabled workers who are employed full-time has been  			 declining and rates of part-time employment have been increasing. In contrast,  			 full-time employment among workers without disabilities has remained relatively  			 constant, while part-time employment has increased, although not by as much as  			 for workers with disabilities (Yelin and Katz, 1994b). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, there was a substantial decline in the earnings of  			 workers with disabilities relative to those of workers without disabilities  			 during the 1980s (McNeil, 1989). There are many possible explanations of this  			 trend, but we have not found any study that attempts to determine the relative  			 importance of each one.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Characteristics of Disabled Workers</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Workers with severe disabilities are more likely to bi older, female  			 and black or Hispanic, and to have less education than workers without severe  			 disabilities (NIDRR, 1992).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workers with severe disabilities experience higher unemployment and  			 lower earnings than workers without severe disabilities and are more likely to  			 be employed in service or craft occupations or to be self-employed (NIDRR,  			 1992) (Mathematica Policy Research, 1990).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older workers who become disabled are substantially less likely to  			 return to work, less likely to recover from disability, and equally likely to  			 fall into poverty as younger individuals following the onset of disability  			 (Burkhauser and Daly, 1994b).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent study examined the employment changes among workers between  			 the ages of 51 and 61 after the onset of disability. Subsequent to the onset of  			 a disability, about one-fourth of workers change employers, about one-fourth  			 exit from the labor force, and approximately half remain with their original  			 employer. Within this group, labor force withdrawals were positively associated  			 with age and negatively associated with education (Daly and Bound,  			 1994).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>International Comparisons</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>We find little population-based cross-national research on the labor  			 force participation rates of persons with disabilities. Most cross-national  			 comparisons tie the definition of disability to receipt of disability  			 transfers. An exception is a comparison of labor force participation in the  			 U.S. and Germany using national sample data. The study shows that the overall  			 participation rates are approximately the same in the two countries, but that  			 working age men with disabilities in Germany are more likely to be working  			 full-time and receive higher earnings than their U.S. counterparts (Daly,  			 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.S. spends less in income support per person with a disability  			 than Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Within age groups, the U.S. had the  			 lowest rates for those aged 45 to 64, but the German rate was by far the lowest  			 for those aged 15 to 44: just five per thousand compared to 23 per thousand in  			 the U.S. The study attributes the low German rate for young workers to both the  			 rehabilitation focus of German policy and the relatively low income replacement  			 rate for younger transfer recipients (Aarts and DeJong, 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other Industrialized countries, particularly those of western  			 Europe, have a variety of incentives and supports to aid the labor force  			 participation of workers with disabilities. Among the types of programs  			 supported are disability allowances provided regardless of employment status,  			 hiring quotas, vocational rehabilitation, constant attendance allowances, wage  			 subsidies, job placement services, sheltered employment, payment for  			 work-related assistive technology, and universal health insurance (Aarts and  			 DeJong, 1094) (Zeftzer, 1994).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Income Support Programs and Their Effect on Labor  		Supply</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Four of the major programs (Supplemental Security Income (SSI),  			 Veterans Pensions, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and General  			 Assistance (GA)) are "means-tested"-eligibility requires that the individual's  			 or household's income and other resources fall below specified limits. Although  			 special provisions of these programs have been designed to encourage work, in  			 general any earnings are implicitly "taxed" by a reduction in benefits.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other four major programs (Social Security Disability Insurance  			 (DI), Workers Compensation (WC), Veterans Compensation (VC), and Private  			 Disability Insurance (PDI)) are designed to provide insurance benefits to  			 replace earnings for workers (including members of the armed forces) who suffer  			 significant reductions in earnings due to a disability. DI and PDI provide  			 benefits regardless of the cause of disability, and WC and VC provide benefits  			 for disabilities caused by a work-related injury. With the exception of VC and,  			 in some cases, WC, all benefits are lost if the recipient returns to work at a  			 sufficiently high level of earnings.</p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p>Some individuals qualify for benefits from multiple programs, and  			 the work disincentive from the combined programs may be substantially greater  			 than that from just one of them; it is the combined incentive that is relevant.  			 An important example is that the work disincentive associated with DI is very  			 low for a worker with high earnings because DI benefits replace a low share of  			 his or her earnings, but combined benefits from DI and PDI may replace as much  			 as two-thirds of earnings. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With some exceptions, individuals who quality for income payments  			 under these programs automatically quality for medical benefits, and the value  			 of these benefits is likely to be considerable for a person with  			 disabilities--perhaps larger than the income benefit itself. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The large, long-term decline in the labor force participation rates  			 of men between the ages of 45 and 64 is mirrored by the increase in the  			 percentage of men in this age group who are DI beneficiaries (Parsons, 1980). A  			 variety of evidence indicates that the increases in the generosity of DI  			 benefits relative to earnings does account for a significant share of the  			 decline in older male labor force participation rates, but that much of this  			 decline is due to other factors (Haveman and Wolfe, 1984) (Haveman, Wolfe, and  			 Warlick, 1987) (Bound, 1989) (Kreider, 1994). The share due to DI benefits has  			 not been precisely estimated. This literature does not include significant  			 analyses of the effects on women or younger men. The role of private disability  			 insurance alone and in combination with DI, has also been largely  			 ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The substantial literature on Worker's Compensation finds conclusive  			 evidence of the effect of WC benefits on work effort (Butler and Worall, I 985)  			 (Worall et al., 1988) (Johnson and Ondrich, 1990) (Krueger, 1990) (Meyer et al,  			 1991) (Currington, 1993). The strength of the estimated effect depends on the  			 nature of the program and the methodology used to estimate it. We have not  			 found a study that carefully reviews all of the WC literature and examines the  			 relationships between findings, the nature of the program, and methodology. The  			 findings of the studies reviewed for this report suggest that the substantial  			 increases in generosity of WC that occurred following federal legislation in  			 1972 may have contributed significantly to the decline in labor force  			 participation of older men, but to our knowledge, no one has attempted to  			 estimate the magnitude of this effect.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Health Insurance Coverage and Incentives to  		Work</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Working-age persons with disabilities are less likely to have  			 private insurance and are more likely to receive public health Insurance  			 through Medicare and Medicaid than the overall population (LaPlante,  			 1993).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working-age persons with disabilities use substantially more health  			 care services than persons without disabilities (Lewin-VHI, 1995a). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Average health care expenditures for those with disabilities are  			 more than seven times the average of those for persons without disabilities  			 (Lewin-VHI, 1995a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are compelling reasons to believe that high health care costs  			 and access to health insurance discourage labor force participation and  			 encourage participation in SSI and DI, but we have found no research that  			 examines the effect of these factors on labor force participation or program  			 participation of persons with disabilities. Research on the work disincentives  			 associated with high health care costs and access to public and private  			 insurance has focused on how the availability of Medicaid affects the labor  			 supply and AFDC program participation of young mothers. Although evidence of  			 work disincentives is mixed, the more recent and methodologically superior AFDC  			 studies find statistically significant and substantial effects (Blank, 1988)  			 (Winkler, 1990) (Moffit and Wolfe, 1992) (Yelowitz, 1994).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>The Effect of Impairment on Earnings</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the impact of poor health on  			 earnings, both through its impact on hours of work and on wages (Luft, 1975)  			 (Bartel and Taubman, 1979) (Ohirikos and Nestel, 1981). Fewer studies, however,  			 have focused specifically on the experience of persons with severe disabilities  			 or on the differences across individuals with different types of  			 impairments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent study that focuses on disability found that wage offers to  			 individuals with specific impairments range from 74 percent to 101 percent of  			 those to individuals without impairments, depending on impairment and holding  			 other important characteristics of the worker constants. This study also shows  			 that wage losses from specific impairments vary by gender: limitations to  			 mobility and strength reduce male wages more, and limitations to sensory  			 capacities and appearance reduce female wages more. The methodology used to  			 develop these estimates is complex and uses strong assumptions; hence these  			 results should be viewed with some caution (Baldwin, Zeager, and Flacco,  			 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A study that compares the earnings of persons before and after the  			 onset of disability indicates that women and persons with less than a high  			 school education experience the largest declines in average earnings following  			 the onset of disability (Surkhauser and Daly, 1994b).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Business Cycles and Industrial Restructuring</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>There is evidence that cyclical changes in the economy affect the  			 labor force; participation of persons with disabilities to a greater extent  			 than that of persons without disabilities (Yelin and Katz, 1994a).  			 Applications, and to a lesser extent, awards, for DI and SSI benefits are also  			 sensitive to the business cycle (Lewin-VHI, 1995b). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic restructuring reduces good job opportunities for disabled  			 workers with low skills, but may increase opportunities for those with  			 technical expertise. To date, however, there are no estimates of the magnitude  			 of the effects that economic restructuring has on workers with  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Wage Discrimination Against Persons with  		Disabilities</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Recent wage discrimination studies find that male and female workers  			 with disabilities receive wage offers that are, on average, 86 and 90 percent,  			 respectively, of those made to workers of the same gender without disabilities  			 and with comparable levels of measured productivity. These studies differ from  			 studies of the effect of impairment on earnings because they attempt to control  			 for productivity. It could be, however, that a substantial portion of the wage  			 differences reported is due to unmeasured differences in productivity (Baldwin  			 and Johnson, 1992a, 1992b).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Workplace Accommodations by Employers</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Only two national data sets have collected information on work  			 accommodation. The 1978 Survey of Disability and Work and the 1991 Health and  			 Retirement Survey. These surveys show that between one-fourth and one-third of  			 workers who become impaired are accommodated following the onset of their  			 conditions (Burkhauser, Butler, and Kim, 1994) (Daly and Bound, 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may be limited in its  			 ability to increase the prevalence of accommodation for economic reasons. Costs  			 of accommodation would be expected to rise and the ability of employers to  			 shift those costs onto workers will be reduced under the ADA (Chirikos, 1991).  			 There is, however, no empirical research currently available to support this  			 theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work accommodation has been shown to increase the length of time a  			 worker will remain at his job following the onset of a limitation (Burkhauser,  			 Butler, and Kim, 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among persons who continue to work following the onset of  			 disability, most (66 percent) remain with their current employer. Those who  			 stay at the same job are more likely to be accommodated than those who change  			 employers; however, those who change jobs are significantly more likely to  			 experience a reduction in job demands (Daly and Bound, 1994).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">2. Personal Assistance Services and Assistive  		Technologies</h3>
<p>We examined the literature on the use of personal assistance services  		and assistive devices, respectively, and evidence of their potential impact on  		labor force participation of persons with disabilities. Information on the  		types, costs, mode of financing, and place of use (home or workplace) is  		presented in order to identify use-related issues that affect the propensity of  		individuals with disabilities to work or that influence the productivity of  		workers with disabilities. The most important findings are:</p>
<h4 align="CENTER"><i>Use of PAS by Workers</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>In our review of existing research, we found that very little is  			 known about the use of personal assistance services by workers with  			 disabilities, and even less is known for those with severe disabilities. We  			 cannot determine the prevalence of the use of PAS in the work place or if the  			 provision of PAS at home enables people to join the work force. We have  			 difficulty assessing how many people are using personal assistance services,  			 even on a national level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research to date has not adequately addressed the effectiveness  			 of potential public policy changes. The research we found had been conducted or  			 commissioned by a small number of research organizations that also have an  			 advocacy orientation. These analyses tend to be hampered by insufficient sample  			 sizes, unrepresentative samples, inadequate measures of disability, and limited  			 detail on personal assistance services required and received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information available suggests that a relatively small  			 proportion (less than one million) of the working-age population needs PAS.  			 Data from the 1990/1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)  			 revealed that 2.6 percent of the working age population or 3.7 million people  			 (between 21 and 64) needed personal assistance with at least one activity of  			 daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activity of daily living (IADLs) (McNeil,  			 1993). Of these people, 20.6 percent, or 763,000, were employed. Analyses of  			 data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) conducted by  			 Lewin-VHI revealed that 1.3 percent of the population under 65 needed  			 assistance or supervision with one or more of their ADLs (see Appendix 1 for a  			 breakdown of PAS utilization in the general population).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Access to PAS Among Workers</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>For workers who do receive formally provided personal assistance  			 services, funding is not likely to be provided by public sources (Utvak, 1994).  			 Most publicly funded programs that provide PAS exclude people who could be  			 employed, for several reasons. First, many public PAS programs have strict  			 means-testing that acts as a disincentive to work. Working may mean that the  			 person with a disability would have to purchase services on their own (Nosek,  			 1990). Second, some PAS programs, such as those funded by the Older Americans  			 Act, require that the PAS recipient be elderly. This may partially explain why  			 the PAS population tends to be concentrated more among the elderly (Litvak,  			 1991). Elderly PAS users are probably much more likely to be retired and not  			 working. Third, many programs require strict limitations in activities of daily  			 living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) or that the  			 person be at risk for institutionalization, so only those with very severe  			 disabilities are eligible. Such persons are the least likely to be employed  			 (Louis Harris &amp; Associates, 1986, 1994; McNeil, 1993; World Institute on  			 Disability and Rutgers University Bureau of Economic Research, 1990).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public programs that do minimize work disincentives allow: (1)  			 recipients to employ their own assistants, (2) encourage people to obtain  			 management training through Independent Living Centers, (3) allow for  			 24-hour-a-day services, and (4) have no income limit or have an income, asset  			 and allowable deduction limit generous enough to encourage individuals to  			 work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have programs that provide PAS which  			 attempt to eliminate work disincentives. Massachusetts allows for a Medicaid  			 buy-in, that is individuals with income above the financial eligibility  			 criteria can purchase Medicaid coverage on a sliding fee scale, Pennsylvania,  			 which uses Social Services Block Grant Funds to support PAS, does not impose an  			 income or resource eligibility criteria (poverty level enrollees pay no fee and  			 others pay on a sliding scale).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know very little about the extent to which private employers  			 compensate for this lack of publicly funded assistance by providing assistance  			 themselves. Two studies suggest that a substantial number of companies make  			 some kind of accommodation for people with disabilities (Berkeley Planning  			 &amp; Associates, 1981; Louis Harris &amp; Associates, 1987). However, we do  			 not have information on what types of personal assistance were being provided,  			 who is providing this assistance, who pays for it, and what role it plays in  			 allowing the person to enter and remain in the work force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recipient's ability to pick and choose which services will be  			 provided may determine how successful the services are in assisting the person  			 to work. Persons with disabilities pay for much of their assistance themselves  			 or receive specified services through public programs which are often  			 means-tested. Although cash benefits or vouchers provide ultimate consumer  			 control (a major theme among groups within the disability community) very few  			 public programs offer participants the opportunity to receive cash benefits  			 (Litvak, 1991a). Several European countries provide cash benefits that give  			 workers with disabilities greater discretion for the use of PAS to assist in  			 their employment. Issues regarding accountability for and efficient use of  			 public funds are often raised as reasons to limit consumer control.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Use of Assistive Technology by Workers</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>The financing of AT for workers with disabilities is  			 fragmented--there is no central source of public or private funds for AT for  			 workers with disabilities. The most important source of funding is private,  			 out-of-pocket expenditures made by the users of AT and their families.  			 Unfortunately, many potential users of AT and their families lack the resources  			 needed to purchase AT. Public funding is divided among numerous federal and  			 state programs, each with its own potential clientele, types of AT funded, and  			 restrictions on the use of AT funding. The federal government has also passed a  			 considerable amount of legislation, including modifications to the tax code,  			 that encourage or even mandate the funding of some AT by third  			 parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no "typical" AT user--AT Is often commercially available  			 products used by workers with and without significant disabilities and  			 impairments. AT can help workers with numerous and/or severe physical  			 impairments function on and off the job, but AT is less successful in helping  			 workers with mental impairments cope with their job requirements. Finally, AT  			 is being designed that provide workers with disabilities with "access" in the  			 workplace, rather than "adapting" the workplace to meet the particular needs of  			 these workers, (DeWitte, 1991), (Ward, 1992), (NCD, 1993), (Tan and Morowitz,  			 1993), (Beattie, 1991), (Scaddon, 1991), (Vanderheiden, 1991a), (Hauger,  			 1991a), (Kauppi and Dzubak, 1992), (Phillips and Zhao, 1993), (Mann and Svosai,  			 1994), (NIDRR, 1992), (Horstmann, Levine, and Kett, 1990), and (Vagnoni and  			 Horvath, 1992).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Careful selection of appropriate AT and training in its use is  			 essential--for AT to be most useful, there must be careful communication  			 between workers with disabilities, their employers, and AT professionals to  			 define the requirements of each job, the abilities and limitations of each  			 worker, and appropriate AT and related services allowing workers with  			 disabilities to meet their ' job requirements. To insure success, workers with  			 disabilities need training in the use of AT, and employers and AT professionals  			 need to provide continued technical assistance and to conduct periodic  			 reassessments of the needs of workers with disabilities. (Phillips, 1989),  			 (Steinfeld and Angelo, 1992), (Kimmel, Ourand, and Wheatley, 1992), (Lysaght  			 and Hurlburt, 1992), (ABLEDATA, 1992), (The President's Committee on Employment  			 of Persons with Disabilities, 1994), and (NARIC, 1993a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many unmet needs and other barriers limiting the use of AT  			 potential users of AT on the job often cannot afford to buy these items  			 themselves, and other sources of funding are often limited. Many workers with  			 disabilities are also unaware of products that now exist that can assist them  			 on the job. Many users of AT are not trained in the use of their AT, while  			 others feel that using some AT may isolate them from their coworkers and other  			 members of society. (Enders, 1990), (NCD, 1993), (Phillips, 1989), (Ward,  			 1992), (Laplante, Hendershot, and Moss, 1992), (Weaver, 1991), (Dean and Dolan,  			 1993), (GAO, 1993), (Horstmann, Levine, and Kett, 1990), (Vanderheiden, 1991a  			 and 1991b).</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">3. Impact of Welfare Reform</h3>
<p>The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program is a  		means-tested income support program that provides cash benefits to needy  		children deprived of parental support because a parent is absent from the home,  		incapacitated, deceased, or unemployed. Support may also be provided to others  		in the household, and is usually provided for the caretaker of such children,  		AFDC recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid insurance coverage.  		Each state determines the eligibility requirements (within federal guidelines)  		and benefit levels. The program is financed through a combination of state and  		federal funds, with federal funds covering from 50 to 80 percent of benefit  		costs and 50 percent of the administrative costs associated with the program  		(Committee on Ways and Means, 1994).</p>
<p>The AFDC program has been the target of many proposed welfare reform  		strategies designed to promote labor force participation of recipients and  		decrease AFDC caseloads. In 1986, the passage of the Family Support Act  		introduced many of these reforms. The Act established the Job Opportunity and  		Basic Skills (JOBS) program which is to provide education, training, and job  		placement for AFDC recipients. The Family Support Act also established  		"transitional Medicaid benefits" under which Medicaid coverage may be extended  		for twelve months to families who leave the AFDC rolls due to increased  		earnings.</p>
<p>Welfare reform strategies are again being debated and proposed at both  		the federal and state levels. President Clinton's proposed Work and  		Responsibility Act limits the receipt of AFDC to two years for most recipients,  		increases the percentage of recipients who must participate in the JOBS  		program, and restructures benefits to increase work incentives. Many states are  		currently conducting welfare demonstrations that incorporate one or more of  		these proposed reforms. Proposals that would presumably make it easier for  		states to implement reforms without federal approval are also being debated in  		Congress.</p>
<p>We investigated the impact of welfare reform strategies designed to  		encourage labor force participation of AFDC recipients with disabilities and  		recipients with disabled children. This is an important issue given the finding  		that approximately one in five women aged 15 to 45 on AFDC have some type of  		impairment, and approximately one in eight have a child with a disability  		(Adler, 1993). We reviewed the feature on labor force participation of AFDC  		recipients, the prevalence of disability in the AFDC population, and on the  		relationship between work incentives, health status, and labor force  		participation of AFDC recipients. The key findings of this review include:</p>
<h4 align="CENTER"><i>Findings from General Studies of AFDC</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>The findings from studies of the labor supply effects and work  			 incentives associated with the AFDC program indicate: the program does have a  			 significant negative impact on the labor supply of recipients (a reduction in  			 hours worked from 10 to 50 percent); benefit levels negatively affect the  			 probability of exiting AFDC; and changes in the benefit reduction rate for  			 additional earnings do not have any not impact on the labor supply of female  			 household heads--the increased work effort of existing recipients is offset by  			 the decreased effort of new recipients drawn to the rolls by the change in the  			 benefit reduction rate (Moffit, 1992).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies of the duration of time spent on AFDC estimate that about 75  			 percent of new recipients would be affected by a two-year time limit on benefit  			 receipt; that is, they would remain on AFDC for more than two years in the  			 absence of an imposed limit (Ellwood, 1986). Those most likely to exit AFDC are  			 those with higher wages, more education, and those with fewer children (Moffit,  			 1992).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies of the impact of training programs on the earnings of AFDC  			 recipients show that such programs have a positive effect on earnings and that  			 the costs associated with these programs are offset by reduced AFDC payments  			 after two to five years. These studies also show, however, that the earnings  			 gains do not typically lift families out of poverty and that training programs  			 are least successful in raising the earnings of long-term AFDC recipients  			 (Gueron and Pauly, 1991).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Findings with Respect to Recipients with  		Disabilities</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Studies of the prevalence of disability in the adult AFDC population  			 show that 11 percent have a disability that is work limiting, and 19 percent  			 have a functional impairment. The prevalence of disability among female AFDC  			 recipients is about twice that of women in the general population (Adler, 1993)  			 (Wolfe and Hill, 1993).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The findings of a study of the impact of reform strategies on AFDC  			 recipients with health impairments indicate that the labor force participation  			 of recipients with impairments is much less sensitive to changes in benefit  			 levels and wage subsidies than that of healthy AFDC recipients. This study also  			 showed that the provision of health insurance independent of AFDC participation  			 would have a substantial positive impact on the labor force participation of  			 both healthy and impaired recipients (Wolfe and Hill, 1995).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few studies have shown that recipients with disabilities do remain  			 on the AFDC rolls longer than recipients without disabilities; however, the  			 statistical significance of these findings has not been adequately demonstrated  			 (Plotnick, 1983) (Shea, 1992) (Adler, 1993).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A study that examines the likelihood of AFDC recipients with  			 disabilities to work, to leave the rolls, and to leave the rolls with earnings  			 found that those with disabilities are not significantly less likely to leave  			 the rolls, but are significantly less likely to leave the rolls with earnings.  			 This study also estimates that 30 to 40 percent of recipients with functional  			 limitations do work at some time during the first year on AFDC (Acs and  			 Loprest, 1994).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several studies demonstrate that recipients with disabilities may  			 encounter difficulties participating in work or training programs. A recent  			 survey of JOBS enrollees conducted at seven sites found that nearly one in five  			 enrollees believed they were unable to engage in education or training  			 activities because of a health or emotional problem (Office of the Inspector  			 General, 1992) (Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, 1994).</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Findings with Respect to AFDC Children with  		Disabilities</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>The prevalence of disability among children in families on AFDC is  			 5.4 percent compared to 3.7 percent in the general population (Mathematica  			 Policy Research, 1990). Other studies have shown that 7.5 percent of AFDC  			 families have a child with a disability (Acs and Loprest, 1994) and that female  			 recipients with disabilities are about twice as likely to have disabled  			 children as female recipients without disabilities (22.6 percent versus 10.4  			 percent) (Adler, 1993).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence of the effect of a disabled child on maternal labor  			 supply, and labor supply of AFDC mothers in particular, is mixed. Studies  			 including all mothers or all single mothers have generally found a negative  			 impact of a child's disability on maternal labor supply. However, a few studies  			 have either found no impact or, in a few cases, a positive effect on maternal  			 labor supply (Salkever, 1982) (Mauldon, 1992) (Wolfe and Hill, 1993) (Acs and  			 Loprest, 1994).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We also interviewed AFDC administrators in eight states to obtain  		information about how their programs and policies provide work incentives or  		disincentives for recipients with disabilities, a subject about which little is  		currently known. The states we selected were chosen based on the nature of  		their recent welfare reforms: Colorado, Florida, South Dakota, and Vermont  		limit the duration of benefit receipt; Iowa, Oregon, and Utah require  		recipients to participate in employment or training activities in order to  		receive benefits, and impose immediate sanctions for noncompliance; New York  		requires those AFDC applicants who may be eligible for Supplemental Security  		Income (SSI) to apply for SSI in order to receive benefits. The findings from  		these interviews include:</p>
<h4 align="CENTER"><i>Findings from the State Welfare Agency  		Interviews</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>Disability is a factor in determining eligibility for AFDC benefits  			 (usually in the case of a two parent family) and in determining exemption from  			 JOBS participation. Persons with disabilities are generally exempted from JOBS  			 participation. Programs in most of the selected states have two sets of  			 criteria to determine disability: one set for determining AFDC eligibility, and  			 another, more strict set, for determining JOBS exemption. The JOBS programs has  			 offered a setting for a more comprehensive assessment of persons with  			 disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the JOBS programs in these states, most do not have specific  			 provisions or procedures that directly relate to participants with  			 disabilities; however, most do provide individualized services for all  			 participants, allowing those participants with disabilities to have any special  			 needs addressed. It is extremely rare, though, for an individual with  			 disabilities who is exempt from JOBS to participate voluntarily. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AFDC programs in these states refer individuals with  			 disabilities primarily to SSI and Vocational Rehabilitation. Some programs also  			 make referrals to alcohol and drug treatment centers, mental health providers,  			 and Veterans' Affairs. Some programs require recipients to apply for other  			 benefits (e.g. SSI, Unemployment Insurance) in order to receive AFDC  			 benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These AFDC programs identify children with disabilities only when it  			 is an issue for exemption from JOBS. Most of the programs do not automatically  			 exempt recipients from JOBS if their child has disabilities and is on SSI.  			 Recipients must show that they must care for the child fulltime in order to be  			 exempt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utah's Single Parent Employment Demonstration (SPED) is unique in  			 that it does not allow any exemptions to the program even for persons with  			 disabilities, who are typically exempted from employment programs in other  			 states. SPED requires all recipients to participate in some type of  			 income-increasing activity, ranging from employment to applying for SSI  			 benefits. SPED also allows a one-time crisis need payment in order to help the  			 recipient get over the crisis and prevent them from becoming  			 recipient.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">4. Descriptions of Selected Programs</h3>
<p>For the final exploratory study, we identified and examined four  		promising programs that provide comprehensive employment-oriented services to  		people with significant disabilities. For each program, we present information  		on the population served by the program, the vocationalrelated services it  		offers, sources of referrals and funding for the program, and evidence of  		success. We also discuss the distinguishing components of each program, and  		offer possible explanations for their apparent success in placing their clients  		in competitive jobs. It should be kept in mind that these programs are not  		representative of all training and rehabilitation programs for people with  		disabilities, nor are they known to be "the best." The main findings are:</p>
<h4 align="CENTER"><i>Program Characteristics and Clients</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>San Francisco Vocational Services (SFVS) offers comprehensive  			 vocational services, including evaluation and assessment of skills and  			 interests, vocational and skills training, job search skills training, and job  			 placement. SFVS mainly serves individuals with visual, orthopedic, or emotional  			 disabilities, most of whom have severe disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career Design, Inc, (CDI) focuses on providing a variety of  			 evaluation and job placement services in its Worknet program. In addition,  			 CDI's private sector program provides case management and job placement  			 services for workers' compensation cases. CDI's Worknet program serves  			 individuals with a wide variety of disabilities, including those with  			 orthopedic disabilities, mental illness, mental retardation, and visual  			 impairments. The majority of Worknet clients have severe disabilities, CDI's  			 private sector program provides services for workers' compensation cases, and  			 most of these clients have musculoskeletal impairments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thresholds' comprehensive vocational services include vocational  			 assessment, skills and social training, job placement, and ongoing mobile job  			 support. Thresholds serves only those with severe mental illness, the majority  			 of whom are diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vocational Rehabilitation Department (VRD) of the Rehabilitation  			 Institute of Chicago (RIC) offers comprehensive vocational services including  			 vocational evaluation, internships, job seeking skills training, and job  			 placement. VRD serves mainly those with neurological impairments.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Program Outcomes</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>SFVS served 437 individuals in 1994, 114 of whom participated in its  			 job placement program. Of the 114 in its job placement program, 100 (87  			 percent) were placed into competitive employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDI served 408 individuals in its Worknet program in 1994, and 59  			 percent of these participants were placed into competitive employment. CDI also  			 provided services for 238 workers, compensation cases in 1994, and 62 percent  			 of these cases were successfully resolved.<font size="-2"><a href="#note2">2</a></font> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thresholds served 2,803 clients in 1994. Of the clients in day  			 programs who were receiving vocational services, approximately 80 percent were  			 employed while in Thresholds. This represents 50 percent of all individuals who  			 participated in day programs.<font size="-2"><a href="#note3">3</a></font> Six  			 months after leaving Thresholds, the percent who remained employed ranged from  			 34 to 45 percent of all day program clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIC's VRD serves approximately 700 individuals each year, a portion  			 of whom have job or training placement as a goal. In 1994, 184 clients in VRD  			 had placement as a goal, and 84 percent of these individuals were successfully  			 placed.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Replicability of Key Program Features</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>All of the programs provide a comprehensive range of services that  			 are individually tailored to meet each client's specific needs and goals, and  			 three of the programs' administrators cite their comprehensive and  			 individualistic approach as a key to their success. The one remaining program  			 cited its strong connection to the business community as a key to its success;  			 other programs also had connections to the business community, but they did not  			 specifically cite the connections as keys to their success,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It appears that many of the characteristics of the programs, though  			 often unique, are replicable it does not appear that these distinguishing  			 characteristics can only exist within particular programs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 align="CENTER"><i>Obstacles to Evaluation</i></h4>
<ul><li>
<p>In general, there is insufficient information to distinguish between  			 the impact of the program on successful employment outcomes and the extent to  			 which the program selects clients who have a high probability of success even  			 without participation in the program. It is possible that the success of the  			 program is due to the services it provides; however, it is also possible that  			 the program may only select and serve individuals who have characteristics  			 (e.g. motivation, work experience, skills) that enable them to be easily  			 placed. Ray Sakalas, Director of the Vocational Rehabilitation Department for  			 the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, commented that the criteria for  			 selecting individuals to become clients of a program have become more rigorous  			 due to the Federal Department of Rehabilitation's movement towards basing  			 funding for programs on their ability to place clients into employment. The  			 result is that programs may select only those individuals who have  			 characteristics that make them easy to place, and not accept individuals who  			 are more difficult to place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs define the terms "success" and "placement" differently. For  			 example, some programs only consider a person placed if he/she remains in a  			 competitive position for at least 60 days, while others may consider a person  			 placed if they hold any job for at least one day,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs differ on which clients are included in computing the  			 placement rate. Some programs may compute the placement rate for all clients  			 who participate In the program, but others may include only clients who were  			 interested in obtaining a job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs focusing on workers' compensation determine success by how  			 the case was resolved, not necessarily by how many clients we're placed into  			 employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs differ in their objectives and the services they offer. For  			 example, programs that have job placement as their primary goal only provide  			 services that are focused on placing their clients into employment. Their  			 success in placing clients, then, may be higher than other programs that  			 include job placement as only one of several goals of the program, and  			 therefore only devote some of their resources to placing clients.</p>

<h2>D. NEED FOR FUTURE POLICY-RELEVANT RESEARCH ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF  		PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES</h2>
<p>As the summary in Section C indicates, a substantial amount is known  		about the employment of persons with disabilities, but much more information is  		needed to assist the government in analyzing the impact of current policies on  		the employment of persons with disabilities and in formulating policies that  		are designed to increase their participation in competitive employment. In this  		section we present our recommendations for further policy-relevant research. We  		begin by briefly describing some guidelines that we followed in the development  		of our recommendations. These guidelines are based in part on the findings  		reported in the previous section, but also reflect our understanding of the  		interests of the ODALTCP and of the ongoing debate about employment policy for  		working-age persons with disabilities.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. Guidelines for the Development of a Research  		Agenda</h3>
<p>The following observations guided our thinking in the development of the  		research agenda:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>The main objective of the research agenda is to contribute to  			 understanding of barriers and incentives to employment opportunities for  			 persons with disabilities</i>. In recent years substantial interest has emerged  			 in improving opportunities for people with disabilities to join, remain in, or  			 return to the workforce. A growing consensus has emerged among disability  			 advocates that increasing employment opportunities of persons with disabilities  			 will both improve their wellbeing and increase their contribution to society.  			 Removing existing barriers to employment and creating employment incentives is  			 believed to be a powerful and cost-effective--perhaps even cost-saving--way to  			 improve the well-being of those with disabilities because it will allow them,  			 as well as society in general, to take better advantage of their productive  			 potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>There is a high premium on policy relevance</i>. The ASPE Office  			 of Disability, Aging, and Long-Term Care is interested in how its research on  			 independent living, long-term supports, and health services for people with  			 disabilities can be applied to the area of employment. Our suggestions for new  			 research are mostly relevant for DHHS policies. However, we also recognize the  			 importance of research. that is relevant to policies lying within the purview  			 of other departments and agencies--especially the newly independent Social  			 Security Administration, the Department of Education, and the Department of  			 Labor--as well as the importance of inter- agency coordination of policies that  			 have an impact on persons with disabilities. Collaborative projects with other  			 agencies are possible. Information on the costs of policies and programs and on  			 direct and indirect benefits to individuals, the government, and society as a  			 whole is a high priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Good research and public policy must recognize the heterogeneity  			 of the population of people with disabilities</i>. In the past, research has  			 often failed to specify or focus on particular groups of persons with  			 disabilities. Policies that do not recognize this fact may be very inefficient  			 and inequitable. At the same time, policies that do recognize this fact will be  			 difficult or impossible to implement if they require detailed information about  			 the characteristics of persons with disabilities and their jobs. Hence,  			 feasible policies that recognize the heterogeneity of persons with disabilities  			 must give individual decision-makers--the individual, government agents,  			 employers, and others--considerable flexibility to adapt assistance to the  			 individual's specific circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Although the focus of the research agenda is employment, research  			 on other aspects of the lives of people with disabilities is very relevant</i>.  			 The challenges that disabled persons face at home or elsewhere can deter  			 participation in the labor force. Thus, policies that impact any aspect of the  			 life of a person with disabilities may have direct or indirect effects on their  			 employment--sometimes intended, but often not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Other things equal, research that simultaneously addresses many  			 issues is more valuable than separate research projects on individual  			 issues</i>. There is a need to integrate, or at least coordinate, the many  			 aspects of disability policy, but this is difficult to do when analysis is  			 confined to addressing each aspect in isolation. Research that jointly examines  			 a wide variety of approaches to promoting employment (financial incentives,  			 rehabilitation, training, employer accommodations, assistive technologies,  			 personal assistance services, etc.) and their relative costeffectiveness should  			 be encouraged.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">2. A Research Agenda</h3>
<p>The following list of major research and policy issues below reflects  		the guidelines presented in the previous section, For each issue, we provide a  		brief discussion of its importance and briefly discuss possibilities for  		research that would address the issue. We group the recommendations into five  		categories: welfare, health, personal assistance services and assistive  		technologies, employment strategies, and other. These issues do not exhaust the  		potentially useful research that could be done. Other possibilities are  		discussed in the first section of each chapter in the larger report.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">a. Public Income Support and Insurance Programs</h4>
<ol><li>
<p><i>What are the effects of welfare reforms and demonstrations that  			 do not exempt mothers with disabilities or mothers who have children with  			 disabilities on the mothers' employment, family well-being, and AFDC  			 participation</i>? Most welfare reforms and demonstration projects that  			 encourage the employment and economic independence of welfare recipients exempt  			 those with disabilities, and those whose children have disabilities (Chapter  			 III). Utah's current demonstration program is an exception. Under this program,  			 individualized plans to increase income from other sources (primarily from  			 work, but also from other sources, including SSI and DI) are developed and  			 implemented for all recipients. An evaluation that focused on the success of  			 this or similar programs in promoting employment for recipients with  			 disabilities, or recipients whose children have disabilities, could be expected  			 to provide useful information about the potential for helping such recipients  			 achieve that goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>How might the JOBS program be changed to encourage participation  			 and employment by welfare recipients with disabilities and improve their  			 family's' well-being</i>? We found no information on the effectiveness of  			 training programs for AFDC recipients with disabilities, but did find evidence  			 that many persons who have self-reported health or emotional problems that make  			 them unable to participate in education and training are enrolled in JOBS. An  			 evaluation of how health problems are addressed in JOBS programs and the  			 cost-effectiveness of JOBS for recipients with severe mental and physical  			 impairments would seem warranted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What are the effects of work incentives and disincentives in the  			 SSI and DI programs</i>? What would be the employment and program participation  			 effects of changes in the implicit SSI tax on earnings and in the DI benefit  			 "cliff"? What will be the employment and other impacts of the new three-year  			 time limit on benefits awarded on the basis of drug and alcohol abuse?</p>
</li>
</ol><h4 align="CENTER">b. Health</h4>
<ol><li>
<p><i>To what extent do restrictions on access to health care and  			 health insurance deter the labor force participation of persons with  			 disabilities</i>? There are strong reasons to believe that high health care  			 costs and lack of access to public health insurance for disabled workers are a  			 significant barrier to employment for persons with disabilities, but we have  			 found no direct, rigorous evidence that this barrier deters a substantial  			 number of disabled workers from competitive employment. Empirical evidence is  			 necessary, both to demonstrate the importance of this effect and to quantity  			 the impact of policies that break the links between health insurance and  			 employment, SSA program participation, and tax revenue. The following  			 approaches might be considered:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Aaron Yelowltz (UCLA) is currently studying the relationship  				  between the value of Medicaid benefits and participation in the adult SSI  				  disability program. Differences across states and over time in the value of  				  Medicaid benefits may have an impact on participation at the state level. H  				  this line of research is successful, it could be extended to examine the impact  				  of Medicaid provisions on employment and taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluations of Medicaid demonstration programs that have the  				  effect of increasing the availability of Medicaid to low-income workers with  				  disabilities could include specific examination of this issue. ODALTCP is  				  already providing support for such work, in conjunction with evaluations  				  sponsored by the Health Care Financing Administration. Evaluation of Medicaid  				  buy-in programs, such as that in Massachusetts, is also warranted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of the provision of health insurance for the  				  success of employment programs could be examined as part of rigorous  				  evaluations of such programs (see below). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A careful study of Hawaii's experience with employer mandates,  				  state subsidized health insurance for low-income individuals who are not  				  covered by employer insurance and who are not poor enough to qualify for  				  Medicaid, and a generous Medicaid benefit for people with disabilities might  				  provide strong evidence on this issue. Econometric analysis of state-level SSI  				  growth in Hawaii for the 1988 to 1992 shows that growth in Hawaii was very low  				  in comparison to other states, especially after adjusting for other factors  				  that had an impact on growth (LewinVHI, 1995). An evaluation would need to  				  focus on changes in employment of persons with disabilities, and would need to  				  distinguish between the role of Hawaii's health care financing system and other  				  possible explanations of Hawaii's experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The historical experience of other countries in implementing  				  universal health care might also provide valuable information on this issue.  				  Observers of western European experience suggest that universal coverage does  				  play a positive role in the employment of people with disabilities in those  				  countries, but a more systematic analysis is needed to support this  				  observation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simulations of the employment effects of health insurance could  				  be conducted using a major survey database (e.g., the 1990 SIPP or the 1994-96  				  NHIS) along with the best available evidence on behavioral responses.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i>What impacts are current changes in employer-provided health  			 insurance--particularly the growth of managed care--having on the employment  			 and wells being of workers with disabilities</i>? Employer efforts to contain  			 the growth of their own health care expenditures have resulted in rapid growth  			 of managed care and other methods to control costs. The theoretical impact of  			 these changes on employment of workers with disabilities Is ambiguous. On the  			 one hand, controlling cost growth reduces the burden that workers with high  			 health care utilization may place on an employer, on the other hand, managed  			 care insurers may limit access to care that is critical to employees with  			 disabilities. One way to examine this issue would be to identify cases where  			 employers have switched to exclusive contracts with managed care insurers, and  			 compare the experiences of employees with severe impairments in such firms to  			 those of their counterparts in other firms. Employer personnel data and insurer  			 claims data would be needed to conduct such an analysis. Examination of claims  			 for Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and private disability insurance  			 (PDI) from the firms' employees would provide another, less direct way of  			 measuring the impact of the change on employment of workers with disabilities.  			 ASPE is currently sponsoring some research on the impact of managed care on  			 people with disabilities. Future ASPE-sponsored research should include  			 employment as one outcome in its managed care evaluations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>To what extent are community-based mental health services  			 available to support the employment of those with mental illnesses, and how  			 effective are they</i>? The Thresholds program in Chicago supports employment  			 of those with mental illnesses with ongoing services. We do not know the extent  			 to which states provide support for such services, the effectiveness of such  			 services, or the cost and revenue impacts.</p>
</li>
</ol><h4 align="CENTER">c. Personal Assistance Services and Assistive  		Technologies</h4>
<ol><li>
<p><i>How can PAS and AT be used to increase employment of persons with  			 disabilities</i>? Although some existing data could be exploited to examine  			 this issue there is a need for collection of new data. Studies of state, local,  			 insurer, and employer programs that provide support for PAS and/or AT should be  			 considered. Studies should not be limited to use of PAS and AT in the workplace  			 only because availability of PAS and AT away from the workplace may remove  			 barriers to employment. The extent to which PAS and AT may complement or  			 substitute for each other should also be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>To what extent would removing current restrictions on funding for  			 PAS and AT (e.g., means testing) and increasing overall funding levels increase  			 the employment of persons with disabilities and improve their well-being, and  			 how could scarce funds be more efficiently targeted to increase employment and  			 earnings of those with disabilities</i>? Current funding for PAS and ATs  			 imposes limits on the types of equipment or services covered, on the place of  			 use, and on the characteristics of the user. It would be very valuable to find  			 or create opportunities to evaluate the impact on employment of relaxing such  			 restrictions and to assess the associated costs and benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>How effective would greater outreach to those with  			 disabilities--regarding the availability of support for PAS, ATs. and various  			 other types of support--be in encouraging their employment and improving their  			 well-being, and how much would it cost</i>? There is some evidence that persons  			 with disabilities lack knowledge about ATs and the availability of financing  			 for PAS and ATs that would benefit them, including enabling them to enter the  			 labor force or increase their earnings. Evaluations of the effects of outreach  			 efforts intended to provide such knowledge are needed to determine whether this  			 is a cost-effective approach to increasing employment of persons with  			 disabilities, relative to other approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Who provides PAS to disabled workers in the workplace today</i>?  			 To what extent are they provided by coworkers who have other duties to perform,  			 on a formal or informal basis? Do firms or employee cooperatives hire  			 attendants to serve multiple workers? Case studies of PAS use in the workplace  			 could help answer these questions. How do assistants fit into the culture of  			 the workplace? How are they counted against "full-time equivalent"  			 quotas?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What would be the costs and benefits of a tax credit for PAS</i>?  			 The Clinton Administration proposed such a policy in its health care reform  			 proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Should the federal government pursue the development of standards  			 in telecommunications and computer technology that would aid in the development  			 of access technologies for workers with disabilities</i>? Appropriate standards  			 allow manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and computer technology to  			 design products to suit the special needs of workers with disabilities.  			 Building these accommodations into products during the design phase is often a  			 much less expensive way of providing access to persons with disabilities than  			 subsequently modifying existing products. While the potential gains of  			 appropriate standards are clear, it is critical that any standards adopted are  			 flexible and easily modified when technology changes and new products become  			 available. Rigid standards may have the unintended effect of stifling  			 innovation and creativity.</p>
</li>
</ol><h4 align="CENTER">d. Employment Strategies</h4>
<ol><li>
<p><i>How successful and cost-effective are "individualistic,  			 comprehensive" programs that help persons with disabilities obtain the goal of  			 employment</i>? The programs selected for the case studies (Chapter VI) all use  			 individualistic, comprehensive strategies to help persons with disabilities  			 obtain employment. While these programs show promise, more rigorous evaluations  			 are needed to address the following issues:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Are these programs cost-effective relative to other types of  				  programs, including smaller, less comprehensive ones?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are positive outcomes actually due to the  				  programs' interventions? Some of the evident success of the programs may be due  				  to the selection of clients who have a high probability of future employment  				  even without the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How important are individual program features, such as job  				  placement vs. job training, in determining outcomes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the availability of assistive technologies and personal  				  assistance services to clients critical to success for some groups? Do programs  				  take advantage of innovations in assistive technologies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do employment strategies and their success depend on the  				  type and severity of disability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How important is client age and prior work experience to program  				  success? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much do these programs cost and what are the economic  				  returns? From the perspective of the government, can some programs pay for  				  themselves through reductions in future transfer payments to clients and  				  increases in future tax revenues from clients? How does this vary with client  				  characteristics?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What role does access to health care and health insurance play  				  in the success of these programs?</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><i>What is the most efficient way to provide assistance that gives  			 those with disabilities maximum control over how the assistance is used to  			 support their employment (e.g., tax credits or vouchers), and how  			 cost-effective would such a system be in increasing employment and earnings  			 among persons with disabilities in comparison to programs that give the  			 consumer less control (e.g., case management or agency-directed allocations of  			 ATs. PAS, etc.)</i>? While credits and vouchers have great appeal because  			 recipients can use them in ways that are tailored to their particular needs, we  			 have not found empirical evidence on the impact of such funding or on the  			 extent to which such funding would in fact be used in an efficient manner.  			 Rigorous evaluation of demonstrations that use vouchers or credits, including  			 impact analysis and analysis of the extent to which such programs pay for  			 themselves, would be very desirable. Results should be compared to findings  			 from analyses of individualistic employment programs that provide comprehensive  			 services (see above) and of case management demonstrations such as SSA's  			 Project NetWork. ODALTCP might also benefit from reviewing the plans for the  			 Project NetWork evaluation and assessing whether additional evaluation might  			 provide useful policy information for ODALTCP programs that would otherwise be  			 lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>To what extent do programs under the Job Training and Partnership  			 Act (JTPA) provide assistance to persons with disabilities, to what extent do  			 JTPA policies favor or discriminate against persons with disabilities, and how  			 might JTPA become more cost-effective in providing assistance to persons with  			 disabilities</i>? We found that JTPA funds support many San Francisco  			 Vocational Services clients, and that JTPA is a source of client referrals.  			 While JTPA supports many employment programs targeted at those with  			 disabilities, current JTPA performance standards have incentives to "cream"  			 among the disabled population and may underserve them as a result (Barnow,  			 1994). It would be worthwhile to at least explore the role of JTPA in funding  			 employment programs for persons with disabilities further and, if feasible,  			 evaluate the impact of that funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>To what extent is the sensitivity of employment of workers with  			 disabilities to the business cycle influenced by current disability and  			 unemployment programs and how could these programs be redesigned to better meet  			 the temporary needs of this population</i>? Several studies show that  			 participation in Social Security's disability programs is sensitive to the  			 business cycle, and other studies show that workers with disabilities are often  			 both the "first-fired" in a recession and the "last-hired" in a recovery.  			 Better unemployment insurance (UI) benefits might reduce the impact of  			 recessions on disability program participation by helping those with  			 disabilities through difficult times. A number of demonstration projects have  			 been conducted with support from the Department of Labor during the past 15  			 years, with the objective of determining how changes in the UI benefit  			 structure affect return-to-work. To our knowledge nobody has examined the  			 impact of the demonstration benefits on people with disabilities. If data  			 collected would permit it, analysis of the impact of these demonstrations on  			 workers with disabilities would be worthwhile; if not, future demonstration  			 plans should consider the collection of appropriate data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What is the impact of economic restructuring on employment  			 opportunities for persons with disabilities, and what policies would assist  			 them in adapting to permanent changes in the nature of work</i>? Some studies  			 have documented changes in the nature of work, and there are reasons to believe  			 that these changes reduce employment opportunities for some persons with  			 disabilities, but improve prospects for others. More information is needed on  			 what differentiates the "winners" from the "losers" in order to develop  			 cost-effective policy responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>How important is the role of employers and private disability  			 insurers in return-to-work for newly disabled workers, and how could public  			 policy best encourage employer and insurer efforts in this area</i>? The  			 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) places substantial legal responsibility  			 on employers to employ workers with disabilities. There is a general belief  			 that efforts of employers to accommodate or otherwise assist employees with  			 disabilities are key to the latter's success in competitive employment. Private  			 disability insurers, who are interested in controlling their claims costs, may  			 also play a key role. Yet there Is little hard evidence on the impact that  			 employers and insurers can have on employment of workers with disabilities, or  			 on how public policy can encourage that role. Evaluation of employer/insurer  			 "disability management" programs and examination of how public policy can  			 create incentives for employers and insurers to promote employment of workers  			 with disabilities is needed. Research on small businesses that are exempt from  			 ADA accommodation requirements is also needed. Such businesses may serve as  			 useful control groups for studies of larger firms that are not exempt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>To what extent is the relatively low labor force participation of  			 persons with disabilities due to their low levels of education, rather than  			 their disabilities, and to what extent are low levels of education due to  			 educational barriers faced by persons with disabilities</i>? In many employment  			 studies "disability" may be serving as a proxy for education. It is important  			 to understand the many links between education, disability and work in order to  			 determine whether a particular intervention will be effective. Removing  			 barriers to education and training will be most effective in promoting work If  			 lack of education and training is the primary deterrent to work, not the  			 disability itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What more can be learned from the successes and failures of  			 policies and employment strategies that have been implemented in other  			 countries</i>? How important are rehabilitation programs? Benefit limitations  			 for younger workers? Incentives for employers?</p>
</li>
</ol><h4 align="CENTER">e. Other</h4>
<ol><li>
<p><i>What can be learned from existing longitudinal data and what  			 other opportunities are there to improve our understanding of the dynamics of  			 disability, employment, and welfare</i>? Data from simple cross-sections tell  			 us little about dynamic aspects of disability and employment that are critical  			 to the design of appropriate policies.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>To what extent do educational and other characteristics of  				  persons who have at any time experienced or been labeled as having had a  				  disability differ from the characteristics of those with disabilities who are  				  observed in a single cross-section? Characteristics may be quite different  				  because a relatively large share of those in a cross-section will have very  				  long term, or even lifetime, disabilities. Age at onset and duration of  				  disability are important aspects to consider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the characteristics of the disablement process, and how  				  do they vary? What are the critical determinants of whether an impairment or  				  health condition becomes a work disability? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What roles are played by family members, employers, government  				  programs, private insurers, and medical and rehabilitation  				  professionals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are persons with disabilities more responsive to  				  employment incentives and training immediately following disablement than years  				  later, when their skills may have deteriorated and when they have grown  				  accustomed to living on insurance or welfare benefits?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are AFDC families that have one or more children with  				  disabilities typically families that would be out of poverty if it were not for  				  their children's disabilities, or are they typically families whose low  				  education levels and skills contribute to both their poverty and their  				  children's disabilities? Is the extremely high rate of disability among older  				  AFDC mothers due to long-term dependence of a core group of women or because  				  the onset of disability at middle age is a frequent cause of AFDC participation  				  for older women?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Existing longitudinal surveys, such as the Panel Survey of Income  			 Dynamics (PSID), the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), the National  			 Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and High School and Beyond (HSAB) should be  			 exploited as much as possible to learn more about the work and welfare  			 transitions of persons with disabilities and changes in their economic well-  			 being over time. Analysis of foreign longitudinal data sets such as the 11-wave  			 German Socioeconomic Panel could also be fruitful. Opportunities to collect and  			 analyze other longitudinal data are also needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What analysis should be conducted using the 1994-96 disability  			 Supplement to the NHIS when the data become available</i>? These data will  			 offer many opportunities to conduct analyses that have not been possible in the  			 past, as well as to replicate earlier research. For instance, it will be  			 possible to examine how work patterns vary by type of disability at a level of  			 detail that has not been possible previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>What more can be learned from survey data that are already  			 available, or soon to be available, about the employment of persons with  			 disabilities or of parents of children with disabilities</i>? There are several  			 existing sources of data that may be further analyzed to loam more about the  			 labor force participation of persons with disabilities: the 1990 SIPP has  			 sufficient information on disability to explore employment differences among  			 persons with different types of impairments, and to examine the relationship  			 between children with disabilities and their parents' employment; and the  			 assistive devices supplement to the 1990 NHIS (NHIS-AD) could be used for  			 analyzing the importance of assistive technology in the employment of persons  			 with disabilities, although the number of persons with disabilities in the  			 sample is relatively small.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>We conclude with two general observations. First, in the past many  		inexpensive opportunities to study the employment of persons with disabilities  		have been missed because of failure to include appropriate measures of  		disability or employment in databases that were being constructed for other  		purposes. We strongly recommend that ODALTCP consider employment for those with  		disabilities as an issue in any evaluation of a demonstration or program that  		it supports, if at all relevant. We further recommend that ODALTCP do whatever  		it can to support similar efforts in other government departments and  		agencies.</p>
<p>Second, there is an evident need for integration of government policies  		and programs for persons with disabilities. At the federal level, major  		programs of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of  		Education, the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Labor all  		provide support of some sort. Other federal agencies, state and local  		governments also provide support in a variety of ways. Research is needed on  		how programs and services could be integrated in ways that would promote  		employment, improve the lives of persons with disabilities, and reduce waste of  		government resources.</p>
