<h2>I. Why Has This Study Been Undertaken? </h2>
<p>This study was initiated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to identify best practices for implementing  		consumer-directed personal assistance (CD-PAS) programs through the use of  		various intermediary service organization (ISO) models. Twenty-three state and  		Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs that used ISOs in eleven states were examined  		in the study. </p>
<p>The term <i>personal assistance services</i> (PAS) refers to a range of  		human and mechanical assistance provided to persons with disabilities of any  		age who require help with routine activities of daily living (ADLs) and health  		maintenance activities. These services, when provided in non-institutional  		settings, are also frequently referred to as "home and community-based  		long-term care." PAS is the term preferred by persons with disabilities as well  		as by professionals in the disability and aging fields who advocate  		consumer-directed PAS models as a means of maximizing the independence and  		autonomy of persons who need functional assistance from others. Although PAS is  		broadly defined as including assistive technologies, home modifications,  		psychosocial rehabilitation, and a host of other specialized products and  		services oriented to persons with disabilities and chronic conditions, the core  		service is personal assistance. PAS are typically provided by an unskilled  		person who is variously referred to as a <i>personal care assistant (PCA),  		attendant</i> or <i>aide</i> (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996). </p>
<p><i>Consumer-directed</i> modes of financing and delivering PAS permit  		the consumer-as opposed to medical or social work professionals--comparatively  		greater choice and control over all aspects of service provision including: (1)  		recruiting, hiring, and training attendants, (2) defining attendants' duties  		and work schedules (3) supervising attendants regarding how specific tasks are  		to be performed, (4) managing the payroll functions, including paying  		attendants, and (5) disciplining and discharging attendants. CD-PAS programs  		may be ranked on a continuum as more or less <i>consumer-directed</i> to the  		extent that the programs foster greater choice and control with regard to  		several of the above mentioned tasks (Doty, Kasper and Litvak, 1996).  		Consumer-direction is maximized when the consumer purchases his or her PAS with  		personal resources (unless he or she relinquishes the employer tasks to a  		provider agency). However, when a third party payor is involved in financing  		PAS (e.g., private insurance or publicly-funded programs such as Medicaid),  		certain limitations may be placed on the consumer's ability to exercise choice  		and control over his or her PAS. </p>
<p>Advocates of CD-PAS programs argue that persons with disabilities and  		chronic conditions should be afforded as much independence and autonomy as  		possible in decisions regarding the types, amounts, and sources of PAS they can  		access, especially related to PCA services. But, with choice and control come  		responsibility and risk for the consumer, as the attendant may be considered  		the consumer's employee rather than an independent contractor under the IRS and  		DoL definitions of <i>domestic servants</i> (Flanagan, 1994; Gibson, 1992;  		O.Neil and Nelsestuen, 1993; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995; Szabo, 1993). Moreover,  		persons with disabilities and chronic conditions vary greatly in their ability  		and desire to manage their PAS. </p>
<p>A number of states have implemented state and Medicaid-funded CD-PAS  		programs. The use of public funds raises significant questions related to  		program and fiscal accountability, regulatory compliance and liability for  		negligence affecting consumers or attendants which must be addressed. Because  		of these issues, states have begun to develop a variety of <i>intermediary  		service organization (ISO)</i> models to facilitate the use of CD-PAS programs  		by persons with disabilities and chronic conditions of all ages and to assist  		government policymakers in achieving an appropriate balance among the competing  		goals of: providing appropriate PAS that affords consumers' choice and control,  		while assuring program and fiscal accountability, regulatory compliance,  		protection from liability, service quality and consumer health and safety. </p>
<p>An intermediary service organization (ISO) is an entity that acts as an  		interagent between a CD-PAS program and eligible consumers for purposes of  		disbursing public funds and assisting consumers in performing tasks associated  		with the employment of PAS attendants. From the perspective of CD-PAS program,  		the core tasks of an ISO are: (1) to directly ensure compliance with legal  		requirements related to employment of PAS attendants and/or (2) to offer  		supportive services to enable consumer to perform the required employer tasks  		themselves. </p>
<p>When the ISO performs these tasks directly, it may, for example,  		calculate Social Security, Medicare (FICA), and federal and state unemployment  		tax (FUTA/SUTA) and make all appropriate tax filings with regard to the  		attendant. It may also broker and administer attendants' fringe benefits, if  		available. On the other hand, an intermediary may simply assist an eligible  		consumer by offering training in when and how to manage the employment tax and  		payroll responsibilities. In such cases, the ISO may monitor the consumer's  		performance of these tasks to ensure that the consumer is complying with all  		applicable federal and state requirements associated with employing household  		help such as a PAS attendant. </p>
<p>ISOs may provide administrative/fiscal and supportive services to  		eligible consumers. Administrative/fiscal services can include: disbursing  		public funds, withholding and filing employment taxes, brokering benefits,  		preparing and disbursing payroll checks and processing employment-related  		documents including the INS Form I-9, the IRS Form W-2, and timesheets.  		Supportive services can include: training related to hiring, firing and  		supervising attendants, managing employment taxes and payroll, assisting  		consumers in obtaining temporary or emergency "back-up" services, providing  		peer counseling, conducting and/or assisting consumers with checking attendant  		references and/or performing criminal background checks, client assessments,  		and providing case management. </p>
<p>There is no single set of services that an ISO must provide. Rather, the  		state CDPAS program agency should design ISOs that can meet the specific  		federal and state regulatory requirements and the needs of the service  		population(s). For example, one ISO may focus exclusively on performing  		administrative/fiscal tasks (e.g., payroll) on behalf of the consumer, whereas  		another ISO may focus on supportive services, such as training and assistance  		to enable consumers to perform the employer tasks themselves. </p>
<p>The ISO models examined in this study are the: Fiscal Conduit ISO, IRS  		Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, Vendor Fiscal ISO, Supportive ISO, Agency with  		Choice ISO, and the Spectrum ISO. </p>
<p>Prior to this study, little was known of the ISO models currently being  		used by states' CD-PAS programs, how well they meet the objectives of the  		various stakeholders (e.g., CD-PAS program administrators, the IRS and the U.S.  		Department of Labor, disability advocates, states' nurse licensing boards, and  		consumers and their attendants) and whether ISOs actually facilitate the use of  		CD-PAS and enhance consumers' choice and control. However, two earlier studies  		(Flanagan, 1994; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995) recommended that states use ISOs to  		manage the tax and labor law issues related to CD-PAS, and that states make  		available supportive services to consumers. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>II. What Is The Purpose Of This Report? </h2>
<p>This final report provides practical advice to state program  		administrators regarding the implementation of CD-PAS programs and ISOs. In  		particular, <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#tax">Chapter III</a>,  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#contract">Chapter V</a>, and <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#various">Chapter VI</a>, taken together, constitute an informal  		manual of advice from which state program administrators can design optimal  		CD-PAS programs using ISOs which are based on sound, regulatory principles and  		well-drafted contracts. Overall, this final report assists state program  		administrators in designing CD-PAS programs with ISOs that:</p>
<ul><li>comply with applicable federal tax and labor laws;</li>
<li>make available supportive services that some consumers may want or  		  need; and</li>
<li>allow for the application and enforcement of any limitation or  		  restrictions on consumer direction that may be required by state laws and  		  regulations. </li>
</ul><p>It should be noted that due to the significant variation in state tax,  		labor, worker's compensation and disability insurance law, the focus of this  		study was on federal Department of Labor (DoL) and Internal Revenue Service  		(IRS) laws and their effect on CD-PAS programs and ISOs. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>III. How Was The Study Conducted? </h2>
<p>Twenty three CD-PAS programs in eleven states that used six different  		models of intermediary service organizations (ISOs) were selected based on a  		sampling framework that included seven categories. The seven sampling  		categories were derived from the literature, information gathered from a brief  		phone survey of state CD-PAS program administrators, and comment received from  		the study's technical advisory panel (TAP). The eleven states selected for this  		study were: Georgia, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New  		York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington State. Semistructured interview  		guides were developed and used to interview the key stakeholder groups in each  		state. </p>
<p>Site visits and telephone interviews were conducted in the eleven study  		states between December 1, 1995 through August 30, 1996. One hundred  		fifty-eight interviews were conducted with one hundred eighty-nine respondents  		in the eleven states. Key stakeholders interviewed included: state CD-PAS  		program administrators, ISO administrators, executive directors of the states'  		board of nurses and home health agencies, advocates for the disabled and  		elderly, consumers and their attendants. Of the one hundred eighty-nine  		respondents interviewed, forty-one were consumers and twenty-two were  		attendants. </p>
<p>Meetings and briefings were held with key central office staff at the  		Internal Revenue Service and Department of Labor to discuss IRS and DoL rules  		and regulations pertinent to the study. </p>
<p>This final report addresses six policy relevant questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What are the various models of ISOs and how do they  			 operate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the federal laws and regulations issues that affect the  			 development and operation of ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the incentives and barriers that affect the development and  			 operation of CD-PAS program with ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do states' nurse practice acts affect the development and  			 operation of CD-PAS programs with or without ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do contracts facilitate the operation of CD-PAS programs that  			 use ISOs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How well do the various ISO models facilitate the use of CD-PAS  			 programs for state program administrators and consumers with disabilities and  			 chronic conditions?</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h2>V. Tax, Labor, Workers's Compensation And Disability Insurance, And  		Immigration Law Issues Related to CD-PAS Programs </h2>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#tax">Chapter Three</a> presents an overview of the  		important federal tax and labor, worker's compensation, disability insurance  		and immigration laws that are applicable to CD-PAS programs and sets forth  		alternative strategies for achieving compliance with such laws and regulations  		while preserving consumer choice and control. Each issue discussed is followed  		by best practice recommendations in cases where questions have arisen. </p>
<p>States designing these programs for consumers at all levels of desire  		and ability to manage their own affairs must find ways of ensuring that  		participants in the program comply with all applicable laws and regulations,  		state and federal. Program administrators must identify those consumers who are  		able to manage these responsibilities effectively and design program options  		consistent with these high levels of ability. At the same time, administrators  		must recognize that there may be other consumers who have neither the desire or  		the ability (in person or through a surrogate) to manage all of the fiscal and  		administrative tasks inherent in the modern employment relationship. These  		consumers may still wish to manage all other aspects of the employment  		relationship while delegating certain employment-related tasks to an  		intermediary service organization (ISO), which performs these services as the  		agent of the consumer. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>A. Tax Rules Affecting CD-PAS Programs </b></h3>
<p>Most of the tax issues affecting CD-PAS programs arise from federal  		income tax, social security and unemployment tax laws. Attendants appear to be  		employees of the consumer in most CD-PAS arrangements (except where an agency  		is the legal employer of record, as in the case of "Agency with Choice" ISOs).  		The level of control and supervision exercised by most consumers makes it  		difficult, if not impossible, to characterize the attendant as an independent  		contractor. </p>
<p>Whether the attendant is an independent contractor (unlikely) or an  		employee, income tax responsibility generally rests with the employee. The  		consumer-employer is not obliged to withhold income tax for a household  		employee (unless requested to do so), but the consumer must provide a statement  		of wages earned (IRS Form W-2) and must distribute notices and pay advance  		payments of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) to eligible employees. </p>
<p>With regard to employment tax issues, recent modifications to the Social  		Security Act to raise eligibility thresholds for covered workers and simplify  		filing requirements for householders have raised questions for consumers who  		receive assistance from ISOs. These ISOs (state and private vendors) have  		reported employment taxes on a quarterly basis and have been governed by  		depositing rules applicable to most other employers. Should such organizations  		alter their filing practices and procedures? <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#tax">Chapter  		Three</a> offers best practice suggestions for resolving issues arising from  		the application of the new amendments to filing procedures previously adhered  		to by public and private ISOs acting as agents for consumer-employers in CD-PAS  		programs. Specifically, <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#tax">Chapter Three</a> recommends  		that ISOs, acting on behalf of CD-PAS consumers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>File quarterly reports of Social Security and Medicare (FICA)  			 withholding from employee wages using federal Form 941 as advised in IRS Notice  			 95-18, adhering to the appropriate deposit rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply for a separate federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) as  			 directed by IRS Notice 95-18 for use solely in preparing tax filings as agent  			 for CD-PAS consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop strategies to deal with refunds which must be made to any  			 attendant whose earnings do not exceed $1,000 annually from an individual  			 consumer-employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, if the ISO elects to prepare an IRS Schedule H on  			 behalf of a CD-PAS consumer for his or her attendant(s) and not withhold and  			 deposit the employment taxes, the ISO should remind the consumer periodically  			 of the need to set aside monies to satisfy any employment tax liability arising  			 from the employment relationship. In cases where the ISO withholds the  			 necessary employment taxes, it must make sure to follow the appropriate IRS  			 deposit rules and manage any accrued interest accrued appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issue IRS Form W-2 on behalf of the consumer to each attendant  			 receiving wages for services performed by that consumer. List only the wages  			 attributable to that consumer on the IRS Form W-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include in the total wage for each employee any co-payments made by  			 the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confer frequently with IRS regional and central office personnel on  			 any questions concerning appropriate filing methods, especially for any  			 practice which departs from the methods authorized by IRS Notice  			 95-18.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER"><b>B. Department of Labor (DoL) Rules Affecting CD-PAS  		Programs </b></h3>
<p>Previous studies of labor laws affecting CD-PAS programs have identified  		a number of important requirements for program administrators to consider and  		incorporate in the design and rules pertaining to their state and/or  		Medicaid-funded CD-PAS programs (Flanagan, 1994; Sabatino and Litvak, 1995).  		This study's analysis is based on the findings and recommendations contained in  		these studies, updated to include recent communications from tax and labor  		authorities as well as reports from the fields as to current policies and  		practices of CD-PAS programs that use ISOs. </p>
<p>Personal care attendants (PCAs) are classified as domestic servants  		under the Department of Labor's (DoL) Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#tax">Chapter Three</a> discusses the federal minimum wage  		and overtime rules outlined in FLSA as they pertain to domestic servants, two  		exemptions to these rules as they pertain to <i>companions</i> and  		<i>live-in</i> help, the payment of <i>night attendants</i> and OSHA related  		issues. </p>
<p>State CD-PAS program, ISO administrators, and CD-PAS consumers,  		(particularly those who manage all of the employer-related tasks for their  		attendants), must be aware of the provisions of the federal Department of  		Labor's <i>Fair Labor Standards Act</i> (FLSA) regarding domestic service  		employees (including PAS attendants), including the exemptions for  		<i>companion</i> and <i>live-in</i> staff and the provision for <i>night  		attendants</i>. Moreover, they must be aware of any additional state DoL rules  		that differ from the federal rules in order to be in full compliance with state  		and federal DoL rules related to FLSA. CD-PAS and ISO administrators should  		also assess the feasibility of using the <i>companion</i> and <i>live-in</i>  		exemptions when designing their CD-PAS programs in order to take advantage of  		any cost efficiencies related to exemptions for these worker categories. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>C. State Worker's Compensation and Disability  		Insurance Laws and Their Effect on CD-PAS Programs </b></h3>
<p>Worker's compensation insurance laws are state laws that establish basic  		<i>quid pro quo</i> programs. Under worker's compensation insurance laws, an  		employee agrees to relinquish his or her right to sue his or her employer for  		damages arising from injuries on the job in return for receiving prompt payment  		of benefits related to medical care and loss of income due to an injury on the  		job. Each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the  		Virgin Islands has a worker's compensation program. However, some states allow  		small employers an exemption from otherwise applicable worker's compensation  		law. For example, in Missouri, employers need not pay worker's compensation  		insurance benefits if they have fewer than four employees, whereas in New  		Jersey, an employer of even a single employee must provide worker's  		compensation insurance benefits. </p>
<p>The number of worker's compensation insurance claims reported by CD-PAS  		program and ISO administrators in this study was extremely low. For example,  		only one worker's compensation case was reported in the three states. CD-PAS  		programs reviewed that used an IRS/EA Fiscal ISO model and one from the nine  		programs reviewed that used an Agency with Choice ISO model. One reason given  		was that the majority of attendants had not experienced a work-related injury.  		Another reason given was that many PCAs did not have the knowledge or the  		financial resources to file a claim. A third reason given was that the  		consumer's income and assets were very low, making any efforts to file a claim  		against the consumer not worthwhile. However, when an Agency with Choice ISO  		was the employer of record of the PCA, even though few claims were filed, there  		was considerable apprehension about the potential cost implications of such  		claims. </p>
<p>Five states -- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island  		-- and Puerto Rico have statutes establishing state disability insurance  		programs. Under such laws, employees and, in most cases, employers must pay a  		special tax to fund the program or pay for private insurance coverage that  		meets state requirements (Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>Generally, disability insurance programs are coordinated with a state's  		worker's compensation and/or unemployment insurance programs, so in most cases,  		both taxes or premiums are paid at the same time and the particular state  		statute defines "employer" and "employee." In general, employment paying less  		than $1000 in wages in a calendar quarter is exempt from providing disability  		and/or worker's compensation insurance, although some state's have lower  		dollar-amount thresholds. For example, in New York, employers of domestic  		workers in a private home need not pay temporary disability benefits tax unless  		they have employed one or more workers for forty hours per week for at least  		four weeks, and at least thirty days in the calendar year. </p>
<p>CD-PAS program and ISO administrators and consumers, (particularly those  		who manage all of the employer-related tasks related to their attendants), must  		be aware of any state statutes for worker's compensation and disability  		insurance and the scope of these statutes in order to make sure the CD-PAS  		program and its participants are in full compliance with state law. Moreover,  		where the laws do not apply, CD-PAS program administrators may wish to consider  		the positive implications of offering such benefits, such as allowing consumers  		to effectively recruit quality attendants and to avoid any cases where even an  		inappropriate claim by an attendant may result in the state being considered  		the attendant's employer by an administrative law judge or even a court of law.  		</p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>D. Verifying Citizen or Legal Alien Status </b></h3>
<p>Employers, including employers of domestic workers (e.g., personal care  		attendants), must verify and maintain records (e.g., completed INS Form I-9)  		showing that each employee hired after November 7, 1986, is a U.S. citizen, a  		national of the U.S., or a legal alien who is authorized to work in the U.S.  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>Failure of an employer to comply with the verification and record  		keeping requirements can result in fines ranging from $100 to $1000 for each  		violation. Moreover, an employer who hires a person known to be an unauthorized  		alien can be punished by a fine of $250 to $2,000 for the first offense, with  		higher fines applicable to subsequent offenses, and criminal penalties if  		convicted of a "pattern or practice" of knowingly hiring illegal aliens  		(Sabatino and Litvak, 1995). </p>
<p>All of the CD-PAS programs studied were in full compliance with the  		Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and the regulations regarding the  		employment verification process. State designing and implementing CD-PAS  		program, ISO administrators and consumers (particularly those that manage all  		the employer-related tasks for their attendants) should obtain and become  		familiar with a copy of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Public  		Law 99-603, 8 USC Section 1324 (1994). Moreover, whoever is responsible for the  		verification process (e.g., state IRS Employer Agent ISO, Vendor Fiscal ISO,  		Agency with Choice ISO or Spectrum ISO or consumer) should be able to perform  		all the necessary verification tasks and have a place to store the related  		documentation safely for the required amount of time. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>VI. The Effect of State Nurse Practice Acts on the Development of  		CD-PAS Programs </h2>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#effect">Chapter Four</a> presents an analysis of how  		state nurse licensing laws (i.e., state nurse practice acts) affect the design  		and implementation of CD-PAS programs. It also describes how state nurse  		licensing laws and CD-PAS program regulations overlap and discusses areas of  		actual and potential conflict. Two methods cited for resolving conflicts (i.e.  		exemption and delegation) are described, compared and evaluated. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>A. Potential Conflicts Between State Licensing Laws  		and CD-PAS Program Regulations </b></h3>
<p>State laws regulating the profession of nursing were not written with  		today's CDPAS employment relationships in mind. However, they may be construed  		to apply to tasks performed by unlicensed personnel such as personal care  		attendants (PCAs). Many CDPAS programs contain extensive lists of duties which  		may be performed by PCAs. Some of these duties, particularly those which relate  		to the maintenance of consumers. health and well being, may be seen as falling  		within the definitions of .nursing. or .nursing practice. contained in all  		state nurse practice acts. The first part of <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#effect">Chapter  		Four</a> describes areas of potential conflict between these two areas of state  		law </p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>B. Exemption and Delegation: Two Ways of Reconciling  		State Nurse Practice Acts with CD-PAS Program Regulations </b></h3>
<p>CD-PAS program administrators may seek to resolve actual or potential  		conflicts in at least two basic ways if unable to construe the licensing laws  		to harmonize with CD-PAS program regulations: (1) Seek a specific  		<i>exemption</i> to the application of nurse practice acts for CD-PAS programs  		within a state; or (2) work with the State Board of Nurses representatives,  		consumer advocates and other interested parties to develop workable delegation  		protocols allowing health maintenance tasks that fall within the statute's  		definition of "nursing" or "nursing practice" to be performed by unlicensed  		personnel through <i>delegation</i>. <i>Delegation</i> is the process whereby  		licensed nursing professionals delegate their authority to perform specific  		tasks to other personnel serving an individual. If the CD-PAS program is  		<i>exempt</i> from the nurse practice limits on allowable tasks, PCAs may  		perform all health maintenance and health related tasks without formal  		authorization by a licensed nursing professional. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>C. Exemption and Delegation Compared </b></h3>
<p>A specific <i>exemption</i> from professional nurse licensing laws  		(i.e., nurse practice acts) is easy to administer and raises the fewest  		implementation issues. However, it may not be either feasible or desirable  		(from an equitable point of view) to obtain a specific <i>exemption</i> for  		CD-PAS attendants if other unlicensed personnel are still subject to the act.  		If no exemption is available through interpretation or by legislative  		amendment, <i>delegation</i> can work for those few tasks that are clearly  		within the exclusive province of licensed nurse professionals. CD-PAS program  		administrators should work closely with all affected parties to ensure that  		<i>delegation</i> protocols affecting unlicensed personnel within a state are  		designed to facilitate CD-PAS and to meet the goals of consumer-direction and  		the Independent Living philosophy. </p>

<h2>VII. Effective Use of Contracts to Facilitate the Operation of CD-PAS  		Programs </h2>
<p>Well designed CD-PAS programs emphasize both the independence desired by  		the consumer as well as the responsibilities that go with the increase in  		independence and authority. <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#contract">Chapter Five</a>  		examines CD-PAS programs using ISOs, seeking to discover, among other things,  		whether, and how, contracts apportioning the rights and duties of the ISO,  		consumer and attendants facilitate these multi-party relationships. This study  		found considerable variation in the scope and subject matter of the contracts  		used in the twenty-three CD-PAS programs reviewed. However, it did appear that  		the very process of expressing rights, duties, responsibilities and  		expectations on paper was generally beneficial in helping the parties achieve  		the balance between consumer-direction and responsibility that worked best for  		all. </p>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#contract">Chapter Five</a> concluded that contracts  		that clearly spell out the duties, rights, responsibilities and expectations of  		the parties to these new and evolving relationships facilitate the efficient  		operation of CD-PAS programs that use ISOs. Although it takes time to draft a  		good contract, this time well spent can do much to anticipate and avoid future  		problems. No contract model fits all of the CD-PAS program relationships.  		However, a number of models can be developed by states to address the various  		relationships. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>VIII. How Well Do Various ISO Models Assist State Program  		Administrators in Designing and Implementing CD-PAS Programs and Consumers in  		Using CD-PAS? </h2>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#various">Chapter Six</a> discusses the utility of  		employing various models of intermediary service organizations (ISOs) to  		improve the delivery of CD-PAS services to persons of all ages with  		disabilities and chronic conditions. However, no ISO model is optimal for every  		CDPAS consumer. This is because, as in the general population, the  		characteristics of persons with disabilities vary from person to person. The  		two principal characteristics CD-PAS administrators must focus on when  		designing CD-PAS programs are the (1) consumer's <i>desire</i> and (2)  		<i>ability</i> to perform the wide range of employer-related tasks associated  		with CD-PAS. This study examined the effectiveness of six ISO models in  		balancing individual consumers. desire and ability to perform the CD-PAS  		employer-related tasks independently with the states. desire to provide  		appropriate PAS to beneficiaries while ensuring regulatory compliance, program  		accountability, quality PAS and consumer health and safety. </p>
<p>Each ISO model was evaluated in terms of its performance related to  		specific evaluation criteria. These were access, program and cost efficiency,  		compliance/accountability, degree of consumer-direction afforded to consumers  		and level of administrative responsibility for the consumer. </p>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdpas.htm#various">Chapter Six</a> describes the performance of  		each of the ISO models examined based on the study's six evaluation criteria  		(i.e., consumer access to CD-PAS, program efficiency, cost efficiency,  		regulatory compliance and program and fiscal accountability, level of  		consumer-direction afforded to consumers and level of consumer responsibility).  		It also includes conclusions and recommendations for optimal design and  		implementation strategies for CD-PAS program administrators. The following are  		the conclusions and recommendations made for each ISO model and some that cut  		across ISO models. </p>
<h3 align="CENTER"><b>A. Fiscal Conduit ISO </b></h3>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>Fiscal Conduit ISOs offer consumers the highest level of  		consumer-direction and control. However, this ISO model tends to limit access  		to CD-PAS to consumers who are self-directing and who exhibit a high level of  		desire and ability to perform the employer-related responsibilities. The  		availability of effective consumer-employer skills training for consumers and  		their surrogates, when applicable, will increase consumer access to a certain  		extent. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>CD-PAS programs that use Fiscal Conduit ISOs can significantly limit the  		state's administrative efforts related to operating the program. Moreover, if a  		state negotiates the Fiscal Conduit ISO's contract and fees effectively, this  		model can be a very cost effective one for a state. </p>
<p>Regulatory compliance can vary significantly with this ISO model since  		the consumer, as the employer of record, is responsible for complying with all  		employer mandates. Program and fiscal accountability can also be variable since  		the state has the least amount of control over the administration of the CD-PAS  		program under this ISO model. </p>

</tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Fiscal Conduit ISOs work "best"  			 when (1) participating consumers have a high level of desire and ability, (2)  			 consumer-employer training is made available to consumers, and (3) when there  			 are strong oversight policies and procedures in place to monitor consumer  			 compliance with employer mandates and program regulations, and to assure that  			 Fiscal Conduit ISOs remain faithful to consumer-directed principles and the  			 Independent Living philosophy.</font></td>
</tr></table><h2 align="CENTER"><b>B. IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO </b></h2>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>The IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO offers consumers a high level of  		consumer-direction and control and greater access to the CD-PAS program than is  		afforded by the Fiscal Conduit ISO. Even though the consumer is the legal  		employer of record of his or her attendant(s), this ISO model reduces the  		consumer's employer-related responsibilities by managing the payroll function  		(managing employment taxes, benefits where appropriate, and preparing and  		disbursing payroll checks) for the consumer. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Under the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO model, the state has a  		significant amount of control over the administration of the program. However,  		this model may not lead to significant program efficiencies since the state may  		have to establish dual financial and accounting systems in order to manage the  		fiscal agent functions effectively (e.g., one system for the CD-PAS attendants  		and one for the general state employee population). This model may not be the  		most cost efficient ISO model for states since they may have difficulties  		achieving cost efficiencies using existing state personnel and systems. </p>
<p>The IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO model affords states a high level of  		compliance with employer mandates, a high level of program and fiscal  		accountability (due to the fact that the state itself is performing the payroll  		function for consumers) and allows states to retain significant control over  		the operation of the CD-PAS program. However, attendants often erroneously  		consider the state to be their employer of record under this model. This  		confusion can result in an additional administrative burden for the CD-PAS  		program agency. </p>
<table width="75%" bgcolor="#FFCC33" frame="BORDER" align="center" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1"><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISOs</b></font></td>

If a  			 state's current systems can not accommodate the new and required functions, a  			 state needs to assess the financial and operational feasibility of developing  			 the additional capabilities. Finally, if the systems modifications are not  			 operationally and/or financially feasible, then the state should consider  			 implementing a Vendor Fiscal ISO model.</font></td>
</tr></table><h3 align="CENTER"><b>C. Vendor Fiscal ISO </b></h3>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>Like the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, the Vendor Fiscal ISO offers  		consumers a high level of consumer-direction and control and allows greater  		access to the CD-PAS program than afforded by the Fiscal Conduit ISO. Although  		the consumer is the employer of record for his or her attendant, under this ISO  		model, a private Vendor Fiscal ISO reduces the consumer's employer-related  		responsibilities by managing the payroll function (managing employment taxes,  		benefits where appropriate, and preparing and disbursing payroll checks) for  		the consumer. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Unlike the IRS Employer Agent Fiscal ISO, the Vendor Fiscal ISO can  		offer states a reasonable level of program and cost efficiencies related to the  		administration of the program, particularly if the state effectively negotiates  		the state's Vendor Fiscal Agent ISO contract and the fees to the ISO. Since the  		state is using a vendor to perform fiscal and administrative functions on  		behalf of consumers and the state, it should develop explicit performance  		standards in the vendor contract so it can effectively monitor each vendor's  		ability to fulfill their responsibilities and their commitment to  		consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
<p>As with the IRS Employer Agent ISO, the Vendor Fiscal ISO model can  		achieve a high level of compliance with IRS and DoL laws since the vendor is  		performing the payroll function for consumers. Moreover, this model can also  		achieve a high level of program and fiscal accountability if the state drafts  		and implements effective vendor performance standards in Vendor Fiscal ISOs'  		contracts. </p>
<table width="75%" bgcolor="#FFCC33" frame="BORDER" align="center" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1"><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Vendor Fiscal ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">This study concludes that the  			 Vendor Fiscal ISOs offer states many advantages in terms of administrative and  			 cost efficiencies while reflecting a high level of consumer-direction for  			 consumers.

</tr></table><h3 align="CENTER"><b>D. Agency with Choice ISO </b></h3>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>In this model, the ISO is the legal employer of record and the consumer  		is considered the <i>managing employer</i>. Agency with Choice ISOs can offer  		consumers varying levels of consumer-direction depending on the desires and  		abilities of the consumer and the philosophy of a particular ISO. This ISO  		model can significantly reduce the level of consumer responsibility depending  		on what employer-related tasks it performs for consumers other than the payroll  		function. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>The Agency with Choice ISO can provide a high level of program  		efficiency since it manages a significant portion of the administrative work  		associated with CD-PAS programs. This ISO model can be cost efficient if the  		state CD-PAS program agency effectively negotiates its contract and fees with  		the ISO. </p>
<table width="75%" bgcolor="#FFCC33" frame="BORDER" align="center" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1"><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Agency with Choice ISOs</b></font></td>

Proper rate negotiation by the  			 state can result in this model being quite cost effective. Moreover, if the  			 proper consumer-directed philosophy is followed in agency practices, this ISO  			 model can potentially serve consumers with a broad range of ages and  			 disabilities. 
<p>This study recommends that states using the Agency with  			 Choice ISO model in the design of their CD-PAS program offer consumers varying  			 levels of consumer-direction depending on the needs and desires of the consumer  			 population. Moreover, states should consider allowing consumers to use Agency  			 with Choice ISO in order to obtain relief attendant services. Finally, this  			 study recommends that state CD-PAS programs that use Agency with Choice ISOs  			 develop performance standards that effectively monitor an ISO's and its  			 subcontractors' commitment to and application of consumer-direction  			 principles.</p></font></td>
</tr></table><h3 align="CENTER"><b>E. Supportive ISO </b></h3>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>Supportive intermediary services provided by either a stand-alone ISO or  		incorporated in one of the other ISO models, can enhance the level of access  		and consumer-direction afforded to consumers. These services can also assist  		consumers with the employer responsibilities associated with CD-PAS and in some  		cases (i.e., by maintaining an attendant registry), actually reduce such  		responsibilities for consumers. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Depending on how these services are administered, bundled and  		reimbursed, supportive services can be more or less efficient from a program  		and a cost perspective. They do enhance consumer compliance with regulatory  		mandates and can indirectly enhance CD-PAS program and fiscal accountability by  		developing more well informed consumers. </p>
<table width="75%" bgcolor="#FFCC33" frame="BORDER" align="center" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1"><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Supportive ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1">Supportive services, whether  			 offered by a "stand-alone" support agency or as part of an ISO's service  			 package, are highly effective in enhancing consumers' access to and success  			 with CD-PAS programs.

<p>This study recommends  			 that supportive intermediary services either assist the CDPAS consumer with  			 conducting criminal background checks on potential attendants or directly  			 conduct them for consumers.

</tr></table><h3 align="CENTER"><b>F. Spectrum ISO </b></h3>
<p><i><b>1. Access, Level of Consumer-Direction and Responsibility  		</b></i></p>
<p>The Spectrum ISO model maximizes access and consumer-direction for  		consumers participating in a CD-PAS program while allowing consumers to assume  		the level of employer responsibility they feel comfortable with. Consumers may  		or may not be the employer of record of their attendant depending on the  		intermediary service option(s) selected by the consumer. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Program and Cost Efficiency, Compliance and Accountability  		</b></i></p>
<p>Well designed Spectrum ISOs can offer states program and cost  		efficiencies by developing a seamless CD-PAS service delivery system. This ISO  		model can also achieve a high level of regulatory compliance and program and  		fiscal accountability while allowing the consumer to select from a range of  		intermediary service options. The primary reason for this is because the  		Spectrum ISO has the ability to transfer unsuccessful consumers into an ISO  		option that reduces their employer responsibility (i.e., can move a client who  		is unable to comply with the employer responsibilities from the "cash" option  		to one where the ISO manages the payroll function for the consumer). This model  		may also be effective in assisting consumers to obtain relief attendants on  		weekends, holidays and when their attendants are absent for any reason. </p>
<table width="75%" bgcolor="#FFCC33" frame="BORDER" align="center" cellspacing="0" border="1"><tr><td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1"><b>Conclusions and  			 Recommendations Regarding Spectrum ISOs</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFCC99"><font size="-1"> Use of the "Spectrum" ISO model  			 permits a state to offer consumers a wide range of intermediary service options  			 through a single umbrella organization.

</tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFCC99">
<p> There are a number of conclusions and recommendation that are  				applicable to all ISO models. These include the following. </p>
<ol><li>
<p>The most successful State-ISO contract relationships are  					 forged when the state has a clear understanding of the services it wishes to  					 purchase from an ISO. </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop  					 contracts with ISOs that clearly state an ISO.s role, responsibilities and  					 services. These contracts should include performance standards that can be used  					 to assess an ISO's activities and its commitment to consumer-directed  					 principles and the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers's back-up plans for relief attendants frequently  					 fail, causing consumers to have a difficult time finding relief attendants over  					 weekends, holidays and when the primary attendant is absent for any reason.  					 </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop a  					 mechanism that facilitates consumers access to relief attendants, possibly  					 through an arrangement with a Agency with Choice ISO or a Spectrum ISO that  					 offers an agency-based PAS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers are hesitant to initiate criminal background checks  					 on prospective attendants because they do not know how to conduct them and they  					 feel these checks compromise the consumer-attendant relationship. </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should develop a  					 standard user friendly system implemented by a program or an ISO, that either  					 assists consumers in performing this task or directly conducts criminal  					 background checks on prospective attendants for consumers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The availability of supportive intermediary services varies by  					 ISO model. However, some level of supportive services is key for consumers to  					 successfully participate in a CD-PAS program. </p>
<p>Therefore, state CD-PAS program agencies should incorporate  					 supportive intermediary services into their CD-PAS program no matter what other  					 ISO model is used. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISOs, and the agencies they subcontract with, vary in their  					 commitment to consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living  					 philosophy. </p>
<p>Therefore, states should develop performance standards in ISO  					 contracts that address the ISO's and their subcontractors' commitment to  					 consumer-directed principles and the Independent Living philosophy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State nurse practice acts and their effect on CD-PAS programs  					 vary from state to state. </p>
<p>Therefore, states should pursue exemptions to their nurse  					 practice acts if possible, or should seek to develop protocols permitting  					 delegation that are consistent with CD-PAS program goals and the Independent  					 Living philosophy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of states have considered personal care attendants to  					 be independent contractors and some continue to consider them as such even  					 though regulatory authorities have determined them to be <i>someone's  					 employee</i>. </p>
<p>Therefore, states should design programs with mechanisms  					 (including intermediary services) that assist consumers in complying with the  					 IRS rules for household employees and avoid referring to personal care  					 attendants as independent contractors. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of disability advocates and CD-PAS consumers  					 expressed concern about the potential impact of managed care on the  					 availability of CD-PAS to eligible consumers. </p>
<p>Therefore, state Medicaid managed care programs for the  					 elderly and persons with disabilities should be designed to include and  					 accommodate this important service option. </p>
