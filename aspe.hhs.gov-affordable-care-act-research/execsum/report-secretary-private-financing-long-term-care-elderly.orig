<h3 align="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The economic welfare of older persons in 1986 is better than at any  		point in our history, and most older persons can expect their senior years to  		be healthy and independent. However, the next 50 years will see the number of  		people age 65 and over almost double as a proportion of the  		population--reaching over 21 percent in the year 2030. The number of very  		old--people age 85 and over--will almost quadruple. Since the incidence of  		chronic health problems and disabling conditions which require long-term care  		significantly increases with age, few believe that the current system of  		financing and delivering long-term care services is adequate for the challenge  		ahead.</p>
<p><b>The great majority of older persons who need long-term care receive  		the support they need from friends and family members</b>. Nevertheless, in  		1985 the Nation spent over $35 billion a year on nursing home care, about 75  		percent of that on the elderly. Nursing home care represents about 8 percent of  		total health care expenditures, and it is the leading cause of catastrophic  		out-of-pocket expenditures for the elderly. This is true for several  		reasons:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The lifetime risk of needing nursing home care is between 20 and 45  			 percent. While only about half of those who enter nursing homes will stay over  			 90 days, for this subgroup the average stay is over two years. Despite the  			 improved economic status of older persons, few can afford the high cost of an  			 extended nursing home stay (averaging $22,000 per year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike acute health care, there is virtually no private insurance  			 for long-term care. Consequently, there are only two significant sources of  			 payments--out-of-pocket payments by the elderly and/or their families, and the  			 Medicaid program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the Medicaid program provides public financing for nursing  			 home care, it is a welfare-based system that does not provide assistance to  			 individuals until all other financial resources have been consumed.  			 Approximately half of all Medicaid recipients in nursing homes were not  			 initially poor, but "spent down" their income and resources as a result of  			 their nursing home stay.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>On February 4, 1986, President Reagan directed the Secretary of the  		Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis Bowen, to report to him by  		the end of the year on how Government and the private sector can work together  		to address catastrophic health care needs in the United States.</p>
<p>The purposes of this report are to:</p>
<ul><li>Describe the characteristics of elderly people who need long-term  		  care and how these characteristics will change over time;</li>
<li>Assess the potential of private financing mechanisms to lessen the  		  catastrophic impact of nursing home and home care expenses which can wipe out  		  individual and family savings; and</li>
<li>Develop actions that would increase the availability and use of  		  private financing mechanisms for the long-term care of older persons.</li>
</ul><p>This report addresses only one critical part of the problem of long-term  		care, albeit a highly neglected part. The focus on private financing strategies  		is not to deny the very real needs of persons who must rely on public programs  		to provide their long-term care because they cannot afford private  		alternatives. Such persons are and will continue to be the legitimate concern  		of government.</p>
<p>However, Federal, State, and local governments are already significant  		partners in sharing the costs of long-term care--paying almost half of all  		costs through Medicaid and other programs. The direct, out-of-pocket resources  		of individuals pay almost all the rest. The protective mechanisms relied upon  		for other types of health care expenses, such as private insurance and  		charitable sources, pay less than 2 percent of costs. <b>There need to be  		suitable, effective and widely available private financing mechanisms for the  		elderly who want to protect themselves at a reasonable cost against the high  		costs of long-term care</b>.</p>
<p>The findings of this report are based on a review of the existing  		literature, as well as analyses undertaken specifically for this report.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this report, the terms "elderly" and "older persons"  		refer to persons aged 65 and older. It is recognized, however, that these terms  		do not adequately reflect the diversity of this population.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">OVERVIEW</h3>
<p><b>Long-Term Care and Catastrophic Expenses</b>. Long-term care refers  		to a wide range of medical, health related, and social services for persons  		who, because of chronic mental or physical illness and disability, need  		personal assistance in caring for themselves over an extended period of time.  		While long-term care services can be provided in a variety of formal and  		informal settings, the majority of all long-term care is provided in the  		recipient's own home by family and friends.</p>
<p>A number of factors play a role in determining whether or not the need  		for long-term care will result in catastrophic expenses. These factors include:  		the severity of a person's disability; the type and duration of services  		needed; the living arrangements and the availability of family support; the  		source of payment (i.e., whether insurance or government will pay for services  		or whether they must be paid out-of-pocket); and the level of personal  		resources (income and assets) that are available; and the cumulative financial  		effect of previous acute or chronic care expenses.</p>
<p><b>Most people who require long-term care do not experience a  		catastrophic financial burden</b>. This is because the greatest portion of  		long-term care (71 percent) is provided in the home or community, rather than  		in the higher cost setting of a nursing home; and most home and community care  		(about 70 percent) is provided <b>totally</b> without payment by family members  		and friends. Among the disabled elderly living in the community who do receive  		some combination of formal (paid) and informal home and community care  		services, only a small percentage incur any significant out-of-pocket expense  		for their care.</p>
<p><b>High out-of-pocket expenditures for long-term care are most strongly  		associated with nursing home care</b>. However, even when nursing home care is  		used, it is important to note that approximately one-half of those who enter a  		nursing home will stay less than 90 days, and about 38 percent will stay less  		than 30 days.</p>
<p><b>The Long-Term Care Population and Service Needs</b>. Approximately  		five percent (1.4 million) of the 65 and over population resides in nursing  		homes. In addition, about 16 percent (4.6 million) of the elderly are disabled  		and living in the community. The great majority (3.7 million) of such disabled  		persons in the community need assistance because of limitations in what are  		termed "Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)": eating, using the toilet, mobility,  		bathing, and dressing. The rest have less severe limitations but need  		assistance with activities such as shopping, cooking and performing chores.</p>
<p>The number of older persons, and therefore the demand for long-term  		care, is expected to grow significantly in the future. In 1984, there were  		about 28 million persons age 65 or older in the U.S. By the year 2030, this  		number will grow to almost 65 million. In addition, the elderly population is  		itself becoming older. Between 1980 and 1990, the 75 to 84 year age group will  		increase twice as fast as the 65 to 75 year age group; and, in the subsequent  		two decades, the group 85 years and over will increase three to four times as  		fast as the general population. Since the likelihood of needing nursing home  		care increases with advancing age (as well as with being female, and with  		living alone), these demographic changes are likely to translate into  		significant increases in the demand for long-term care services.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to estimate lifetime risks, most recent studies  		indicate that an individual's chance of spending some time in a nursing home  		during his or her life ranges between 20 and 45 percent. The average length of  		stay in a nursing home is estimated to be 456 days. However, the nursing home  		population is a mix of short-term stayers, i.e., terminally ill patients,  		convalescent or rehabilitative patients who return to the community, and  		long-term stayers, i.e., patients with chronic illnesses such as Alzheimer's  		disease, who often remain in a nursing home for many years.</p>
<p>If advances from medical research and changes in prevention and  		treatment do not decrease the proportion of the population that becomes  		disabled, the number of elderly in nursing homes is projected to grow to 1.6  		million by 1990, 2.1 million in the year 2000, and 4.4 million in 2040.  		Similarly, the number of older persons with ADL limitations living in the  		community will rise to 4.2 million by 1990, 5.1 million by the year 2000, and  		10.2 million by 2040.</p>
<p><b>Long-Term Care Expenditures</b>. Total health care expenditures for  		persons aged 65 and older exceeded $119 billion in 1984. The largest category  		was hospital care (45 percent), followed by nursing home care (21 percent).  		However, in terms of direct out-of-pocket expenditures, nursing home care  		constituted the largest single expense category for the elderly, accounting for  		about 42 percent of total out-of-pocket health care expenditures. In contrast,  		hospital care accounted for only 5.6 percent of total out-of-pocket  		payments.</p>
<p>Separate estimates of the cost of home and community care services for  		the long-term care of the elderly are not currently available. However, 1983  		industry estimates put home care costs for the elderly in the approximate range  		of $3.0 billion.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Long-Term Care</b>. In 1984, $32 billion were spent for  		nursing home care for persons of all ages, accounting for 8.3 percent of total  		national health expenditures. Detailed information for 1985 is not yet  		available, but preliminary estimates indicate that 1985 total nursing home  		expenditures were $35.2 billion, about three-fourths of which was for nursing  		home services for the elderly. The 1984 nursing home care expenditures were  		almost equally divided between public and private sources. Approximately $15.8  		billion of the $16.3 billion spent in 1984 from private sources was  		out-of-pocket; and $13.9 billion of the $15.7 billion spent in.1984 from public  		sources was spent by Medicaid.</p>
<p><b>Home Health and Community-Based Services</b>. According to the 1982  		Long-Term Care Survey, 1.1 million of 4.6 million disabled elderly living in  		the community received some formal services from paid caregivers. Of these,  		about 600,000 individuals (12 percent) were estimated to have paid for some of  		their home care directly out-of-pocket, with median expenses being $40 a month  		and the average being $164 per month. Approximately 10 percent of the persons  		who had any out-of-pocket expenditures (i.e., 60,000 persons), had payments for  		home care services of over $400 per month.</p>
<p><b>Public Financing Programs</b>. While personal, family and private  		charitable resources are an essential and often dominant element of the  		long-term care system, Federal, State and local government programs also have a  		major effect on the nature, availability and costs of such services. In  		addition to Medicaid and Medicare, long-term care services and/or support are  		provided by the Veterans Administration (VA), the Office of Human Development  		Services (OHDS), and numerous State and local programs.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">THE IMPACT OF HEALTH, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TRENDS</h3>
<p><b>Trends in Chronic Disease and Disability</b>. The diseases which  		cause chronic disability are generally not those which lead to high mortality.  		About three-fourths of all disability is caused by dementia, arthritis,  		peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and hip and other  		fractures. Conversely, the major killers, such as heart disease and cancer,  		cause less than two percent of chronic disability.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, if current age-specific rates of disability  		continue, the number of disabled Americans with ADL limitations living in the  		community will grow from 3.7 million persons in 1984 to about 10.2 million  		persons in 2040. For example, with respect to Alzheimer's disease, it is  		estimated that perhaps only 1 percent of those under 65 have the disorder,  		while 15 percent of those over 85 are afflicted. In the absence of major  		treatment and prevention breakthroughs, the combination of chronic mental and  		physical disabilities will significantly increase the need for long-term care  		as the population ages.</p>
<p>Continuing technological advances may help to limit the impact of  		disabilities often associated with the need for long-term care services.  		Technological advances are currently under development in such areas as  		accident prevention, hip replacement, prevention of hearing loss, urinary  		incontinence devices, and assistance-summoning devices.</p>
<p><b>Societal Changes</b>. In addition to increased longevity, several  		other societal factors also may affect the future demand for long-term care.  		Between 1960 and 1984, the proportion of noninstitutionalized elderly living  		alone has increased from 19 percent to 30 percent. The majority of these people  		are older women who have outlived their spouses.</p>
<p>The major source of long-term care support for these widowed elderly is  		their children. While the increase in childbearing occurring over the past  		decade is expected to continue in the short-term, when the baby boom generation  		nears age 65 (around the year 2010), fewer elderly women are likely to have  		children to care for them. Another factor which affects the availability of  		family care is the geographic proximity of the parent and child. Between the  		1960s and the 1970s, the number of elderly moving from one State to another  		increased by 50 percent.</p>
<p>The willingness of adult children to provide support to their elderly  		parents is a major issue in projecting the need for formal long-term care. The  		increasing participation by women in the work force suggests that middle-aged  		daughters may have less time to provide assistance to their elderly parents.  		Nevertheless, the research that is available has found that middle-aged  		daughters who also work will make considerable personal sacrifice to care for  		elderly parents and that the commitment of young women to care for their  		parents remains strong.</p>
<p><b>Economic Status of the Elderly</b>. The economic status of the  		elderly has improved dramatically over the past two decades. The proportion of  		elderly living below the poverty line has decreased from 25 percent to 12  		percent. However, a significant number of the elderly are "near-poor" and are  		highly vulnerable to being poor. Poverty rates remain higher among elderly  		women, persons who live alone, the oldest old (85+) and minority populations,  		some of the very groups at highest risk for long-term care. In 1984, the  		average income of elderly families was $26,000; for unrelated elderly  		individuals, average income was $10,800.</p>
<p>Social Security benefits were the largest source of income for the  		elderly in 1984, averaging 37.6 percent of income for couples and 44.5 percent  		for individuals. Money from assets (savings, IRAs and stocks) was the second  		largest source of income for the elderly, averaging 27.6 percent for couples  		and 30.6 percent for individuals. Earnings and pensions also are significant  		sources of income for the elderly.</p>
<p>Home equity is the largest asset of older persons. In 1984, 75 percent  		of older persons owned their homes, and about 83 percent of this group owned  		them free and clear. The most recent figures from the U.S. Census indicate that  		the average home equity for persons aged 65 and over was $54,700 in 1984.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">ANALYSIS OF PROVIATE FINANCING MECHANISMS FOR LONG-TERM  		CARE OF THE ELDERLY</h3>
<p>Although there are several ways in which individuals can use their  		private resources to protect against the high costs of long-term care, the  		existing options for private financing are neither well developed nor widely  		used. It is the underlying premise of this report that private financing  		options for long-term care can play a larger role in our society than is  		currently the case.</p>
<p><b>General Approaches to Private Financing</b>. This report considers  		three basic approaches to the financing of care: cash accumulation, risk  		pooling and resource mobilization techniques. The strengths and weaknesses of  		various caregiver support strategies are also considered. Lastly, the report  		presents the results of special analyses which explore the potential of  		combinations of approaches.</p>
<p><b>Cash accumulation strategies</b> refer to savings mechanisms that  		encourage individuals to increase the resources available for future long-term  		care needs. The principal cash accumulation strategy examined in this report is  		the long-term care Individual Medical Account (IMA), which would provide  		Federal or State tax advantages for savings deposited in accounts earmarked for  		long-term care expenses.</p>
<p><b>Risk Pooling</b> refers to mechanisms which pool the resources of a  		large group of individuals at risk to pay for long-term care services which  		will be needed by a relatively small but unknown subset of the group. Three  		types of risk pooling mechanisms are examined:</p>
<ul><li><b>Long-term care insurance</b>, which pools the premiums of a group  		  of beneficiaries to cover the risk of needing extended nursing home care,  		  intermediate care or home health services</li>
<li><b>Social health maintenance organizations (SHMOS)</b>, which use the  		  pre-paid, capitated (i.e., set fee per person), case management approach of  		  health maintenance organizations to provide long-term care benefits to groups  		  of individuals</li>
<li><b>Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs)</b>, which  		  typically provide older persons with a package of benefits that includes  		  residential, health, social and custodial services, in return for an entrance  		  fee and monthly charges</li>
</ul><p><b>Resource mobilization</b> refers to financing mechanisms that enable  		individuals to convert non-liquid resources to cash, thus enhancing an  		individual's ability to pay for long-term care services. Two types of resource  		mobilization approaches are considered:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Home equity conversion (EEC) plans</b> allow a homeowner to  			 convert the equity in a home into a stream of income without having to move or  			 make immediate repayment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Employee benefit options for retirees</b> refer to the addition  			 of long-term care benefits as an option in the package of pension or health  			 benefits offered employees.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Caregiver support strategies</b> refer to mechanisms designed to  		strengthen and expand the existing informal network of long-term care provided  		by families in the home and in the community. This network is essential to the  		success of private financing mechanisms because home and community-based  		services usually are provided at no cost to the patient and because it keeps  		disabled older persons with their families, where most persons would prefer to  		be. Two types of caregiver support strategies are examined:</p>
<ul><li><b>Tax allowances for home care</b>, which provide special tax  		  credits, deductions, or cash subsidies to assist family members in providing  		  home care services for an elderly dependent</li>
<li><b>Volunteer systems</b>, in which organizations and individuals  		  assist others in providing unpaid long-term care services to older persons in  		  the community</li>
<li><b>Combination financing approaches</b> are designed to improve the  		  effectiveness of one financing mechanism by blending its attractive features  		  with that of another. This report analyzes the potential of a variety of  		  combinations, including the development of long-term care IMAs that have a risk  		  pool feature.</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC PRIVATE FINANCING MECHANISMS</h3>
<p><b><i>Long-Term Care Individual Medical Accounts (IMAs)</i></b></p>
<p>A variety of proposals have been advanced which would permit individuals  		to establish tax-favored accounts dedicated, in whole or in part, to the  		purchase of long-term care health services. In May 1986, Colorado became the  		first State to enact legislation creating a tax-favored IMA and is in the  		process of implementing its planned program.</p>
<p>Because IMA proposals are new, analysts assessing the potential impact  		of various IMA proposals have used the Federal experience with Individual  		Retirement Accounts (IRAs) as a base for estimating the number of persons  		likely to establish an IMA if given an opportunity (i.e., the participation  		rate) and for estimating the amounts likely to be saved.</p>
<p>Although participation rates varied considerably by income level, only  		15.4 percent of all tax returns showed a contribution to an IRA in 1984. About  		9.5 percent of all taxpayer returns contributed the maximum tax-favored amount.  		The Treasury Department estimates revenue losses of $14.4 billion in 1986 from  		IRAs, some of which will be recovered in later years as future withdrawals are  		taxed.</p>
<p>Most analysts consider the IRA participation and savings rates to be an  		upper limit on a voluntary IMA program. This is because IMA proposals place  		more restrictions on the use of funds by the saver and, therefore, are less  		flexible and less attractive to the public as a savings device. The financial  		incentives of IMA proposals will be altered by the tax reform legislation. The  		legislation affects deductions for medical expenses and IRA contributions, as  		well as overall rates of taxation.</p>
<p>A critical issue in considering IMA proposals is the amount a person  		must save to pay for future long-term care should it be needed. Individual  		savings must be sufficient to cover the high costs of nursing home care (which  		averaged $22,000 in 1984). The problem is compounded by inflation rates, which  		are rising faster in the nursing home sector than in the general economy. A  		significant amount must be saved every year if a person wishes to accumulate  		sufficient funds to cover the average nursing home stay. Yet, the majority of  		persons are likely to need no paid long-term care services.</p>
<p>Because of this latter phenomenon, called "target inefficiency", IMA  		proposals which have a risk pooling dimension (such as that proposed by Bowen  		and Burke in <b>Federation of American Hospitals Review</b>, December 1985) are  		somewhat more promising. As discussed below, such combinations lower the amount  		individuals need to save.</p>
<p><b><i>Freestanding Long-Term Care Insurance</i></b></p>
<p>Freestanding long-term care insurance is insurance that provides payment  		for long-term care services in an institution or a person's home. The policy  		covers chronic care services needed for an extended period of time, rather than  		the acute, recuperative or rehabilitative care covered by Medicare and medigap  		policies. Beneficiaries are free to select their own provider within general  		qualifying guidelines.</p>
<p>The market for long-term care insurance is still in an early stage of  		development. According to the American Health Care Association, there were  		about 25 long-term care insurance products being sold in 1986, many of which  		were new entries into the market. Most policies have been sold on an individual  		rather than a group basis. Estimates of the total number of policies sold range  		from 50,000 to 300,000.</p>
<p>Although there is considerable diversity among the long-term care  		insurance products, all focus on nursing home care, with only limited (or no)  		custodial and home care benefits. Benefits are structured as indemnity plans,  		paying fixed amount per day (usually not indexed for inflation), with waiting  		periods before coverage begins and coverage from two to six years.</p>
<p>Products have traditionally been sold to persons of retirement age,  		although marketing for a few newer products has been expanded to earlier age  		groups. Premiums differ substantially among companies. According to a Money  		Magazine article that appeared in March 1986, a 65 year old person could pay  		from $174 to $1,451 for policies that cover differing ranges of skilled and  		custodial care.</p>
<p>The principal strengths of freestanding insurance as a mechanism for  		financing long-term care include: 1) long-term care insurance addresses the  		major cause of catastrophic expense among the elderly by focusing primarily on  		the nursing home risk; 2) long-term care insurance provides affordable  		protection for many individuals; and 3) long-term care insurance can  		potentially relieve upward cost pressures on Medicaid by slowing or eliminating  		the spend-down process for insured persons.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the mechanism include: 1) existing products reinforce  		the bias toward institutional care, a bias that is both costly and contrary to  		the preference of most older persons for home care services; 2) the insurance  		does not provide complete catastrophic coverage and generally pays fixed  		benefits that can be eroded by inflation; 3) at present, the premium levels for  		complete coverage are higher than many older persons can afford; 4) the  		freestanding product, which separates long-term care from acute care, reduces  		the incentive to manage the total spectrum of care and leads to the marketing  		of two insurance products, with possible overlap and confusion for purchasers;  		and 5) marketing to individuals rather than groups raises premium costs and can  		more easily lead to adverse selection.</p>
<p>Research indicates that there is substantial room for growth in the  		long-term care insurance market. Two major studies have estimated the number of  		persons over age 65 who could afford long-term care insurance. One placed the  		number in the range of 4.7 million elderly, and the other placed the number in  		the range of about 7.0 million elderly. However, because neither study factored  		in the effects of inflation over time, the estimates may be high. Various  		linkages have been proposed to enhance the marketability of long-term care  		insurance including:</p>
<ul><li><b>Medicare Super Supplements</b> that include both acute and  		  long-term care benefits and create an opportunity to coordinate benefits</li>
<li><b>Medicare-HMOs</b> in which HMOs integrate an optional long-term  		  care insurance package with their traditional acute care services for Medicare  		  beneficiaries and provide appropriate case management for all services</li>
<li><b>Medicare Vouchers</b> under which Medicare beneficiaries would  		  have the option of receiving a voucher covering the Medicare part of the cost  		  of purchasing private insurance that not only covers Medicare acute care  		  services but could include long-term care benefits</li>
<li><b>Retirement Community Reinsurance</b> with CCRCs establishing joint  		  ventures with insurance carriers to underwrite the CCRCs' chronic care  		  guarantee</li>
<li><b>Continuing Care at Home</b> models that enable participants to buy  		  into a long-term care risk pool that has a managed care component</li>
<li><b>Combined Life and Long-Term Care Insurance</b> to balance  		  different lifetime risks and encourage the purchase of long-term care  		  protection at younger ages</li>
</ul><p>Several States including Washington, California and Colorado, have  		initiated programs which help consumers select long-term care insurance  		protection. Developing an appropriate regulatory environment has been difficult  		for States because of the unfamiliarity of long-term care insurance, which  		combines features of both health and life insurance. Efforts to protect  		consumers have sometimes inadvertently worked to stifle the market. A recent  		study by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may help clarify  		issues and serve as a basis for model laws and regulations.</p>
<p><b><i>Social Health Maintenance Organizations</i></b></p>
<p>A social health maintenance organization (SHMO) is a managed system of  		health and long-term care services in which a single provider entity assumes  		responsibility for a full range of acute and chronic care under a fixed budget  		that is prospectively determined. At present, development of the SHMO concept  		is highly experimental, being tested by the Health Care Financing  		Administration (HCFA) in four demonstrations that began operation in March  		1985. The demonstrations, selected to represent different organizational  		possibilities, includes sites in Portland, Oregon; Brooklyn, New York;  		Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Long Beach, California.</p>
<p>The benefit package offered includes all Medicare benefits, plus a range  		of long-term care and other supplemental benefits. Copayments for long-term  		care services are required and long-term care benefits are subject to annual  		dollar maximums which range from $5,000 to $12,000. The financing arrangements  		of the demonstrations vary but include capitated payments (which are pooled)  		from Medicare (for all enrollees), Medicaid (for eligibles) and private  		enrollees (for non-Medicaid enrollees).</p>
<p>Although SHMOs may have the potential of reaching a large target  		population, they are still in the early stages of development and can only be  		operated by explicit statutory waivers of existing program requirements. An  		independent evaluation of the SHMO demonstration program is being conducted by  		the University of California, San Francisco and will be completed in 1990.</p>
<p><b><i>Continuing Care Retirement Communities</i></b></p>
<p>The continuing care retirement community (CCRC) is a financially  		self-sufficient residential community for the elderly that offers medical and  		nursing services in specialized facilities. It is based on a lifetime contract  		between the CCRC and each resident that defines each party's financial and  		service obligations.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, one of the requirements for admission to a CCRC is that the  		resident be covered by Medicare and own a medigap insurance policy. As a  		consequence, nursing home care is the key service added and guaranteed as part  		of the basic CCRC arrangement. Most CCRCs have their own nursing home  		facilities within the community. Increasingly, however, CCRCs are contracting  		with outside facilities to provide needed nursing home care. CCRCs are also  		beginning to contract with private insurance companies to insure or reinsure  		nursing home services.</p>
<p>The number of CCRCs is relatively small, with estimates ranging from 300  		to 400 communities, serving 100,000 to 200,000 persons. The industry is growing  		rapidly, with the potential of developing 1,500 more communities by 1990,  		housing a total of 500,000 persons or two percent of the older population.</p>
<p>Entrance fees range from $15,000 to $175,000, depending in part on the  		size of the residential unit and the extent of the health care services  		guaranteed. Monthly service fees range from $300 to upwards of $2,000. Some  		CCRCs offer contracts in which fees are totally or partially refundable to  		residents who leave or to their heirs upon death.</p>
<p>CCRCs have attracted the middle class almost exclusively, often former  		professionals with pensions. Research indicates that 10 to 20 percent of older  		persons could afford CCRC residence.</p>
<p>Many of the early CCRCs guaranteed total health care for life to  		residents and were known as "life care communities". Due to inflation, high  		interest rates and poor actuarial estimates, the costs of providing such  		guaranteed health care exceeded revenues and led to financial problems in a  		number of CCRCs, as well as to a few bankruptcies. Although the terms "life  		care community" and CCRC often are used interchangeably, the newer  		CCRCs guarantee a more limited range of health care services, with additional  		services being billed separately.</p>
<p>A number of States have developed legislation aimed at defining life  		care communities, regulating contracts between communities and residents, and  		requiring financial disclosure. States without specific life care legislation  		often review requirements for nursing home beds to be built in CCRCs or  		implement other State health planning requirements. In addition, the American  		Association of Homes for the Aging, which represents the predominant non-profit  		sector, is developing rigorous accreditation standards to safeguard the quality  		and financial integrity of CCRCs.</p>
<p><b><i>Home Equity Conversion Plans</i></b></p>
<p>Home equity conversion (HEC) plans are designed to allow a homeowner to  		convert the equity in a home into a stream of income, without having to move or  		make immediate repayment. HEC plans differ from home equity loans, which  		require the homeowner to begin repayment immediately. The assets freed through  		the HEC plan can be used for any purpose, including the purchase of long-term  		care services. Although HEC plans have been available since 1961, in 1985 fewer  		than 1,000 bank or mortgage company financed HEC loans are thought to exist  		nationwide.</p>
<p>The equity held is usually the older persons most important financial  		asset, yet it may be difficult to use without having to sell and move from the  		home. Seventy-five percent (13.4 million) of households headed by older persons  		in 1984 were homeowners, and most (83 percent) owned their homes free of debt.  		According to the Census Bureau, the average home equity for persons aged 65 and  		over was $54,700 in 1984. The aggregate home equity held by the elderly is  		estimated at $700 billion.</p>
<p>There are three basic types of HEC plans in use. <b>Open term reverse  		mortgages</b>, the most common commercial type, pay monthly cash advances to  		the homeowner until he or she dies, reaches age 100 or moves. The effective  		annual interest rate for this type of mortgage depends on how long the borrower  		lives in the home and the home's rate of appreciation. In general, the interest  		rate is very high for loans repaid after a short term but tends to decline the  		longer the borrower is able to remain in the home.</p>
<p>The second type of HEC mechanism is the <b>sale plan</b>, which enables  		the owner to sell his home while retaining occupancy rights. The city of  		Buffalo, New York has been a major public developer of a life estate form of  		sale plan. Under Buffalo's program, elderly homeowners sell their house to a  		non-profit entity established by the city in return for a monthly cash annuity  		for life or lump sum payment. The entity also rehabilitates, maintains and pays  		the taxes on the house until the owner's death. Through 1985, the program had  		undertaken about 650 contracts.</p>
<p><b>Special purpose loans</b> are a third type of HEC plan used by a  		number of States to provide older homeowners with low interest home equity  		loans that do not have to be repaid until the borrower dies or sells the home.  		As used to date, the loans have been designed to help older persons remain in  		their homes, rather than to pay for long-term care expenses or insurance.</p>
<p>Research findings on the utility of HEC mechanisms for long-term care  		needs are mixed. One major study by researchers at ICF, Inc. concluded that  		annuities paid out by HEC plans are not sufficient to generate substantial  		increases in the number of elderly able to afford long-term care insurance. A  		study by Jacobs and Weissert in 1983, which adopted different assumptions,  		concluded that about 5.1 million homeowners could pay for insurance with their  		home equity payments. Preliminary analyses by Manton and Liu indicate that HEC  		payment levels would pay the out-of-pocket home care costs for a large number  		of disabled elderly.</p>
<p>From the point of view of financing long-term care, a major weakness of  		HEC mechanisms is that is that use of the funds is entirely discretionary  		(except special purpose HEC loans) and may not end up being used for long-term  		care expenses. In addition, the mortgage arrangements are complex for both  		lender and homeowner and older persons have demonstrated strong reluctance to  		borrow against their home.</p>
<p><b><i>Employee Benefit Options for Retirees</i></b></p>
<p>The addition of long-term care coverage as a option in the package of  		pension or health insurance benefits offered to retirees has been suggested as  		one approach to private financing of long-term care for the elderly. A majority  		of workers are covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan and a significant  		number of companies provide health insurance after retirement.</p>
<p>Few companies are now offering long-term care benefits. While there is  		some suggestion of corporate, employee and labor interest in changing this  		situation, major barriers exist and a combination of legal, accounting and  		statutory changes will probably be necessary before many companies will get  		involved.</p>
<p>The barriers to progress in this area are several. First, employers are  		increasingly concerned about their large and unfunded liabilities for retiree  		health and welfare benefits. Benefits are not only becoming a significant  		percent of payroll but, due to an accounting change under consideration, may  		soon be required to be disclosed as unfunded liabilities on the financial  		disclosure statement of companies. Adding to the reluctance to expand benefits  		are recent court rulings indicating that employers may not be permitted to  		terminate or cut back on any defined health benefit promised to retirees.</p>
<p>These factors combine to make employers wary of adding any new benefit  		for long-term care, where demand and costs are expected to grow substantially  		in the future, unless it is pre-funded. However, recent policy changes under  		the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 eliminated the tax advantages of pre-funding  		retirement health benefits by subjecting investment earnings on retirement  		health plan assets to current income taxation.</p>
<p>Despite these very real problems, employers could develop long-term care  		insurance options for retirees. For example, insurance for long-term care could  		be provided by employers as an additional fringe benefit choice, or employers  		could simply help form a group so that interested employees could purchase  		insurance. In this regard, the Federal Government might well be in a position  		to provide leadership through its Federal Employees Health Benefits  		Program.</p>
<p>The principal immediate strength of employer-based groups for long-term  		care financing lies in its potential to expand the market for long-term care  		insurance. Insurance offered through employer groups would be likely to carry  		significantly lower premiums, since the risk of adverse selection and marketing  		costs are minimized in this approach.</p>
<p>Employers could also establish programs which help support employees  		caring for disabled family members or which help retirees obtain the services  		they need. A restructuring of pension payout plans to allow for lump sum  		withdrawals is another way of assisting retirees meet their long-term care  		expenses.</p>
<p><b><i>Tax Allowances for Family Caregiving</i></b></p>
<p>Currently, family caregivers provide most of the long-term assistance  		given to functionally disabled persons living in the community. Public policy  		support for family caregivers is advocated on the grounds that it can prevent  		costly institutionalization by reducing the incidence of family "burnout";  		relieve the excessive financial and emotional burden on caregivers; and ease  		the conflicts between work and caregiving responsibilities.</p>
<p>Subject to a number of restrictions, current federal tax policy provides  		three tools for targeting subsidies to taxpayer households in which dependent  		elderly persons are living: 1) a $1,000 exemption permitted for each elderly  		dependent supported by the taxpayer; 2) deductions for medical expenses of  		dependents if expenses exceed 7.5 percent of income; and 3) a tax credit given  		employed taxpayers for the care expenses of a disabled spouse or dependent,  		under the Child and Dependent Care Credit provisions of the current tax  		code.</p>
<p>None of these tools are widely used by taxpayers nor, as presently  		structured, are they considered very influential on a family's decisions about  		whether or not to institutionalize an elderly person. Social and emotional  		factors typically weigh more heavily than the financial burden in such  		decisions.</p>
<p>There are numerous Congressional proposals pending which propose further  		tax benefits for family caregivers. Most build on the child and dependent care  		credit and attempt to remove or reduce some of the limitations such as the  		requirement that all taxpayers in the household must be gainfully employed.</p>
<p>Some of the more substantial ideas for assisting family caregivers  		through the tax system have been developed by the States. Arizona has adopted  		an unusual variation which permits taxpayers to deduct eligible medical  		expenses for any elderly person, whether or not they are a relative, living in  		the State.</p>
<p>Tax subsidy approaches typically assist working caregivers, rather than  		persons who drop out of the workforce in order to provide another's care. The  		caregivers who leave or reduce their employment pay a price in foregone  		earnings and probably also in lower future earnings, both of which will lower  		his or her later Social Security benefits. To offset this, proposals have been  		put forward to allow family caregivers to deduct those years in which they  		provided care from the usual total earning period (35 years) mandated for other  		Social Security beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Family caregiving may also be assisted by changes in employment  		policies. More flexible work and leave policies, counseling programs and  		work-based caregiver support groups have started to attract the attention of  		business and other groups. A 1985 study by Traveler's Insurance Company found  		that about 1 in 5 of all company employees over aged 30 had caregiving  		responsibility for an elderly relative. Other research indicates that the  		conflict between work and caregiving responsibilities shows up in greater  		tardiness, lower productivity, and more depression.</p>
<p><b><i>Volunteer Systems and Service Exchange</i></b></p>
<p>Volunteer work is work or assistance performed without compensation  		except for expenses incidental to performing the volunteer role, such as  		supervision, training costs or assistance with transportation. Volunteerism is  		an important component of the Nation's public and private services systems.  		Surveys indicate that almost half of all Americans do some sort of volunteer  		work. Many of these volunteers are over age 65 and the number of older  		volunteers is expected to increase at twice the rate of growth for the older  		population itself.</p>
<p>Although many charitable organizations assist with the needs of the  		elderly, the continuum of long-term care is not a traditional focus for most  		organized volunteer services. In attempting to envision how volunteers can play  		an increasing role in meeting the long-term care needs of the dependent  		elderly, several principles emerge:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Volunteer approaches will vary widely because they need to be  			 developed and supported by individuals and community organizations to fit  			 community needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteers serve to complement paid staff and cannot replace the  			 specialized expertise of professional caregivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional knowledge is needed to support the widespread involvement  			 of volunteers in long-term care, e.g., to identify appropriate assignments and  			 to strike a proper balance between paid staff and volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteer efforts cost time and money, especially those done well.  			 While the value of volunteer efforts can far exceed operational costs,  			 financial assistance is needed for coordination, training and other related  			 costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future approaches need to build on existing organizations and  			 systems, rather than create new ones. There are a number of volunteer programs  			 providing services for the disabled elderly, with national, State and local  			 sponsors.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Special Analysis of Individual Medical Accounts (IMAs). Long-Term  		Care Insurance and Combined Financing Strategies</i></b></p>
<p>In March 1986, the Department initiated a series of special analyses  		designed to assess the potential of IMAs, long-term care insurance and  		insurance combinations for protecting consumers against the expenses of nursing  		home care. A total of seven financing prototypes and scenarios were developed  		and their likely future impact on out-of-pocket and Medicaid expenditures was  		explored using economic simulations and projections up to the year 2018. The  		following approaches and scenarios were examined:</p>
<ol><li>an expansion of the current limit on IRAs to include dedicated  		  savings for long-term care;</li>
<li>replacement of current IRAs with IMAs;</li>
<li>long-term care insurance based on an existing private market  		  policy;</li>
<li>IMAs combined with an insurance (i.e., risk pool) feature;</li>
<li>long-term care insurance on a wide scale, provided as an employee  		  (pension) benefit;</li>
<li>limited coverage long-term care insurance purchased by medigap  		  policyholders; and</li>
<li>varying coverage long-term care insurance, with premiums targeted to  		  1 percent of income.</li>
</ol><p><b>It is emphasized that the work performed in developing these  		projections was highly experimental and the findings should be viewed  		accordingly.</b></p>
<p>The special analyses were limited to study of nursing home care  		expenditures only, primarily because nursing home care is the major cause of  		catastrophic health expenditures for the elderly. In addition, however, there  		are no national data on home care expenditures by <b>source of payment</b> to  		provide a reasonable base for prototype assumptions.</p>
<p>In order to assess the future impact of financing proposals, several  		prototypes were designed with specific features incorporated. Assumptions were  		made about who would participate, how much it would cost for what kind of  		coverage, and how factors such as inflation and induced demand would be  		factored. To the extent that these assumptions ultimately prove realistic, the  		simulation findings may be a valid approximation of the possibilities of each  		proposal.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that several of the prototypes and  		simulations were designed for exploratory purposes only and were not designed  		to test "realism". Rather, they were intended to give the researchers a general  		indication of the "upper bound", or maximum, limits of a particular approach.  		Further analysis of more realistic variations was undertaken only when the  		upper bound results showed promise.</p>
<p>The micro-simulation model used to estimate the impact of the various  		financing approaches was developed by the Brookings Institution and ICF,  		Incorporated. The model is based on data and assumptions that allow the user to  		estimate patterns of earnings, asset accumulation, and disability, and the  		effect of these factors on the utilization and financing of long-term care over  		the years 1986 to 2020. <b>One significant limitation of the model is that it  		does not cover the likely peak disability Years of the "baby boom" generation  		born between 1945 and 1960</b>. Some important simplifying assumptions included  		in the model are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Supply is assumed to adjust to demand</b>. Trends in the supply  			 of nursing home beds have been erratic and no readily available methods exist  			 to forecast supply. This assumption is thought to be fairly reasonable for the  			 long modeling period used;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The findings discussed below assume a 5.8 percent per year  			 increase in nursing home charges</b>, the same as given in the Old Age  			 Survivors and Disability Insurance and Health Insurance (OASDI and HI) Trustees  			 Reports, Alternative II-B. The general inflation rate assumed is 4.0 percent  			 per year, again the same estimate used in the OASDI and HI Trustees  			 Report;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The age-specific rates of utilization of nursing home services  			 were held constant</b>, with only minor adjustments to the 1977 data used to  			 develop the rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model assumes that persons will first spend their current  			 income for long-term care-then their assets, and finally will draw on  			 Medicaid</b>. No divestiture of assets to others to qualify for Medicaid is  			 assumed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The baseline estimates, which provide the basis for comparing the  		results of the options analyzed, project nursing home expenditures for the  		elderly as follows (<b>in 1987 dollars</b>):</p>

<p><b>Expanded IRA Prototype</b> Under this option, the tax-favored savings  		limit of current IRAs would be increased by $1,000, raising the maximum  		contribution to $3,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a working couple.</p>
<ul><li>The additional $1,000 is treated as an individual medical account for  		  nursing home expenses;</li>
<li>After age 65, funds may be withdrawn from the IRA to pay for nursing  		  home expenses without payment of taxes. Withdrawals for other purposes would  		  continue to be taxed at current marginal rate;</li>
<li>The requirement that individuals begin withdrawals from their IRA  		  savings by age 70 1/2 is removed and contributions are permitted  		  indefinitely;</li>
<li>It is assumed that all those who save the additional $1,000 would  		  leave it untouched until the need for long-term care arises, or until  		  death;</li>
<li>It is assumed that 90 percent of those who saved the maximum in 1983  		  would save to the new maximum of $3,000.</li>
</ul><p><b>Projected Impact</b></p>
<ul><li>Some IMA funds would be held by 28 percent of persons aged 65 and  		  over by the year 2018;</li>
<li>Additional IMA savings would pay for about 3.0 percent ($2.9 billion)  		  of total nursing home costs by 2018;</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket spending would be reduced by 4.3 percent compared to  		  the base case;</li>
<li>Medicaid spending would be reduced by 1.3 percent.</li>
</ul><p><b>Replacement IMA Prototype</b> This prototype was developed as a gross  		"upper bound" model, to explore the possibilities of IMAs in the event that  		Congressional tax reform actions eliminate IRAs for those with pensions. It is  		considered useful only as an general order-of-magnitude probe.</p>
<ul><li>Assumes that IRAs are eliminated entirely;</li>
<li>IMAs for long-term care would be established, with a maximum  		  contribution of $2,000 per year tax deduction;</li>
<li>Assumes that everyone who currently participates in IRAs would  		  contribute the same amount to an IMA;</li>
<li>Tax treatment of contributions and earned interest is unchanged;</li>
<li>The amounts saved would be tax free if used for long-term care  		  purposes after age 65.</li>
</ul><p><b>Projected Impact</b></p>
<ul><li>IMA savings would pay for 8.5 percent ($8.4 billion) of total nursing  		  home expenditures by the year 2018;</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenditures would be reduced by 11.9 percent;</li>
<li>Medicaid expenditures would be reduced by 3.9 percent.</li>
</ul><p><b>Long-Term Care Insurance--Private Market Policy</b> This option  		modeled a new policy recently issued by Fireman's Fund which offers 6 years of  		long-term care coverage, with an optional inflation-adjusted benefit. Other  		features include a 100 day deductible, $50 per day benefit, and a three day  		prior hospitalization requirement. A very limited home benefit is included. The  		annual premium charged at age 65 is $506.</p>
<ul><li>Persons were assumed to buy the insurance if they could afford it for  		  less than 5 percent of their income and if they have $10,000 or more in  		  assets;</li>
<li>It is assumed that, in 1986, persons aged 67 to 81 will purchase the  		  policy. After 1986, policies will be purchased at age 67.</li>
<li>No one who is disabled will be allowed to purchase the policy.  		  Persons who become disabled will continue to hold the policy;</li>
<li>Once a policy is purchased, coverage is continued as long as premiums  		  are less than 7 percent of income and the person has $10,000 in assets;</li>
<li>Induced demand is reportedly factored into premiums but, due to  		  proprietary considerations, the rate is not known.</li>
</ul><p><b>Projected Impact</b></p>
<ul><li>About 23 percent of those age 65 and over would own the Fireman's  		  Fund policy in the year 2018;</li>
<li>About 7 percent of total nursing home expenditures would be paid by  		  insurance by 2018;</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenditures would decline by about 12 percent;</li>
<li>Medicaid expenditures would decline by less than 2 percent.</li>
</ul><p><b>IMA Combined with a Risk Pool (Insurance) Feature</b> Under this  		option, a variation of the Bowen-Burke proposal, IMAs would be established with  		all contributions deposited into an individual account, along with one-half the  		interest earned. The other half of the interest is placed in a pooled fund and  		is used to pay a $50 per day benefit to persons with long-term care needs who  		have exhausted their own account. All interest on the pooled fund remains in  		the pooled fund. Amounts remaining in the account at death go to the  		estate.</p>
<ul><li>It is assumed that 90 percent of all persons who contributed the IRA  		  maximum in 1983 will contribute an additional sum to the IMA;</li>
<li>Without an induced demand factor, the initial annual contribution  		  necessary for a person age 40 would be $943, and for a person age 60 would be  		  $2,628, over and above the IRA maximum.</li>
<li>If induced demand is factored in (37 percent), the initial annual  		  contribution necessary for a person age 40 would be $1,497 and, for a person  		  age 60 would be $3,603, over and above the IRA maximum;</li>
<li>The level of necessary contributions would rise at the rate of  		  inflation, currently estimated at 5.8 percent for the nursing home sector;</li>
<li>The level of contributions necessary to assure solvency of the pooled  		  fund were calculated by the Department's Office of the Actuary;</li>
<li>Contributions are waived while an individual is in a nursing home at  		  age 65 or older.</li>
</ul><p><b>Projected Impact</b></p>
<ul><li>About 29 percent of those age 65 and over would have a combination  		  IMA account in 2018;</li>
<li>Funds saved in the combination accounts would pay about 8 percent of  		  total nursing home expenditures in 2018;</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenses would be reduced about 11 percent;</li>
<li>Medicaid expenditures would be reduced about 4 percent.</li>
</ul><p><b>Long-Term Care Insurance Linked to Pension Benefits</b> This scenario  		linking insurance to pension benefits was developed as a preliminary upper  		bound test of significantly broader-based participation than is now the case  		for long-term care insurance models. It is not considered 'realistic, in the  		near term because of the barriers to broadening pension benefits discussed  		earlier in the analysis.</p>
<ul><li>It was assumed that, beginning in 1987, all persons aged 65 and older  		  who start to receive pension benefits of $1,000 or more per year would receive  		  a long-term care insurance policy. The policy would cover a 2 year nursing home  		  stay, have a 90 day deductible period and pay $50 per day in 1986 dollars for  		  nursing home care;</li>
<li>One half of the cost of the insurance is deducted from the  		  pension;</li>
<li>Induced demand is not factored into premium estimates.</li>
</ul><p><b>Projected Impact</b></p>
<ul><li>Under these assumptions, about 35 percent of those age 65 and over  		  would have a long-term care insurance policy in the year 2018;</li>
<li>Insurance would pay about 11 percent of total nursing home  		  expenditures in 2018;</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenditures would decline by 11 percent;</li>
<li>Medicaid expenditures would decline by nearly 8 percent.</li>
</ul><p><b>Limited Coverage Long-Term Care Insurance Purchased by Medigap  		Policyholders</b> This prototype investigated the impact of limited coverage  		long-term care insurance if purchased by persons who have already demonstrated  		a willingness to supplement their acute care coverage, i.e., medigap  		policyholders. Surveys indicate that the percentage of older persons who  		purchased one or more medigap policies ranged from about 53 percent for persons  		just above the poverty level, to 77 percent for upper income groups.</p>
<ul><li>It is assumed that, beginning in 1987, persons aged 67 and over who  		  had purchased a medigap policy, also purchased a 1 year long-term care  		  insurance policy with a $50 per day benefit and 90 day deductible;</li>
<li>Induced demand is not factored into premiums.</li>
</ul><p><b>Projected Impact</b></p>
<ul><li>About 55 percent of those aged 65 and over would have a one year  		  policy in the year 2018;</li>
<li>Insurance would pay about 18 percent of total nursing home care  		  expenditures;</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenditures would be reduced about 12 percent;</li>

</ul><p><b>Varying Coverage Long-Term Care Insurance with Premiums Targeted at 1  		Percent of Income</b> Assuming some long-term care insurance coverage might be  		better than no protection, this prototype simulates the impact of providing  		persons with varying levels of insurance, depending on what they could purchase  		with 1 percent of income.</p>
<ul><li>It is assumed that, beginning in 1987, persons age 30 and over  		  purchase the maximum coverage available (1 to 6 years or unlimited) that costs  		  no more than 1 percent of their income. Policies would pay $50 per day benefit,  		  with a 90 day deductible period;</li>
<li>If premium exceeds 2 percent of income for three consecutive years  		  while under age 65, the coverage is dropped by 2 years (or from no limit to 6  		  years;</li>
<li>Persons aged 65 or over in 1987 are assumed to purchase the longest  		  coverage that costs no more than 3 percent of income, if assets are $10,000 or  		  more. If premiums exceed 5 percent of income for three consecutive years, then  		  the coverage is dropped by 2 years;</li>

<li>Out-of-pocket expenditures would decline by about 18 percent;</li>
<li>Medicaid expenditures would decline by about 12 percent.</li>
</ul><p><b><i>The Effect of-Induced Demand on Projected Impacts</i></b></p>
<p>Experience has shown that when the direct cost of a health service is  		reduced for a consumer, either due to lower costs or increased payment by a  		third party (insurance), demand for that health service increases. Although the  		decision to enter a nursing home is generally considered a 'last resort,  		decision, it is reasonable to assume that financial considerations play some  		role. Should nursing home insurance (public or private) become more widely  		available, the financial barriers will be reduced and entry into nursing homes  		will be facilitated. Utilization rates for nursing homes can be expected to  		rise.</p>
<p>The problem for researchers and insurance companies is, "What level of  		additional induced demand will be generated by widespread use of long-term care  		insurance mechanisms?" No reliable data are available for the precise  		determination of what the rate should be.</p>
<p>Most persons agree that induced demand in the nursing home sector will  		be less than has been the case with acute care, because of the biases against  		entering a nursing home. The level will also be affected by the broadness of  		the coverage offered, i.e., the cost to the consumer of using the policy.  		Factors such as up-front deductibles (elimination periods) and copayments  		(benefits may cover all or only part of the daily cost) can be expected to  		significantly affect the induced demand factor.</p>
<p>The factors used in this report are based on the expert judgement of the  		Office of the Actuary (Social Security Administration) and could arguably be  		more or less. Detail concerning the effect of induced demand on premiums or  		contributions is provided in the full report.</p>
<p>An example of the effect of induced demand can be seen by comparing the  		results of the last option cited above (Long-Term Care Insurance/Premiums  		Targeted at 1 Percent) with the projected impact of the same option when  		induced demand is factored at 11 percent. When induced demand is considered,  		overall expenditures for nursing home care increase by 2.3 percent. The amount  		of total nursing home expenditures paid by insurance is 15 percent, rather than  		17 percent; out-of-pocket expenses are reduced by 14 percent, rather than 18  		percent; and, Medicaid expenditures are reduced by about 9 percent, rather than  		12 percent.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">THE RELATIONSHIP OF MEDICAID TO PRIVATE FINANCING  		MECHANISMS</h3>
<p>Medicaid was established in 1966 as a joint Federal-State program to  		provide medical assistance to certain groups of low-income individuals. About  		half of total Medicaid expenditures in 1984 were for long-term care, including  		skilled, intermediate, home care, and mental health services as well as  		services for the mentally retarded.</p>
<p>Medicaid is a welfare-based system. Medicaid eligibles include the  		low-income aged, the blind, the disabled and those eligible for Aid to Families  		with Dependent Children (AFDC). States may also cover benefits for "medically  		needy" individuals and nursing home residents with incomes up to 300 percent of  		the Supplementary Security Income (SSI) payment level.</p>
<p>There has been some concern that Medicaid acts as a disincentive to the  		purchase of private protection. The issue has two related aspects: that because  		Medicaid is available, people will not give serious attention to long-term care  		insurance and other privately financed protection; and that people with  		resources will "game" the system by passing their assets along to others or  		protecting them in a trust, thus becoming eligible for Medicaid benefits.</p>
<p>A recent critique of these issues concludes that these concerns may be  		considerably overemphasized. The analysis presented in  		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/pfltce2.htm#relate">Chapter 4</a>  		of the report suggests that while incentives for people to alter their behavior  		to qualify for State-supported benefits do exist, it is not at all clear that  		significant numbers of people are responsive to such incentives.</p>
<p>First, the public's understanding of how long-term care is paid for and  		what coverage people actually have is very poor. A recent national survey of  		members of the American Association of Retired Persons revealed that 79 percent  		of those who expected at some point to have an extended nursing home stay,  		thought that Medicare would pay for all or part of this care. About one-third  		of those with private medigap insurance coverage incorrectly believed that  		their policies would cover extended nursing home care.</p>
<p>A second consideration in evaluating Medicaid's impact on private  		financing mechanisms is evidence that middle-class people are generally not  		disposed to rely on a welfare-based program for long-term care expenses. For  		example, a recent study by the National Center for Health Services Research of  		4,000 older persons in six states found that only 19 percent said they would  		not purchase long-term care insurance because they viewed Medicaid and other  		welfare coverage as adequate.</p>
<p>The degree to which the elderly are aware of and willing to use methods  		of circumventing Medicaid's asset restrictions is also unknown. However, asset  		protection requires considerable advance planning and an awareness of Medicaid  		eligibility rules and, in general, is both difficult and expensive to  		accomplish.</p>
<p>The considerations mentioned above suggest that Medicaid is not  		currently a significant barrier to private financing of long-term care.  		<b>However, this does not preclude the possibility that changes in Medicaid  		could have a positive impact on private financing mechanisms</b>. As a  		consequence the report describes, but takes no position on the merits of,  		several approaches which would make it more difficult for persons who can  		afford to pay for their own long-term care costs to become eligible for  		Medicaid. These proposals would:</p>
<ul><li>Severely restrict Medicaid eligibility to prevent persons from  		  qualifying for Medicaid benefits if they could once have afforded to provide  		  for long-term care insurance in a prior period;</li>
<li>Permit States to require spouses of Medicaid recipients to contribute  		  to the cost of their spouse's care;</li>
<li>Allow States greater flexibility in use of liens imposed on  		  recipients, property before death; and</li>
<li>Require States to restrict Medicaid eligibility of people with assets  		  sheltered in trusts.</li>
</ul><p>Another approach currently receiving some attention (but not advocated  		by the report) would waive Medicaid spend-down requirements for persons who  		financed their own care for a fixed period, e.g., one or two years. Medicaid  		would pay for the full costs after the consumer paid the front-end long-term  		care costs. The point of this would be to increase the marketability of private  		financing strategies such as insurance.</p>
<p>This approach would build on the fact that there is a significant effect  		on the affordability of insurance premiums when the period of coverage is  		limited. For example, a two year, $50 a day nursing home policy purchased at  		age 65 costs approximately $650 per year. A lifetime policy (no limit on  		nursing home coverage) purchased at the same age would cost about $1400.</p>
<p>One critical issue is whether the increased affordability of a limited  		nursing home policy, in combination with waiving spend-down, would expand  		participation under an insurance option enough to offset the drain on Medicaid.  		The intuitive answer is that it would not. The analyses done to date suggest  		that the people who would purchase long-term care insurance are not the people  		who end up on Medicaid. Therefore, picking up the Medicaid costs for everyone  		at the end of one or two years would end up increasing Medicaid costs over  		current projections. If one factors-in induced demand, the problem for Medicaid  		is worse.</p>
<p>Another major problem with this proposal is the issue of equity. Persons  		at higher income levels who could afford insurance would have their assets  		protected. Persons at lower income levels who could not afford insurance would  		lose everything. In essence, such a proposal would create a new Federal  		long-term care benefit, but only for those who are already well-off.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">CONCLUSIONS</h3>
<p>Federal, State and local governments pay almost half the costs of  		long-term care services received by older persons in the United States. Almost  		all the rest is paid directly by individuals or families who are largely  		unprotected by insurance or other types of mechanisms that shield the  		individual from catastrophic health expenses. It is evident that the vast  		majority of older Americans would greatly benefit if suitable and effective  		private financing mechanisms for long-term care were more widely available, at  		a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>This report has analyzed the feasibility and effectiveness of a broad  		range of private financing strategies which can assist persons in paying for  		long-term care. Of particular interest has been the extent to which these  		strategies can be expected to attract broad participation and help limit the  		out-of-pocket expenditures for individuals.</p>
<p>Clearly, the private financing strategies discussed in this report  		cannot solve all of the problems associated with catastrophic long-term care  		costs, especially for those at the low end of the income scale. There will  		continue to be a need, regardless of the potential of private solutions, for a  		public role in assisting people who need formal long-term care services and who  		cannot afford private means of protection. Further, there will continue to be a  		need to assist those individuals and families who, despite advance planning and  		private financial protection, encounter long-term care expenses that are well  		beyond ordinary means.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, private financing mechanisms can help a substantial number  		of individuals protect themselves and their families against the high costs of  		nursing home and other long-term care expenses. However, these options for  		private financing are neither well-developed nor widely known. This report is  		intended to serve as both a summary of what is presently known about the need  		for and costs of long-term care, as well as to promote a better understanding  		of the potential of private financing mechanisms and of how their use might be  		further developed.</p>
<p>The report has determined that the potential for expanding private  		financing mechanisms is significant and should be carefully nurtured. The  		analysis has demonstrated the <b>potential</b> of private mechanisms. However,  		the analysis also indicates that, while the economic status of the elderly is  		improving, one of the central problems in realizing the potential is the  		affordability of the private financing approaches.</p>
<p>The report also stresses that the great majority of elderly will not  		require <b>extended</b> nursing home stays during their lifetime. Those that  		do, encounter expenses that can easily deplete the savings of a lifetime. The  		challenge to private financing mechanisms is to bring the cost of protection  		within the means of a wider segment of the older population. This will enable  		the elderly to translate their resources into protection from financial  		ruin.</p>
<p>Analysis suggests that several of the options could provide protection  		to large numbers of the elderly, especially those in the middle and upper  		income ranges. Private long-term care insurance and combinations of insurance  		and other mechanisms show the greatest promise. In particular, insurance  		combined with alternate delivery approaches (e.g., CCRCs and SHMOs) and with  		supportive funding sources (e.g., IMAs and HECs), offer the opportunity to mass  		market insurance and to reduce concerns over adverse selection.</p>
<p>The report also indicates that, for the older persons who can afford the  		regular monthly fees, CCRCs provide an appealing alternative. Other mechanisms  		such as SHMOs are exciting in concept, but are just too new for analysts to  		assess with confidence.</p>
<p>Family and community-based care are the bulwark of the long-term care  		system. Even though most research suggests that the addition of home care does  		not significantly deter nursing home use, the informal care network should be  		encouraged and supported because it is humane and reflects what most of the  		elderly and their families desire.</p>
<p>The report suggests that volunteers represent an under-utilized resource  		for long-term care that could provide valuable services to elderly disabled and  		their families. Volunteerism is an important component of the Nation's public  		and private service system.</p>
<p>The report's focus on long-term care tends to isolate the discussion  		from the other essential components of care. In the judgement of many, the  		greatest potential for creating savings in total health care expenditures, as  		well as for fostering improvements in the appropriateness and satisfaction in  		care rendered, is in development of health systems which encourage a  		comprehensive approach to care. For this reason, special attention is drawn in  		the report to those private financing mechanisms which foster a comprehensive  		care approach.</p>
<p>Foremost in promoting the expansion of any of these mechanisms is the  		need for consumer education. This report has cited surveys which clearly  		demonstrate that older persons do not fully appreciate their vulnerability with  		respect to catastrophic nursing home care costs. They do not recognize that  		nursing home costs, hot hospital or physician costs, constitute the highest  		out-of-pocket expenditure for persons over age 65. Nor do older persons  		understand that neither Medicare nor private supplemental insurance offers much  		coverage in this regard. Once these facts are widely appreciated, then the  		opportunity for achieving the potential of any of the private financing  		approaches is significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>Governments can continue to assist the process through further research  		and development and by helping to educate the public as to both risks and  		options. Flexible regulatory policies and close collaboration among all levels  		of government and the private sector are also essential.</p>
<p>Private options are not certain to have a large impact in the immediate  		future. They are only now emerging, mostly on a trial basis, and they have not  		begun to touch the lives of most of the population at risk for having long-term  		care needs. Yet, their potential for expansion is significant and should be  		carefully nurtured.</p>
