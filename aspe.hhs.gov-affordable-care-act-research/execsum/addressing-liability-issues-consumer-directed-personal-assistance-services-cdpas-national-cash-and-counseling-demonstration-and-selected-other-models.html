<hr /><p></p>
<p> This report addresses the liability issues that may arise in  		government-sponsored consumer-directed personal assistance programs (CDPAS). In  		analyzing these issues, the report focuses on the programs implemented in  		Arkansas, Florida and New Jersey as part of the Cash and Counseling  		Demonstration, but also briefly addresses variations on the liability analysis  		for two well-established CDPAS programs, California's In-Home Supportive  		Services Program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program.  		The purpose of this report is twofold: first, to identify the circumstances in  		which negligence or other misconduct could result in liability and what persons  		or entities are likely to be liable; and second, to identify steps that can be  		taken to reduce exposure to such liability.</p>
<p> The methodology for this analysis involved review of all available  		program materials and operational procedures, relevant law and regulations,  		available literature and reports on the state programs,<sup><font size="-1"><a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note1">1</a></font></sup> and telephone interviews with several key  		contacts from the three Cash and Counseling programs and the California and New  		York programs. Legal research revealed that there are very few reported cases  		that discuss liability issues in the context of government sponsored  		consumer-directed care. Consequently, much of the legal analysis in this report  		is based on either the application of basic legal principles of tort law or  		analogies to comparable situations where appropriate. However, in the case of  		claims between workers and consumers, there is considerable case law that is  		directly analogous, in the context of both traditional agency care and  		privately employed care providers.</p>
<p> Although not identical, the Cash and Counseling programs in Arkansas,  		Florida and New Jersey share the following characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>All participants are Medicaid recipients who have been determined to  			 be eligible for specific numbers of hours of home care services, based on their  			 level of need or claims history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consumer's eligibility level for traditional Medicaid long term  			 care benefits is converted into a cash benefit amount or "allowance."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultants, who are private agencies or individuals with whom the  			 state has contracted, provide supportive services to consumers to help them  			 convert the cash allowance into a spending plan. Most of the consumer's  			 allowance typically is used to pay wages to CDPAS workers, but consumers have  			 the discretion to spend part of their allowance on a variety of goods and  			 services that enable them to function more independently, such as equipment and  			 home modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultants are also responsible for advising the consumer about  			 hiring, training and supervising personal assistance workers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the consumer is unable to or does not wish to assume the  			 responsibility of directing his or her own care, the consumer has the option of  			 designating an authorized representative. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to providing these supportive services from consultants,  			 the state contracts with one or more fiscal intermediary agencies that are  			 available to perform employer bookkeeping functions for the consumer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the spending plan has been completed and the workers hired,  			 consultants maintain regular contact with the consumer, and consultants and/or  			 fiscal agents periodically review consumer records to check for errors or  			 overspending. </p>
</li>
</ul><p> In this model of consumer-directed care, the state relinquishes  		considerable control over services to consumers. This raises the concern that  		in the absence of state control, there may be a decline in the quality of care  		and that: (1) poor care may result in injury to consumers; and (2) the state or  		its agents may be held responsible for the injury. However, the preliminary  		data from the Cash and Counseling Demonstration supports the conclusion that  		there is no increase in risk of injury to consumers under the consumer-directed  		model of care, compared to agency-provided care.<a href="addressing-liability-issues-consumer-directed-personal-assistance-services-cdpas-national-cash-and-counseling-demonstration-and-selected-other-models.html#note2"><sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup></a></p>
<p> Building on that conclusion, this analysis of liability risk (i.e., the  		risk of being held legally responsible for the injury suffered by another)  		finds that the risk of liability as between the consumer and the worker is no  		greater than that encountered under agency provided care. In addition, because  		in many cases family members serve as CDPAS workers under this model of care,  		there is, as a practical matter, less likelihood that the parties will seek  		compensation for personal injuries in the courts. </p>
<p> Putting aside any impact of familial relationships, personal assistance  		workers face a heightened theoretical risk of liability if they are negligent  		in performing caregiving duties, compared to agency provided care, because in  		the latter structure the agency shoulders the ultimate responsibility for  		injury under the doctrine of vicarious liability. Absent the agency, the  		individual worker employed by the consumer bears the sole legal responsibility  		for injuries caused by the worker's negligence. However, the practical  		likelihood of liability is influenced by the extent of assets or insurance  		owned by a prospective defendant. Individuals providing personal assistance are  		likely to have insignificant assets compared to agencies and in practical  		terms, are therefore likely to be "judgment proof." </p>
<p> In the case of injury to workers while on the job, liability risk is  		affected dramatically by the availability of workers' compensation. Where  		workers are <em>not</em> covered by workers' compensation benefits, consumers  		who have assets are more likely to be subject to suit for compensation if a  		worker is injured on the job, because of the absence of other remedies.  		Workers' compensation provides a relatively simple administrative remedy to  		injured workers and, at the same time, bars most personal injury actions by the  		worker against the consumer. </p>
<blockquote><p> With respect to other actors in the provision of services -- i.e.,  		  the state sponsoring agency, consultants, fiscal agents, public authorities (as  		  in California), or consumer-directed provider agencies (as in New York) -- this  		  analysis finds that their liability risk is limited to the specific tasks they  		  perform, with minimal risk of vicarious liability for personal injury  		  negligently caused by personal assistance workers. The risk of direct liability  		  is also relatively very low because of each actor's limited functions. Thus, in  		  general, delivering home care services through the Cash and Counseling model or  		  a similar consumer-directed structure results in a relatively low level of  		  liability risk where employer and support functions are "unbundled" in a  		  clearly defined and communicated fashion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Seeking to provide a broad taxonomy of all possible tort liability  		risks, this report identifies the following liability risks for each of the  		actors in consumer-directed care:</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Worker's Liability Risk </h2>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.A"> Section II.A</a> and  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a> discuss the following  		liability risks for workers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Negligent caregiving</strong>. Case law demonstrates that  			 individual workers face a significant risk that they may be found liable if  			 they are negligent in performing their caregiving duties, including leaving the  			 consumer unattended. However, if a worker's income and assets are low or  			 modest, as is the case for many in this field, the worker may, in practical  			 terms, be "judgment proof." From this perspective, the risk of enforceable  			 liability for negligent caregiving is a risk that is not likely to materialize  			 (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.A.1">Section II.A.1</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Negligence in non-caregiving matters</strong>. A worker may  			 be found liable for negligence in non-caregiving activities, most notably  			 creating a hazard in the consumer's home. However, here, again, if a worker  			 does not have sufficient income or assets to pay the judgment in a damage  			 action, this is a risk that is not likely to materialize (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.A.2">Section II.A.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A worker may be  			 a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective services (APS) law and  			 may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for failure to report abuse  			 or neglect that comes to attention of the worker. However, liability can easily  			 be avoided by complying with the APS law (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.A.3.a">Section II.A.3.a</a>). As a practical matter,  			 workers employed by the consumer or the consumer's representative, especially  			 if the worker is a family member, may have greater emotional or economic  			 barriers to reporting, compared to agency-employed workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for abuse or neglect</strong>. A worker may be  			 criminally liable under the state's APS law if the worker abuses or neglects  			 the consumer. This is a low level risk because of the infrequency of  			 encountering worker misconduct that rises to the level of abuse or neglect. Of  			 course, on the rare occasions when it does occur, the injury to the consumer  			 can be extremely serious (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.A.3.b">Section  			 II.A.3.b</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injury to third party caused by the  			 worker</strong>. The worker and the consumer are potentially liable for  			 injuries to third parties caused by the worker while acting within the scope of  			 employment. The worker's liability is direct, i.e., flowing directly from his  			 or her own action or inaction, while the consumer's risk of liability is  			 vicarious, arising from the employer-employee doctrine of <em>respondeat  			 superior</em>. Unless the worker and the consumer have sufficient income or  			 assets to pay the judgment in a damage action, this too is a risk that has a  			 low probability of materializing (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.C">Section  			 II.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injury to third party caused by  			 consumer</strong>. A third party may claim that an injury inflicted by a  			 consumer was caused by the negligent care or supervision of the worker, thus  			 making the worker liable for damages. However, such claims are rare and are  			 likely to be dismissed for failure to prove that the worker owed a duty of care  			 to the third party (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.C">Section  			 II.C</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>Consumer's Liability Risk </h2>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.B"> Section II.B</a> and  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a> discuss the following  		liability risks for consumers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Negligence in maintaining the workplace</strong>. Consumers  			 face a distinct risk of liability for on the job injuries to individual workers  			 they employ unless those employees are covered by workers' compensation. The  			 existence of workers' compensation coverage is a key protection for both  			 workers who risk injury and for consumers who, without it, face significant  			 liability risk. The case law demonstrates that a consumer may be found liable  			 for negligence in maintaining the workplace -- that is, for creating or failing  			 to correct hazardous conditions in the consumer's home. If the consumer lives  			 with a family member or friend who is the owner or renter of the consumer's  			 home, that family member or friend may also be liable on a theory of premises  			 liability (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.B.1">Section II.B.1</a>). It is true  			 that the consumer could be liable for injury caused to any person invited into  			 his or her home on these same legal grounds. However, the frequency and level  			 of involvement of a personal assistance services worker in the home raise the  			 risk to a substantially higher level, although no higher than is faced with  			 agency-provided services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Injuries caused by the consumer's mental  			 impairment</strong>. Cases in which consumers with mental impairments engage in  			 negligent or aggressive behavior that causes injury to the worker are more  			 complicated, because state law varies on whether the consumer's mental  			 impairment will be recognized as a defense in an action for damages. The trend  			 is to recognize the defense when asserted by a defendant who is confined to a  			 residential facility, and there is case law suggesting that in at least some  			 circumstances, this defense will also be accepted in the home care setting (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.B.2">Section II.B.2</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrongful discharge and other employment-related  			 claims</strong>. As an employer, the consumer is potentially liable for a  			 variety of employment related claims, such as discharge in violation of an  			 employment agreement or employment actions that are discriminatorily motivated.  			 However, this is a low frequency risk, and consumers can be protected from  			 liability by a carefully worded employment agreement and by being made aware of  			 any applicable state employment laws (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.B.3">Section II.B.3</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for injuries to third parties caused by the  			 workers</strong>. Consumers may be liable as employers on the basis of  			 vicarious liability (also referred to as <em>respondeat superior</em>) for  			 injuries caused to third parties by their workers while acting within the scope  			 of employment. For example, an auto accident caused by the worker while running  			 an errand for the consumer could result in such liability (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.C">Section II.C</a>). </p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>Authorized Representative's Liability Risk </h2>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a> discusses the  		following liability risks for authorized representatives:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligence and for breach of fiduciary  			 duty</strong>. In addition to potential liability for negligence (that is,  			 failure to exercise ordinary care) in performing the duties of an authorized  			 representative, an authorized representative may well have a heightened  			 "fiduciary duty" to the consumer. However, in most cases authorized  			 representatives are relatives or friends whose caregiving commitment is high,  			 as is their level of care in performing their duties, thus significantly  			 reducing the likelihood of negligence or breach of fiduciary duty (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent hiring of a worker</strong>. The  			 parent or other legally responsible person who is acting as the consumer's  			 authorized representative may be liable for injuries or damage that results  			 from a worker's failure to properly supervise or care for the consumer.  			 However, case law on negligent hiring and parental liability strongly suggests  			 that the authorized representative would be liable only if the representative:  			 (1) knew or had reason to know that the consumer was likely to cause such  			 damage or injuries; and (2) the authorized representative was negligent in  			 hiring the personal assistant responsible for the supervision or care of the  			 consumer (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability as the employer of the worker</strong>. The  			 authorized representative normally will be considered the joint employer, or  			 the sole employer of the worker if the consumer has no ability to self direct  			 his or her care, and therefore will have potential employment related liability  			 (see <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.B.3">Section II.B.3</a>), including  			 vicarious liability for torts committed by the worker that cause injury to  			 third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for abuse, neglect or exploitation of the  			 consumer</strong>. In states that provide for a civil cause of action for abuse  			 of a vulnerable adult, the representative may be liable to the consumer if the  			 representative abuses, neglects or exploits the consumer. The representative  			 could also be criminally liable. Again, this is a very low-incidence risk.  			 Finally, the representative may be a mandatory reporter under the state APS law  			 (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionII.D">Section II.D</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>Fiscal Agent's Liability Risk </h2>
<p> Because the role of the fiscal agent is limited (processing payroll  		records and issuing paychecks, and, in some cases, fiscal monitoring), the  		liability risks for fiscal agents are correspondingly quite limited. The report  		does not address the various contractual obligations to the state that the  		fiscal agent may incur. The report does analyze the following personal injury  		liability risks for fiscal agents in <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIII">Section  		III</a>: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability to consumers for breach of contract</strong>. In  			 some states, the fiscal agent (FA) enters into an agreement directly with the  			 consumer, creating the possibility of a breach of contract action by the  			 consumer if the FA fails to issue a paycheck to the worker and the consumer, as  			 a result, loses the worker's services and suffers injury. However, the possible  			 theories of liability are speculative and difficult to prove, and even if the  			 plaintiff is nonetheless successful, the amount of damages a consumer or worker  			 will be able to recover is likely to be insignificant (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIII.A">Section III.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tort liability to consumers and workers for failure to pay  			 worker</strong>. Negligence resulting in failure to pay the worker could also  			 give rise to a tort action by the worker or the consumer against the FA. Here,  			 too, there are serious legal obstacles to these claims, such as the difficulty  			 of proving causation, and in any case, the amount of damages at stake is likely  			 to be insignificant (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIII.B">Section  			 III.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability to consumers for negligent monitoring</strong>. A  			 fiscal agent's negligence in monitoring a consumer's expenses and detecting  			 problems could result in negative consequences for the consumer such as  			 dis-enrollment from the CDPAS program, but here again there are serious legal  			 obstacles to recovery, most notably the consumer's contributory negligence in  			 deviating from the spending plan (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIII.C">Section  			 III.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A  			 fiscal agent may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective  			 services (APS) law and may therefore be both civilly and criminally liable for  			 failure to report abuse, neglect, or exploitation that comes to attention of  			 the FA. Liability can easily be avoided by complying with any applicable APS  			 reporting requirements (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIII.D">Section  			 III.D</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>Consultant's Liability Risk </h2>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, consultants, rather than the  		state, are assigned the most critical program functions -- assisting the  		consumer in designating an authorized representative and developing the  		spending plan and the back-up plan; providing consultation with regard to  		hiring, training and supervising workers; and monitoring program quality and  		initiating action to correct problems. While the fact that the consultant's  		functions are so critical certainly creates a significant risk of liability,  		this risk is mitigated by the fact the consumer explicitly bears primary  		responsibility for decisions regarding development of the spending plan and the  		back-up plan and selection and supervision of a worker, including  		hiring/firing, training, and scheduling. This separation of responsibility  		should protect the consultant from being deemed vicariously liable for injury  		to consumers caused by workers or by deficiencies in the spending plan or  		back-up plan. The way the program defines the functions of the consultant (or  		case worker by any other name) is critical to the liability risk analysis, for  		liability risk follows function.</p>
<p> Consultants can effectively protect themselves against liability by:  		(1) being very clear in practice about staying within the bounds of  		consultation versus case management; (2) complying with program procedures and  		instructions carefully and executing all responsibilities conscientiously and  		with reasonable care; and (3) making it clear all times that it is the role of  		the consumer, not the consultant, to make decisions regarding the consumer's  		care.</p>
<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIV"> Section IV</a> discusses the following  		liability risks for consultants:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent designation of an authorized  			 representative</strong>. To the extent that the consultant takes on  			 responsibility for screening and/or approving an authorized representative, the  			 consultant may be liable to the consumer for negligence in investigating,  			 evaluating, or approving that selection, if the representative subsequently is  			 negligent in performing his or her responsibilities or otherwise fails to act  			 in the consumer's best interest (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIV.A">Section  			 IV.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent assistance in the development of the  			 spending plan and back-up plan</strong>. If the consultant provides inadequate  			 or incorrect advice, the consultant may be liable for negligent assistance in  			 the development of the spending plan or back-up plan. In states that give  			 consultants authority to approve the spending plan and/or the back-up plan, the  			 consultant may be liable for negligent approval of a deficient plan (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIV.B">Section IV.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent assistance in hiring, training and  			 supervising workers</strong>. Similarly, if the consultant provides inadequate  			 or incorrect advice regarding hiring, training or supervising workers, the  			 consultant may be liable for negligence if the consumer who relies on that  			 advice is subsequently injured (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIV.C">Section  			 IV.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent monitoring</strong>. A consultant  			 may be liable if the consultant is negligent in monitoring program quality or  			 fails to initiate action to correct problems identified in the course of  			 monitoring, resulting in injury to the consumer (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIV.D">Section IV.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to report abuse or neglect</strong>. A  			 consultant may be a mandatory reporter under the state's adult protective  			 services (APS) law and may therefore face civil and/or criminal liability for  			 failure to report abuse or neglect that comes to attention of the consultant  			 (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionIV.E">Section IV.E</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>State's Liability Risk </h2>
<p> In the Cash and Counseling model of CDPAS, the state's risk of  		liability for personal injury is greatly reduced. Most of the functions that  		were performed by the state or a provider agency in traditional Medicaid-funded  		home care services are now unbundled and performed by consumers (e.g., hiring  		and supervising workers), consultants (e.g., advising consumers and monitoring  		care), and fiscal agents (e.g., payroll services for workers). The core  		functions that continue to be performed by the state, such as enrolling  		consumers and responding to serious problems in connection with consumer care,  		carry some risk of liability, but if the state program is well structured and  		operated in accordance with that structure, this risk is minimal.</p>
<p> <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV">Section V</a> discusses the following  		liability risks for states:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to obtain adequate consent</strong>.  			 State programs that elect not to screen applicants to determine whether the  			 applicant is an appropriate candidate for CDPAS risk liability if the state  			 enrolls a consumer without first obtaining the consumer's voluntary agreement  			 to participate in the program (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.A">Section  			 V.A</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to adopt adequate criteria and  			 procedures for selection of an authorized representative for consumers who lack  			 the capacity to designate a representative</strong>. The relatively informal  			 criteria and procedures for selection of an authorized representative that are  			 now in effect in the Cash and Counseling states create the risk that the state  			 may be liable if a representative mismanages a consumer's care, particularly  			 the care of a consumer who lacks the capacity to designate a representative (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.B">Section V.B</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for negligent response to a problem or complaint  			 regarding consumer's care</strong>. The state may be liable if it fails to  			 exercise ordinary care in responding to a problem or complaint regarding a  			 consumer's care However, this liability risk is no different from that faced in  			 agency-provided care (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.C">Section  			 V.C</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability as alleged employer of the individual  			 worker</strong>. If the state is found to be the employer of the individual  			 worker, the state will be vicariously liable for torts committed by that person  			 while acting within the scope of employment and for workers' compensation if  			 the worker is injured on the job. However, in the Cash and Counseling model,  			 where the consumer, and not the state (or fiscal agent), controls the key  			 employer functions (hiring/firing, assigning and scheduling tasks, training,  			 and supervision), the risk of such liability is negligible (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.D">Section V.D</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vicarious liability for consultant's or fiscal agent's  			 negligence and other tortious conduct</strong>. Even though the state  			 identifies an individual who provides consultant or fiscal agent services as an  			 independent contractor, if the state exercises sufficient control over the  			 independent contractor, the state can nevertheless be found to be the employer  			 of that contractor and will be vicariously liable for the contractor's  			 negligence and other tortious conduct. In the Cash and Counseling model, the  			 state typically does not exercise such control (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.E">Section V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability based on nondelegable duty</strong>. The state  			 will be liable if a tortious act is committed by the consultant or the fiscal  			 agent while carrying out a "nondelegable duty" of the state. The concept of  			 "nondelegable duty" has been used in those cases where a court concludes that  			 as a matter of policy, the government should be responsible for the torts of  			 independent contractors who are carrying out the work of or executing a  			 responsibility of the government. However, courts vary in how they approach  			 this issue, and the content of statutes or regulations setting forth the  			 state's responsibilities in connection with CDPAS is likely to determine  			 whether a nondelegable duty exists (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.E">Section  			 V.E</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to provide effective emergency back-up  			 care</strong>. The Cash and Counseling Demonstration states required consumers  			 to develop back-up strategies as part of the planning process, but if the state  			 takes on a system-wide role in securing or providing emergency back-up, the  			 state will take on significantly greater risk of liability for failure of  			 back-up care, depending upon the level of responsibility and function assumed.  			 For example, under the current federal Independence Plus Medicaid waiver  			 templates for consumer-directed personal assistance programs, the state is  			 required to "assure" emergency backup care for consumers. Undertaking a  			 responsibility to "assure" emergency back-up brings with it a high level of  			 liability risk if the state's emergency backup system fails and the consumer  			 suffers injury as a result. (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionV.F">Section  			 V.F</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p> CDPAS programs can be structured in many ways, and it is beyond the  		scope of this report to identify and analyze the liability issues associated  		with each of the variations on CDPAS. However, <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionVI">Section VI</a> of the report does address two  		well-established CDPAS programs, California's In-Home Supportive Services  		(IHSS) Program and New York's Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Program  		(CDPAP). There are several significantly different liability issues that may  		arise in the California IHSS program:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The liability risks for counties and state agencies involved in IHSS  			 are small because they have been given broad statutory immunity. However, the  			 state does assume the responsibility of covering all workers with workers'  			 compensation protection (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionVI.A.2">Section  			 VI.A.2</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public authorities in each county act as the employer of IHSS  			 workers for purposes of collective bargaining, but the public authorities have  			 been granted statutory immunity which shields them from vicarious liability  			 arising out of the consumer-worker relationship (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionVI.A.3">Section VI.A.3</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public authorities also perform certain other designated  			 functions, such as: screening and referral of workers through employment  			 registries; providing training; providing emergency back-up support; and  			 monitoring services. The immunity provision for public authorities, unlike that  			 for the state and counties, does not extend to functions such as these that a  			 public authority carries out directly. Therefore, liability risk follows and is  			 proportional to the breadth and depth of the specific function undertaken by  			 the public authority (<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionVI.A.3">Section  			 VI.A.3</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The New York CDPAP program is structured around a provider agency,  		Concepts of Independence, Inc., that serves as the employer of record of the  		workers for purposes of employee payroll and benefits functions and for  		purposes of entering into a Medicaid provider agreement with the state. At the  		same time, the consumer retains responsibility for directing his or her care  		and services to substantially the same extent as is done in the Cash and  		Counseling model. Accordingly, the liability issues are substantially similar  		in the two models, except that all workers are mandatorily covered by workers'  		compensation through Concepts, the provider agency.</p>
<p> <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/cdliab.htm#sectionVII">Section VII</a>, Conclusions and  		Options to Address Liability Risk, reiterates the conclusions reached in  		Sections II through VI. This section also sets forth an array of steps CDPAS  		program administrators may want to consider to address the liability risks for  		each actor in consumer-directed care. The steps include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Options to Address the Worker's Liability Risks</strong></p>
<ul><li>Fully inform the worker of the liability risks and document the  				process.</li>

<li>Check applicability of the state APS law.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Options to Address the Consultant's Liability  			 Risks</strong></p>
<ul><li>Implement a quality management plan.</li>

<ul><li>Institute procedures to obtain the consumer's informed and  				voluntary agreement to participate in the program.</li>
<li>Consider adopting more formal criteria and procedures for the  				designation of an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Adopt a quality management plan in connection with consultant  				monitoring and the state's response to problems that are reported by  				consultants.</li>
<li>Avoid vicarious liability as the employer of workers by following  				the Cash and Counseling model.</li>
<li>Minimize the risk of vicarious liability for the torts of  				consultants and fiscal agents by avoiding indicia of an employment  				relationship.</li>
<li>Take care to avoid assumption of additional potential liability  				risks when drafting regulations, rules and protocols relating to CDPAS.</li>
<li>Negotiate an indemnity clause in contracts with consultants and  				fiscal agents.</li>
<li>Enact legislation limiting liability in connection with  				CDPAS.</li>
</ul></li>
