<hr /><p></p>
<p>Over the past two decades, state and federal long-term care spending on  		home and community services has increased, primarily through Medicaid waiver  		programs. Most of the research and policy literature on home and community  		services for elderly persons has focused on home care and residential care,  		including adult foster care and assisted living. Little attention has been paid  		to adult day services (ADS)--a nonresidential community service provided  		outside the home. Three major adult day services models are generally  		recognized: a social model; a health or medical model, which is sometimes  		combined with the social model; and a specialized model. This report will refer  		to all models generically as ADS.</p>
<p>The first ADS program was a geriatric day hospital program established  		in 1960 in Greensboro, North Carolina. The program evolved to become a  		community service to meet caregivers need for respite in order to work,  		fulfill other obligations, and recover from the demands of continuous care.  		Many caregivers who use ADS are providing care to family members with dementia  		who need constant supervision to assure their safety.</p>
<p>The social model of ADS provides a secure environment, assistance with  		some activities of daily living (ADLs), and therapeutic activities aimed at  		helping participants to achieve optimal physical and mental functioning. In the  		health or medical model, ADS programs also provide skilled nursing and  		rehabilitation services and many programs combine both models. Specialized  		models are targeted to specific groups, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS,  		multiple sclerosis, acquired brain injuries, or mental illness. Most ADS  		programs serve a large proportion of participants with some degree of cognitive  		impairment, but some programs specialize in the care of individuals with  		dementia.</p>
<p>ADS programs are of interest to states because of their potential to  		delay or prevent nursing home placement, in large part by supporting informal  		caregiving. Informal caregivers are the backbone of the nations long-term  		care system. Over seven million Americans provide 120 million hours of care to  		about 4.2 million elderly persons with functional limitations each week. The  		estimated economic value of this care ranges from $45-$96 billion a year.  		Research has found that caregivers who experience stress and burden are more  		likely to institutionalize relatives suffering from dementia. Once the physical  		resources of caregivers decline and other home and community resources (paid or  		unpaid) are unavailable, nursing home placement is more likely.</p>
<p>States are also interested in the potential of ADS to reduce health care  		costs by providing health monitoring, preventive health care, and timely  		provision of primary care, particularly for individuals at risk for incurring  		high medical costs. These include elderly individuals who are dually eligible  		for Medicare and Medicaid--called dual eligibles--who comprised 18 percent of  		all Medicare beneficiaries in 2000 but accounted for 24 percent of total  		Medicare spending. Similarly, in 2002, they represented 16 percent of all  		Medicaid enrollees but 42 percent of program spending.</p>
<p>All states fund some form of ADS through either their Medicaid state  		plan or a waiver program, and in fiscal year 2005, Congress funded a Medicare  		demonstration of the provision of home health benefits in ADS programs.</p>
<p>However, little is known about the provision, use, or outcomes of ADS,  		particularly the medical model, and the ADS industrys capacity to provide  		health services. Research has been hampered by the considerable variation in  		the characteristics of ADS programs both within and across states, and by a  		lack of data.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Purpose of Study</h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to inform policymakers about  		the current and potential role of ADS in the health care and long-term care  		systems as determined by state regulation; (2) to identify operational and  		regulatory issues facing ADS providers under different ADS models and in  		different regulatory and financing environments; and (3) to provide information  		that can guide future research and policy analysis on ADS for elderly persons  		generally and on medically-oriented ADS specifically.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Methodology</h3>
<p>The study used several qualitative research methods, including: (1) an  		in-depth review of state approaches to regulating ADS; (2) consultation with a  		Technical Advisory Group, subject experts, state regulatory and Medicaid staff,  		and state provider associations; and (3) site visits to ADS providers in five  		states: Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, and Washington. See  		<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/execsum/keyADS.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a> for detailed information about the  		methods employed.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Regulatory Findings</h3>
<p>States vary in their regulatory approaches. Half of the states license  		ADS providers, ten states certify them, four states require licensure for one  		ADS model and certification for another, and 13 states use some other type of  		regulation, such as contractual requirements for providers receiving public  		funding. The majority of states require inspections that often coincide with  		initial or annual certification or license renewal, and several stipulate that  		unannounced visits can be performed at any time. Providers of Medicaid-funded  		ADS must meet applicable state licensing and regulatory requirements and in  		over half of the states, must meet additional Medicaid requirements.</p>
<p>Most states regulate ADS to allow the provision of medical services.  		They provide general parameters for who may or may not be served but do not  		specify admission and discharge criteria. For example, they lack specific  		provisions regarding the types or level of functional or health needs that  		should prevent admission or trigger discharge.</p>
<p><b><i>Required and Optional Services</i></b></p>
<p>In most states, parameters regarding who can be served are determined  		indirectly through provisions regarding mandatory and optional services that  		indicate the level-of-care participants may receive. ADS providers are  		generally required to furnish assistance with ADLs and health monitoring.  		States that regulate adult day health care as distinct from adult day care  		require the former to furnish additional services, including skilled nursing  		services, medication administration, and physical, occupational, or  		speech/language therapy.</p>
<p>The majority of states require licensed personnel to administer  		medications. Some states permit unlicensed staff to so under nurse delegation  		provisions. Most states require written policies for medication management and  		administration and many have requirements related to self-administration of  		medications.</p>
<p><b><i>Staffing Requirements</i></b></p>
<p>Most states specify minimum mandatory staff-to-participant ratios.  		Nearly two-thirds require one staff person to every six or eight participants.  		The highest ratio is one staff person for every four participants and the  		lowest ratio is one staff person for every ten participants. Some states  		require different ratios for different types of ADS programs and/or specific  		types of participants, for example, those with dementia and those with  		extensive needs. Required staffing ratios for persons with dementia are  		generally 1:4, but Michigan requires 1:3. Several states do not have minimum  		staff-to-participant ratios and allow providers to determine the number of  		staff based on their own assessment of the number necessary to meet  		participants needs.</p>
<p>Virtually all states require specific types of staff for ADS programs,  		for example, a program, director, activities director and a nurse. Requirements  		for nurses vary from part-time to full-time, and whether they must be  		available or on-site at all times. Because most states require  		staffing consistent with participants needs, licensed nurses are always  		required if ADS providers are mandated to furnish skilled nursing services.</p>
<p><b><i>Training Requirements</i></b></p>
<p>Nearly all states have orientation, initial, and ongoing training  		requirements, but they are minimal. Some states requirements are general,  		while others specify the content of training and the number of hours required.  		Most states require at least one staff trained in first aid and CPR to be on  		duty at all times. About half of the states have special training requirements  		for staff who serve individuals with dementia.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Site Visit Findings</h3>
<p>The ADS providers we visited are providing both health and long-term  		care services to impaired older persons, a high proportion of whom are unable  		to live alone. Informal care supplemented by ADS is enabling them to remain in  		their homes. The age range in the programs is 21 through 90-plus, but with the  		exception of the program serving persons with HIV/AIDS, all served a primarily  		elderly population.</p>
<p>Whether an ADS program serves younger adults--including those with  		mental retardation and other developmental disabilities and those with acquired  		brain injuries--depends on a combination of regulatory requirements and funding  		streams for these population.</p>
<p>The majority of program participants have extensive functional  		limitations, due to physical or mental impairments or a combination of both.  		Providers estimate that about 50-80 percent of older participants have  		cognitive impairment--with or without a diagnosis of dementia. Many have  		chronic health conditions requiring daily health monitoring and skilled nursing  		services. The licensed nurses employed by these ADS providers provide  		preventive and primary health care and coordinate this care with  		participants primary care physicians.</p>
<p>Most providers felt that participants functional and nursing needs  		have increased over the past few years and several providers felt that it was  		due to the increasing recognition of ADS as a viable alternative to nursing  		home and assisted living placement. Providers reported that they try to serve  		everyone who needs assistance, but the number of people with severe needs who  		can be served (e.g., individuals who need two persons to assist with toileting)  		is limited by the number of staff available.</p>
<p><b><i>Services Provided</i></b></p>
<p>Providers identified ADL assistance and medication administration as the  		most frequently provided services. Programs operating as combined or  		health/medical models also provided health monitoring, health education, and  		skilled nursing services.</p>
<p>Providers believe that their goals are to enable participants to remain  		in their homes as long as possible, and to maximize participants  		cognitive and physical functioning, both maintaining function and restoring  		function lost due to social isolation and lack of stimulation. Many providers  		said that the ability to simultaneously offer different types of programming  		according to functional level was essential to ensuring optimal  		functioning.</p>
<p><b><i>Operational and Policy Issues</i></b></p>
<p>None of the ADS providers could meet their costs solely through private  		payments and public program reimbursement. Nearly all of the providers receive  		a significant percentage of their operating revenue from Medicaid and other  		public funding sources and all said that the reimbursement rate did not cover  		their costs. Several programs use part-time, flex-time, and on-call staff so  		they do not have to carry staff overhead when the census is low.</p>
<p>Some providers set their private pay rate higher than cost to subsidize  		the lower than cost reimbursement from public programs. Several programs depend  		on a significant amount of in-kind contributions and volunteers, and many  		programs rely on subsidies from parent organizations and charitable  		organizations during budget shortfalls. To assure a daily census that will meet  		operating costs, providers have to continually market their services, and some  		have had to allocate a substantial amount of their budget to do so.</p>
<p>Because some states require ADS providers to furnish transportation and  		others do not, transportation issues varied among the states. Whether or not  		they were required to provide transportation, and apart from funding concerns,  		virtually all providers said that participants transportation needs posed  		a major logistical challenge and took up a great deal of staff time.</p>
<p>Several programs reported high retention rates for certified nursing  		assistants and other staff such as activity directors; others reported high  		turnover. Those that reported difficulty recruiting did so for professional  		staff--registered nurses (RNs) and rehabilitation therapists--noting that  		professional staff can earn more in other health care and long-term care  		settings.</p>
<p>For staff members who stay, providers attribute their retention to: (1)  		the work environment, which is less demanding than other long-term care  		settings; (2) higher staff-to-participant ratios than are found in assisted  		living and nursing facilities; (3) staff who value their role in a program that  		has a mission to serve the community; and (4) longstanding relationships with  		participants.</p>
<p><b><i>Regulatory Issues</i></b></p>
<p>Providers said that compared to other long-term care settings, ADS  		regulations set ideal rather than minimum standards. Providers felt that most  		state requirements regarding staffing and training were necessary to provide  		good care. They objected to requirements that they believed increased costs  		without increasing the quality of care, such as having to document staff  		arrival and departure times and some physical plant requirements. Providers  		noted other regulatory issues unique to their states.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">Conclusions and Research Recommendations</h3>
<p>Based on our study findings, we have drawn several conclusions.</p>
<p><b><i>Regulation</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The method states use to regulate ADS varies considerably, as does  			 the content of the regulations. However, states generally distinguish between  			 ADS and adult day health services, and have more extensive requirements for the  			 health model. In general, staffing requirements are more stringent than those  			 for residential care settings, particularly requirements for licensed nurse  			 staffing in adult day health programs and programs that combine a social and  			 medical model of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some states, regulations appear to limit providers  			 flexibility to provide services that meet caregivers needs, such as  			 arbitrary restrictions on the number of service hours that may be provided on  			 weekends. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is likely that the considerable state variation in regulatory  			 approaches will continue in the near future. In states without licensure,  			 providers disagree about whether the industry should be licensed. One argument  			 for doing so is that long-term care insurers will not reimburse ADS unless they  			 are furnished by licensed entities. Providers in Washington noted this  			 difficulty but those in Illinois did not.</p>
<p>Some providers would support licensure if it led to an increase in  			 reimbursement rates and others believe it would aid in their marketing efforts  			 to recruit private pay participants. However, in states that do not license ADS  			 providers, some fear that licensing would be added to Medicaid requirements  			 rather than replacing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adult day health services are part of the continuum of both health  			 and long-term care services. In the states we visited, ADS providers are  			 furnishing preventive care, health monitoring, and skilled nursing services to  			 individuals with chronic illnesses and physical and cognitive impairments. Some  			 providers are also serving adults under age 65, depending on regulatory  			 requirements and the funding streams for this population.</p>
<p>Because ADS providers must meet Medicaid state plan or waiver  			 contracting requirements to furnish services to Medicaid beneficiaries--either  			 in addition to or in lieu of state licensing or certification  			 requirements--they are regulated at a level which allows them to furnish  			 health-related and medical services as well as long-term care services to  			 elderly persons with a high level of nursing and medical needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Program Models</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The number of purely social ADS programs may decrease as more  			 providers offer combined or health/medical models. Social programs appear to be  			 at a disadvantage because many participants disenroll as they age and their  			 health and functional needs increase. A combined program offering both a social  			 and medical model appears to be the most financially viable.</p>
<p>The literature on caregiver stress has pointed out the need to use a  			 social model of ADS when people are not so impaired, to help prevent  			 burnout, and many providers noted a need for this model. Others  			 point out that specialized social programs are essential for individuals with  			 dementia who do not have ADL impairments and medical needs. However, these  			 programs may not survive due to: (1) the pressure to serve large numbers in  			 order to meet fixed overhead costs and regulatory requirements, and (2) the  			 need to meet the health and functional needs of increasingly older and more  			 impaired participants, particularly if they want to be Medicaid  			 providers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Funding and Reimbursement </i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>A unique feature of ADS relative to nursing homes and residential  			 care settings is their reliance on multiple funding sources to cover operating  			 costs. While Medicaid is the primary public funding source for ADS providers  			 through either a waiver program or the state plan, in the five states we  			 visited reimbursement rates were not sufficient to meet costs. To remain  			 financially viable and serve nonMedicaid eligibles who cannot afford to pay for  			 some or all of the services they need, ADS programs must find other sources of  			 funding.</p>
<p>Other funding sources include state and local program funds,  			 Veterans Administration funds, the Social Services Block Grant, Older Americans  			 Act funds, private payments--both out-of-pocket and from long-term care  			 insurance, contributions from local service agencies such as United Way, and  			 charitable contributions obtained through significant and ongoing fundraising  			 efforts. Every ADS program we visited also relied extensively on in-kind  			 contributions and numerous volunteers. The combination of funding sources, each  			 with its own rules, greatly complicates the administration of ADS and can limit  			 providers flexibility to meet consumers needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States that pay flat rates create a disincentive for providers to  			 admit participants with severe impairments. Some states pay either hourly rates  			 or have tiered rates for different levels of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of ADS is relatively inexpensive compared to home care.  			 Agencies charge as much as $20-$25 for an hours visit by a home health  			 aide and $85 or more for a half-hour visit by an RN. The national average daily  			 cost for the social model of ADS is about $54, for the medical model about $59,  			 and for the combined model about $57.</p>
<p>In the five states we visited, some providers furnished only the  			 minimum number of hours required by public programs to receive the daily  			 rate--never fewer than four. In other states, providers furnished up to 11  			 hours a day on the daily rate. Despite the relatively low cost of ADS, the five  			 states we visited do not appear to be interested in expanding the availability  			 of ADS generally--or medically-oriented ADS specifically.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Operational Issues</i></b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Lack of transportation and the high cost of transportation are major  			 impediments to the use of ADS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without greater public recognition of the role ADS can play in  			 maintaining adults of all ages with disabilities in home and community  			 settings, it is unlikely that ADS programs will see an increase in private pay  			 participants.</p>
<p>Although some providers and experts feel that public knowledge about  			 ADS has improved, all acknowledge that it lags far behind public knowledge and  			 understanding of other long-term care options. Even though ADS allow  			 significantly impaired nursing home-eligible participants to remain at home or  			 living with family, providers believe that the public still thinks that ADS are  			 the adult equivalent of child care. This perception would appear to be  			 widespread, as evidenced by a 2002 article in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>  			 titled When Your Parents Need a Baby-Sitter: Adult Day Care Centers in  			 Short Supply.</p>
<p>Other erroneous perceptions are that ADS are only for the poor, only  			 for the rich, only for old people, or only for people with  			 dementia. To alter these perceptions, the industry may need to engage in public  			 education efforts. While the national ADS association supports a change in the  			 name from adult day care to ADS, providers need to use the terms that public  			 programs use in order to qualify for funding.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3 align="CENTER">Recommendations for Future Research and Policy  		Analysis</h3>
<p>Based on anecdotal evidence from providers and families, ADS enable  		informal caregivers to continue providing care in the home, thereby delaying or  		preventing institutionalization.  More research is needed to document the  		long-term care cost-savings of these programs. Such research could guide state  		policymakers who have to carefully target expansions of home and community  		services to assure the cost-effectiveness of limited resources.</p>
<p>ADS also appear to offer a means to reduce health expenditures.  		Washingtons Medicaid agency is conducting a study examining clinical  		outcomes and medical expenditures for adult day health participants who reside  		in adult family homes. While the final results of this two-year study are not  		yet available, preliminary analysis has demonstrated overall cost-savings.  		Given the potential for health care cost-savings, particularly as the  		population ages, other states may want to consider analyzing Medicaid data to  		determine the cost-effectiveness of ADS.</p>
<p>Such research would provide much-needed documentation to determine  		whether an expansion of ADS that provide health services is warranted.</p>
