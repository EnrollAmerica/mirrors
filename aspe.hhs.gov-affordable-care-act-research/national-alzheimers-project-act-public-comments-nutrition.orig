<p>At the last meeting I was so excited waiting to hear how much money the NIH was going to recommend to Congress for research into treatment for dementia. I was then so very disappointed when they asked for just 326 million dollars be added to the budget. Why so little in comparison to what they did for cancer or HIV, and with the counsel's recommendation of 2 billion dollars? Others agreed with the 2 billion dollar figure, which is why it is so surprising. After everyone has tried so hard, and we finally get the opportunity of a lifetime, we are let down by NIH. If I understand it correctly, part of the reason seemed to be that they would not be able to deal with it if they had more money coming in. It is my hope that the council will send their own record to the congress and let them know how this recommendation is wrong and that it should be much higher.</p>
<p>On a side note, 2 billion is not even enough. What about the people here today? Why are there no advertising campaigns for dementia awareness yet? Some of you think I am too critical of you, and I have paid dearly for that, but please don't you think we should have some sort of dementia awareness campaign?</p>
<p>I have mentioned this before. I once had access to being able to call in, but the new administration has decided that it is not possible. Some of theCounsel members even recommended this should be addressed as the technology available today makes it very simple. I want to make it happen. When I reached out to the ADA they said a government agency must provide reasonable accommodations for a person like me. If I can no longer write or have problems driving, reasonable accommodations must be made. When they were all ready to help reinforce this, I was told they could not because it was HHS. They said they could help with any other government agency but not HHS. I am starting to wonder why things are different for HHS alone. HHS can take the lead here. Sending in an email is not the same as me being able to verbalize what I want to say. An email sent in advance also fails to capture what happens just before and during the meeting. Please reconsider your decision as I would like to be able to call in for our next meeting.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to be here again after having been banned from the last meeting. In life I have always tried to learn from my mistakes. While I heard you loud and clear on your expectations, I don't believe you fully understand what can be expected from people with dementia. If you are going to write policies and procedures on this issue, then you must clearly understand what this disease will do to people like me. We do lose our filters and say the wrong things at times. We also will do strange things in public that we would never have done when our brains were fully functioning. If you are going to educate the rest of the world then it is important for you to understand it first. Only then can you shed light on these issues and encourage others on how best to deal with us without trying to remove us from society. Please don't create more negative stigma, and don't make us feel worse because you don't understand how horrible this disease can be.</p>
<p>Before all this happened I was doing really great in my advocacy and knew what I needed to do each day. This action had a huge impact on me. I went from having a purpose to being completely derailed. I don't even know how to explain it, but I just cannot seem to get back on track to do what I once did best. I had reinvented myself to have a new purpose in life, which was not easy. While I cannot prove it, I do believe this incident has led to a much faster decline in the course of my disease. It is so important to realize this as your actions could have significant impact when dealing with those with dementia. I have lost my purpose and just can't seem to get back to where I was.</p>
<p>I belong to many groups, and I would like to share one post I recently read. It is called "Desperately Need to Share My Letter to God"</p>
<p>" Dear Heavenly Father,</p>
<p>I've reached my point of final desperation. I cannot go on like this much longer. I truly hate the disease that is taking my mother from me and Satan has taken hold of my leg and won't let me go making it even more difficult to handle.</p>
<p>For much of my life I never really knew my mom, but in the last 5 years that she has been living with me, I've come to learn that I love her more than anything. I am at the point where I can't bear to watch her suffer like this. It is tearing me up inside both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>While she is not in any physical pain, this disease is wreaking havoc with her brain. She is on an emotional roller coaster and is taking me along on its chaotic ride.</p>
<p>I am thankful to still have her but it is destroying me to see her struggle like this. I'm also still thankful that she can still take direction, but the unknown is for how much longer.</p>
<p>I finally accept the fact that I am fast becoming unable to care for her and in spite of how I have felt about her doctors telling me she needs to be in a nursing home, I fear they are right. I don't want to be my mother's caregiver any longer as it is just too painful. What I want is to just be her daughter again.</p>
<p>Her quality of life is just about zero. There isn't anything that she can do on her own any more . . . she needs help with everything. She has lost interest in her computer and she's bored with tv. She spends about 90% of her life sleeping. And when she is awake she's continually asking me why I hate her so much. How can I hate her so much if I keep taking her home rather than leaving her in the nursing homes, I've virtually given up living in my own home to be with her, I see that she gets to the doctor, I see that she gets dressed, that she has her 3 meals a day and her snacks and then sit here listening to her tell me that I don't love her, and again, why do I hate her so much (and each time it feels like a knife being stabbed into my already hurting heart).</p>
<p>I hear her cry out in her sleep for you to please take her in her sleep. She thinks that you too don't want her. She keeps asking me to help her because she doesn't understand what is happening to her brain and all I can say is that it's slowing down now that she is 95.</p>
<p>Please Heavenly Father, I really don't want to put her into a nursing home as I know that she will believe that I don't want her any more and that couldn't be further from the truth. I know it is your decision as to when it's time for us to enter this world and to leave it and I pray that you will soon answer her prayer and allow her to pass as she lay in my arms and not alone in a nursing home.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're aware that I have not been the best Catholic, but I am sure I don't fall into the classification of being the worst either. I beg on bended knees that you please answer her prayer and take her back home to those of her family who have already left this earth.</p>
<p>With love and reverence,</p>
<p>I remain your Daughter "</p>
<p>I see this all the time. Caregivers and patients are desperate and they have nowhere to turn. I think the answer is so simple. With the right website posing the right questions we could easily help people like this that are crying out for assistance.</p>

<p>Re: Recommendations for a National Uniform Law Regulating Elder Facilities, Court PrefilingMediation of ADRD Family Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation, Amendment to the SSA on Caretaker Disability Entitlement and the establishment of a World Alzheimer's Institute</p>
<p>I have reviewed the NAPA Plan, as updated, and thank the Alzheimer's Organization for its awareness efforts. Consolidated informal comments and recommendations from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals follows. I thank NIH for its continuing publications on clinical trials and health related issues and the FDA for its oversight function and providing assistance to caretakers filing notices of clinical trial mismanagement. Specific recommendations fully within NAPA authority are contained at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who has been in the Alzheimer's trenches for fifteen years. We had a triple dose of this insidious disease in my extended family. I handled a level 6 case 24/7 for ten years. During this period and continuing post DOD, I remain committed to interdisciplinary research from the progression of clinical efforts to find a cure to identifying ways to improve the quality of life of those afflicted with Alzheimer's in the absence thereof. I retain an ongoing interest in the welfare of the hundreds of caretakers I have met over the years and concern with the inevitable ruinous impact of this disease on the next generation.</p>
<p>The industry report on AD entitled "<strong>Alzheimer's Drugs Market, 2012 - 2017</strong> was issued in May 2013. It is a comprehensive document which the extensive outline, (including mention of NAPA) clearly demonstrates with key objective to establish the likely evolution of leading drugs, generics and launch of new drugs across the different regions in the world. I watched the NIH sponsored Alzheimer'sDisease Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention in real time, paid particular attention to counsel and came away with no hope of cooperation for obvious proprietary legal intellectual property and economic reasons which are without the control of the NIH. In fact, it appears that the scope of any cooperation is extremely sensitive since even the appearance of infringement could result in litigation which holds up distribution of a viable curative pharmaceutical indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is some disappointment with a few NAPA initiatives perceived as a disservice to victims of ADRD without a voice who are pleading for protection and to the caretakers who give up everything to provide support.</p>
<p>I don't see the DOJ, the FDA or the IRS and United States Patent Office on your federal agency list? I don't see the ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA charged with a NAPA mandate to address legal issues in this area. Perhaps you need a broader resource base. Everyone wants to help.</p>
<p>As to the alzheimers.gov, you have a list of drugs on your site for ADRD care. The FDA has stated that certain drugs are contraindicated with elderly with dementia and are in fact life threatening. Would you please coordinate your representations with the FDA before another elderly person is seriously hurt? Regardless of the $100 million False Claims Act charges and sanctions against J&amp;J relating to Omnicare bribery, either these drugs are approved for use by the elderly ADRD or they are not. Clarification would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD population</strong></p>
<p>There is a concern that first, the base from which linear extrapolations have been made as to the number of ADRD is not statistically significant and existing and future service delivery needs will therefore be underestimated. We are not supporting the caretaker population, estimated at 25-30 million, directly or by providing adequate support for prevention of facility neglect and abuse so alternatives to home caretaking will be available.</p>
<p>What will the future hold for high school and college students who justifiably want to know whether and why they should invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart with 50% of the future population ADRD caretaking? At minimum, ADRD educational/training materials should be made available through the state library systems so caretakers/children will have easy and immediate access to free resources.</p>
<p>Second, taken to the extreme, without resolution of the causation issue, does the potential for prion scabie migration/replication through surgical equipment and water supply raise the potential for contagion and exponential as opposed to linear expansion of this population? There are patents available which deal with prion destruction in surgical equipment sterilization not currently accomplished with traditional techniques. Is it possible to address these concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Disability and Caretakers</strong></p>
<p>The SSA discriminates against caretakers of ADRD as a class in denial of disability benefits. The theory of liability as to the SS is unjust enrichment No one wants to see this mushroom into a class action but if this injustice is not rectified, another forum for redress will be pursed.</p>
<p>Caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which often consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned bysundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>Spouse caretakers usually predecease the AD patient since the stress of caretaking destroys the immune system. If children take on the responsibility they are similarly affected. Although ADRD manifests itself differently in each individual, the one common thread is the impact on the caretakers. They deal with the protracted trauma of losing the essence of their loved one years before the actual physical death. At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble.</p>
<p>The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker.</p>
<p>At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified through (1) amendment to SSA disability prerequisites relating to entitlement based time restricted contribution period for ADRD and other caretakers, or (2) a class action against the SSA for unjust enrichment of the fund attributable to private caretakers efforts and in the denial of benefits to caretakers who would otherwise qualify for disability.</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services on Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation</strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage prefilingcourt mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>When care facilities are undesirable or financially impractical, the burden falls on the family particularly in the case of ADRD where 24/7 care is involved. In many cases, qualified at home care providers are not available or are unwilling to do AD because it is just too hard. The comment I received from an agency representative was "life is too short". Unqualified at home care providers pose a danger to the patient.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the AD community that "there is always one" (family member) who assumes primary and often sole responsibility for care. Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p><strong>The ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA should draft a uniform national law regulating facilities and employees. License should be conditioned on compliance or relinquish entitlement to federal and state benefits/subsidies.</strong></p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity for a national uniform statute/regulations for state enactment regulating ECC, ALF's and SNF's, otherwise conditioning the provision of federal subsidies and benefits on facility compliance and providing stringent sanctions for violations, not only as to the facility, but as to participating health care professionals.</p>
<p>The ABA has successfully taken on uniform national laws in the past and it is particularly critical here. The attorneys from the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA have the talent and the experience in the trenches of facility abuse to handle this issue. If NAPA fails to give a voice to elderly ADRD through strong advocacy and protection of their interests, they will have failed their mandate.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald issued a three part investigative report in 2011entitled, "Neglected to Death" <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com">http://www.miamiherald.com/neglectedtodeath/index.html#morer</a> This is essential reading for anyone in this field. The Nursing home abuse blog and other resources provides an overview of, for example Emeritus (California - wrongful death, Florida - bed sores, medication misadministration and falsification of medical records etc. etc.) Usually the response is simply to convert to a lower classification of care (independent living) to circumvent future state oversight. The Florida legislature has twice failed to enact legislation to remedy abuse. The industry is now attempting to enact legislation in Florida which will make it more difficult to sue for abuse.</p>
<p>With advance apology to truly outstanding health care professionals delivering quality care, caretakers do not place their loved ones in facilities because the (1) the health, safety and security of the ADRD cannot be assured in substandard, understaffed facilities (2) there is excessive doping (chemical restraints) to compensate for inadequate staffing, (3) the facilities do not take high level ADRD without a 24/7 private aide making it a cost prohibitive venture, (4) Medicaid beds are not made available to ADRD unless the condition developed post initial admission, and (4) the state is lax or nonresponsive in enforcement.</p>
<p>Please understand our collective, absolute fury with your "15%" reduction in doping and demand for clarification. This is a civil rights if not a criminal battery issue. It is not subject to arbitrary and callous treatment as an administrative efficiency issue. Visit an AL or SNF and speak with families and attorneys who specialize in this field. Look at your own deficiency reports on the 620 nursing facilities in Florida alone and the court abuse claims against assisted living facilities. There are a substantial number of attorneys in the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA who would be happy to provide education.</p>
<p>When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Which 8.5% of this group are you comfortable abandoning?</p>
<p>We had three experiences with respite in ten years in two high level SNF's and one hospice, each stay under two weeks. The first resulted in a hip fracture with the elderly woman in the next bed in the same condition. (The other woman was given haldoland cried for hours.) The second stay resulted in extensive bruising, a cut on the forehead and a hematoma on both arms. The hospice, situated in a hospital, was advised preadmission that the ADRD could not call for help and, as a fall risk, did not need diapering but needed a commode next to the bed which she could utilize. They put her as far away from the nursing station as possible in a room with a woman who was incapable of any communication, put her in diapers she would not use and put the side bed rails up. Within 8 hours of admission, she had fallen attempting to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and had ripped open her leg about 10 inches. When I arrived at 5 am, she was bleeding on the bed. (My father entered a hospital without a mark on his body and was discharged with a stage 3 decubitus with MRSA on his coccyx.) All of this has to stop now.</p>
<p>To the extent doping, neglect and abuse is not rectified, elderly will continue suffering and families will forfeit their livelihood, savings, children college funds and quality of life to keep their loved ones safe at home. Please do not make it the policy of NAPA to tolerate any form of institutionalized abuse.</p>
<p>Many facilities are not capable of or are unwilling to provide essential services to insure the safety and care of their elderly residents. There are too many profiteer operators opening what are essentially extended stays with food service, mandating understaffed facilities to achieve a substantial owner benefit/ROI without regard for the quality of life of their residents.</p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly. Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same. Similarly, federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>The foregoing does not overlook and in fact should aggressively pursue actions for assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse as appropriate through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, who, in turn, should immediately notify all concerned federal and state concerned authorities of the pendency of any investigation and subsequent charges. I have discussed this matter with major city police from San Francisco to Boston and they have horrifying tales.</p>
<p>This industry is unable to regulate itself. The recent ALA request for state plans was disappointing. Florida ALA declined to do its own report and adopted the Texas plan. None are particularly effective in addressing resident issues if reform would economically burden the owner.</p>
<p>The uniform national law act should set forth, with specificity, optimal minimum standards for facility operation including but not limited to</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Qualification and licensing of owners/operators (in Florida you need high school to operate an ALF),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum facility per patient staffing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background investigation, qualifications and training of staff,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated in its entirety,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program of cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD. Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF if attendant medical issues, (The advent of IPADS and touch screens opens new door in this area for ADRD who could not negotiate a mouse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of distance web cams to permit HSC and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat sensoredmonitoring of fall risks and ADRD so movement leading to bed vacation at night can be identified by staff prior to injury or wandering and without alarms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory immediate notification to HSC of injury to patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment to prevent staff injury have to be provided in each facility. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese without injuring themselves. (Robots exist to deliver medication in hospitals. Cornell has a robot to take a beer out of the refrigerator deliver and pour it. Why not a robot to help? It has to be less in cost than repeated hip fractures, rehab and OSHA damage awards.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software access between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who is aggressive in medication management and I quickly discovered that nurses resented any inquiry. This has to stop. We are HCS's and we need this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HSC, POA and family of their options, including referral to counsel and a NAELA contact number or availability of court mediation services. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNR forms and living wills have to be uniform nationally. (Florida requires the forms to be in a particular format on yellow paper?)</p>

</ol><p><strong>The WHO has declared ADRD as an international health crisis. International cooperation requires a different approach from the NAPA plan with consolidation and dedication of international resources solely to scientific research. </strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization calls on nations to recognize dementia as a global public health crisis. Nobel Laureate, Dr. Stanley Prusiner, immediate past Director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at UCSF, and recently appointed Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Cleveland Clinic Lou RuvoCenter for Brain Health, along with The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation which funds the work of Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Greengardand every other internationally prominent scientist considers Alzheimer's one of the most devastating and grossly underfunded illnesses affecting society and are staunch advocates of a significant increase in funding to make substantial breakthroughs.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>A World Alzheimer's Center under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation in affiliation with the WHO providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges should be created. (See eg. Norway's Snoezalen rooms <a href="http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp">http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp</a>, advances made by John Hopkin'sCopper Ridge, Melabev in Israel, the Fisher Institute at NYU, the University of Florida's Smart Room, games and brain training to name a few.)</p>
<p>While seed money could be provided through NAPA, this fund is insufficient to provide national support for ADRD research demands much less international efforts. Similarly, the Alzheimer's organization has its own challenges in infrastructure support particularly given the scope of their service delivery.</p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>In the absence of sufficient government appropriation and given the cost of fundraising/air time, a new vehicle to accomplish the $5-10 billion needed for ADRD research must be identified and pursued through the international community. It has been suggested (and inspired in part by Google's Razoo) that the search engines should be engaged as the only viable means of effectively coordinating, in every language, a coordinated time restricted massive campaign on the front page of the engines to elicit international financial support to expeditiously achieve essential support. Properly structured, the engines can slice through the overhead to accomplish direct benefit to scientific research in fulfillment of the intent of the donor and the international public trust through the Alzheimer's Federation of 78 nations in affiliation with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The current reaction to NAPA is that, despite the best intentions and through no fault, the current approach is underfinanced, piecemeal at best and holds no ascertainable hope of accomplishing an expeditious cure. You need a great deal of money and resources to save the next generation. If you want to accomplish significant goals, you have to put international firepower behind your efforts.</p>

					Dementia-Friendly Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>As a person living with this disease I find it a challenge these days to be able to communicate with the rest of the team. While I appear to be very normal when we have short talks, there are many issues that I struggle with. I have lost the sharpness and quick response needed to be able to interact with you all at your level. It makes it even harder when many of you have very high IQs. With time you will learn that while I may not respond immediately, answers come to me many hours later. Sometimes they never do. When I hear conversations I do not hear the entire sentence but part of it, and in my mind I fill in the blanks. It's weird to know you have many answers in your head, but cannot find a way to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Because of all this, and because we are breaking up into various teams I want to ensure I will have the opportunity to share my visions of what I would like to see. Some of these ideas come from others who have created them before me, and many are my own ideas or a combination of both ideas.</p>
<p>There is no true order and some things may even be duplicated due to my lack of recall. I did have help from others in the editing of this document. Below is my short list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness, Education, &amp; Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people who don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>The stigma must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws needs to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and business.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Create work environments in which we can still feel productive without penalty to the employer or the person living with the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the researcher and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Communities </strong></p>
<p>My vision of a dementia-friendly community is a bit involved, but if it's implemented it will have a huge impact in many ways. When I think of a dementia-friendly community it refers mostly to those who are in the early to mid stages of the disease. This idea was first started in the UK by my friend Norm McNamara who is living with Lewy Body Dementia.</p>
<p>This community should include first responders, health providers, local businesses, public transportation providers, airports, and the public.</p>
<p>I think the best way to achieve this is to create a system that allows individuals to register with the state, or someone of equal standing, this should include care partners as well as it's important to have emergency info on the caregiver. I would like to see something similar to MedicAlert at a state level.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief outline of the MedicAlert system.</p>
<p><strong>MedicAlert® + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return</strong>® is a 24-hour nationwide emergency response service for individuals with Alzheimer's or a related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. We provide 24-hour assistance, no matter when or where the person is reported missing.</p>
<ul><li>If an individual with Alzheimer's or a related dementia wanders and becomes lost, caregivers can call the 24-hour emergency response line (1.800.625.3780) to report it.</li>
<li>A community support network will be activated, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies. With this service, critical medical information will be provided to emergency responders when needed.</li>
<li>If a citizen or emergency personnel finds the person with dementia, they can call the toll-free number listed on person's MedicAlert + Safe Return ID jewelry. MedicAlert + Safe Return will notify the listed contacts, making sure the person is returned home.</li>
</ul><p>Six in 10 people with dementia will wander and/or get lost. A person with Alzheimer's may not remember their name or address, and can become disoriented, even in familiar places. For people with dementia wandering is dangerous, but there are strategies and services to help prevent it.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has developed training tools and support programs to prepare law enforcement, EMTs, fire fighters and other first responders when they encounter a person who is wandering.</p>
<p>Anyone who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk for wandering. Even in the early stages of dementia, a person can become disoriented or confused for a period of time. It's important to plan ahead for this type of situation. Wandering and getting lost can happen during any stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:</p>
<ul><li>Returns from a regular walk or drive later than usual</li>
<li>Tries to fulfill former obligations, such as going to work</li>
<li>Tries or wants to "go home", even when at home</li>
<li>Is restless, paces or makes repetitive movements</li>
<li>Has difficulty locating familiar places like the bathroom, bedroom or dining room</li>
<li>Asks the whereabouts of current or past friends and family</li>
<li>Acts as if doing a hobby or chore, but nothing gets done (e.g. moves around pots and dirt without actually planting anything)</li>
<li>Appears lost in a new or changed environment</li>
</ul><p>The information on your medical alert bracelet will connect health professionals with your emergency medical information. We provide memberships and services designed to protect you and your loved ones during a medical emergency or time of need.</p>
<p>MedicAlert's medical bracelets, medical IDs, and other medical jewelry have been used to alert responders of the underlying medical conditions a patient may have - such as allergies, anaphylaxes, diabetes, and autism. First responders are trained by MedicAlert staff to recognize all forms of medical IDs, and our services ensure they get your up-to-date medical information, the moment they need it, to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. MedicAlert services and medical IDs are also used to communicate advance directives and can even help those with Alzheimer's or dementia make it home safely during wandering emergencies.</p>
<p>For more information please visit their website: <a href="http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp">http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp</a></p>
<p>Those who choose to register would wear a bracelet similar to the one above or some type of dog tag on a chain. By registering the people would be able to take advantage of many benefits. Family would need to register and could be set up when in the clinic for diagnosis as well as info bracelet... ordered and resources given out.</p>
<p>All those registered would be given a unique identification number that will have basic information that could be used in case of emergency. To stop the system being abused or compromised, this information should only be accessible by the relevant people, following a secure procedure and calling a special telephone number and providing the person's ID number. (This would only be accessed by calling a provided number)</p>
<p>It may include information like blood type, allergies, drug information, doctors, emergency contacts, and addresses.</p>
<p>This system needs to be linked with the 911 systems, and the yellow dot program. When a person calls the fire department the address should be flagged immediately when it comes up as a person with dementia living in the residence they are being dispatched to. This is important for many reasons.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may panic in this situation and may not know how to respond to the emergency conditions. They may be much worse than a child in some cases, and just curl up in a corner in fear and just stay there. They may not even speak out when people are calling their name. They may have even started the fire and are scared. They could be combative and the firefighters need to know how to deal with that situation. There are many other reasons why the firemen need to be aware before arriving.</p>
<p>If we ever have some kind of a natural disaster or need to evacuate for some emergency this system will be a major asset, especially for those who may be at home on their own. By being registered this will insure a much better outcome for those who may not be able to think for themselves. Many of these people would not leave with just a simple call and they may not even understand what is said in robo-call type alerts.</p>
<p>If the police are called that should also be flagged immediately. It could be the person with dementia calling in, and not able to articulate the problem. It could even be a false alarm because they are scared when there is really no threat. Sometimes people with dementia have been known to make serious accusations of being threatened by their spouse with a gun, which has led to spouses being locked up for days because the system was not aware of the person's dementia. Again, if members of the emergency services are coming to a house where a person with dementia resides, they need to treat threats in a completely different way otherwise it can escalate and even become deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Police: Weapons &amp; Driving </strong></p>
<p>While I am on the subject of issues with police there is a document which I shared with the chief of police a few years ago. While some changes are being implemented in some parts of the US, I am not sure they are being addressed in PA. I tried to reach out to my local police department and training facilities, but was just blown off. One of the biggest and most serious issues that I feel needs to be addresses is that of weapons. I came very close to taking my life, and even told a police officer on the telephone, but he refused to do anything. I just wonder how many other people pleaded for help and ended up killing themselves because nobody answered their cry for help. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with dementia get confused or feel threatened and may make accusations that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very differently from someone without dementia. Some would say like a mental illness. They believe what they are saying is fact.</p>
<p>We require a place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that this could be accomplished without too much impact on the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home, and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped for a sobriety test they may fail because they have trouble following instructions or poor gait. They may also be much slower with their responses, and may even give you a blind stare because they are confused. They may not be able to follow complex directions. Directions need to be broken down into steps.</p>
<p>I know we want to make the roads safe so we need better testing methods for Alzheimer's patients who drive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's patients can sometimes become very aggressive and defensive during an argument, they can even become threatening. This is the wrong time to try to remove them from their home. They need to be calmed down first; otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, because many will not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Be prepared to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost. We can get lost while driving; this does not mean we cannot drive. These two issues are often confused by many.</p>
<p>The car should also have some sort of identification mark. It could be tied-in with the yellow dot system; however, I am concerned that we may become a target because of that. We are much more gullible because of this disease and that could be a very serious issue. I was someone who always kept all those scammers at a far distance, and now I am starting to fall prey to some and think it will only get worse as time goes on and I get worse. It could be on a driver's license, like a donor or class B license. It could be a code that is not obvious to all.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Symbol: The Purple Angel </strong></p>
<p>There is a common logo that is slowly becoming the internationally known symbol for those living with dementia and I think we should use it. It is called the Purple Angel.</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngel.jpg" style="height:25px; width:27px" />To be used on all websites and dementia patients information and hospitals</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngelStamp.jpg" style="height:28px; width:30px" /> For stores and businesses to show they know and have been educated</p>
<p>This was created by Norm McNamara and is starting to get a lot of recognition. In fact it is now going to be used in some US hospitals as an indicator that the person has cognitive issues; they hang it on the door of the hospital room of the patient. I recommend that we adopt this symbol for all programs connected to dementia-friendly communities.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>While I am speaking about hospitals, below is a list of issues that I have been working on with a local hospital in hopes of starting the first dementia-friendly hospital in PA. I was trying to build a training program with the Alzheimer's Association along with a question and answer session with people like me who are living with the disease. Below is the list I have shared with them. Some hospitals are actually doing a quick cognitive test by asking 3 words upon registering to see if there may be a concern even if the person does not have a diagnosis. I would expect that all hospitals would educate staff on the issues, for instance we can easily get lost while trying to find a department as an outpatient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<ul><li>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</li>
</ul><p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<ul><li>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself; a bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</li>
</ul><p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate - that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly or the stress of just being out of our routine. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>There are special things one needs to know about using Anesthesia. Anesthetic agents are a cause for concern in AD pathogenesis. Luckily, the field of Anesthesiology has addressed these concerns in an excellent and honest manner. I would defer to their consensus statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full">http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full</a><br /><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/</a></p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be to avoid isoflorane.</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While ordering food from a menu is simple, it is very overwhelming for me to keep track of things and what items may even go together, or are even needed. I will probably need help with this task.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus. Again this is why training on all levels is so critical.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. This is very subjective depending on the person. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given - they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>
<p>This is the wristband that will be implemented to all patients with dementia at Brooksville Regional Hospital, along with this square magnet to be place on the outside of the patient's room on the doorframe. Before any of these wristbands will be used, training seminars from the Alzheimer's Association will held for all of the hospital staff members. Training should start in about a month. This is a major step forward in maintaining the safety of all dementia patients during hospital stays.</p>
<p>The hospital loves the purple angel logo, We went through three different band designs before this. The problem being that purple is also the national color for DNR. What I love about it the most is that it's for "all dementias," which is what we truly need in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Businesses </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to dementia-friendly businesses; I envision that businesses take a 7 or 8 hour course provided for free by the Alzheimer's Association and others, to make them aware of the issues that people with dementia deal with, and what they may need help with. On completion of the course they will get a sticker that they can place in their place of business that says Dementia-Aware with a picture of the logo. By doing this we will be creating awareness, and educating many on how to make it easier for us to still function as members of society; something that is not always easy when you are an adult who is slowly becoming a child again.</p>
<p>Some of the issues may be</p>
<ul><li>feeling panic in a large store when becoming separated from the person they came with</li>
<li>being asked a question and not being able to respond, or even giving the wrong information</li>
<li>having trouble locating items in stores</li>
<li>no longer being able to calculate how much they have spent or can spend if they have a budget</li>
<li>getting lost, losing sense of direction, or not being able to locate the car in the parking lot</li>
<li>it would be nice to get assistance when there are similar products to choose from, because I can no longer do comparison shopping based on price, or if an item in the same category is on sale</li>
</ul><p>Not everyone will easily display, or even be willing to wear the bracelet or dog tag because of the stigma surrounding this disease. Only when this changes will people feel more comfortable about sharing their diagnosis with others.</p>
<p>Even though we are living with AD we should be encouraged to live life to the fullest. We need to keep our minds engaged. We should be able to work, and to still do high level functioning jobs, and the company not be penalized, and the person with the disease should not be impacted by SS because they are working. As volunteers I would expect that our transportation expenses be paid for, and maybe even lunch. This will have a positive impact on the people with the disease and be of great benefit to a company that can utilize the person. Some do not want jobs like pushing hospital beds around, or doing simple tasks when we have a high function skill set.</p>
<p>The state can help AD people to live life to the fullest in many ways. For those that are still driving they should be given a disabled sign for their car. It helps me in many ways such as finding my car when I park in a strange place or large lots. For those that are not driving, allow us the same opportunity as seniors. This will help us get around much easier. For suburban areas allow us access to the transportation for the disabled at the discounted rates.</p>
<p>The state can offer free access to national parks, fishing and boating for a small size water craft for the person living with the disease and a caregiver since in many cases they will need someone to take them. All of this can be centered on having the bracelet which will simplify the process and minimize any costs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to make it simple for these people because they will most likely not be able to fill out many of the forms needed to qualify. I am sure there are many other things that can be made available.</p>
<p>Writing skills can be impacted hindering communicating. An idea would be to forward our unedited letters to schools to be used as a part of the English classes; the students would edit the letter and send it back so we can send it. It would also be great if we could take college courses for free with the idea that we are not getting a degree or credits.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing tickets for travelling on trains etc. staff need to be aware that we may need help. We may not be able to check in at the airport unaided. We should not be penalized for not being able to take advantage of online offers because we cannot use computers. We may need to be taken to a gate or to a temporary room until our flight or train is ready (this does not mean we need to be ferried about in a wheelchair!)</p>

</ul><p>I would like to see a simple pamphlet be put together for those who are living with the disease covering all the benefits available to us with AD. It must be simple to understand, short and to the point. The procedure should include all of the resources available and where one should turn. Today one has no clue and they do not know what is available. This should be handed out with a diagnosis from your doctor.</p>
<p>Laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve. Let's stop burdening the social security system. Because there is no clear test for the diagnosis of YOAD, many diagnoses are delayed. Many people are terminated from jobs, and are unable to collect their long-term disability insurance, because of the two-year law. Most diagnoses occur much later, as in my case. I paid a lot of money into a long-term health disability plan in my company and I lost it all because of the law. I now get less than a third of what I would have been entitled to, and no medical coverage which I would also have had, all because of a law that does not work for individuals with this disease. Changes must be put in place until we have better tests available. If someone is terminated for non-performance and they have been diagnosed with dementia at a later time, they should have the right to go back at least six years to prove their case. Companies should not get a free pass because we all pay for this injustice. The two year law is a failure for people like me with dementia.</p>
<p>I was terminated from my job before I got a diagnosis which took another 6 years. Now I am forced to rely on government disability. Alzheimer's is a sickness. This is a disease, and the people who have it should be treated that way.</p>
<p>Companies need to treat AD like any other disability. The following comments were put together from a person who works in HR.</p>
<p>Tell your story to HR Management. What kind of company do they want to be? How will they protect their human resource that has dementia - and be good risk managers by taking appropriate action to minimize the risk of litigation for wrongful termination under ADA? What are the costs of unrecognized dementia in employees i.e., lost productivity, errors, quality, odd/unexplained behavior, a decline in management skills leading to more of the above? What are the State percentages? Give examples - If they are a company of 1,000 employees that equates to xx employees who will have early onset dementia - can they afford to be blind to the problems these individuals will cost the organization? Alzheimer's is not all about the needs of the caregiver. Little to no attention is given to the INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA. If the company has a PEP program (Personal Employee Program that typically provides 8 to 12 sessions of counseling when an employee suffers from personal problems (divorce, runaway kids, elderly care, etc.) why not have a Dementia Hotline/Exploration. Why not help people self-diagnose early and assist them to seek a medical diagnosis, so TOGETHER the employee and company can make a plan for them to ultimately exit from the company with dignity - example: an employee is still skilled, but may need to move from having the responsibility of being a manager to becoming an individual contributor. Why wait to FIRE someone for non-performance, when you could continue to employ the person until the day comes where there is no job which matches the employee's skills. A diagnosis of dementia IS protected under ADA. Why wait to be sued by an employee who was unfairly terminated because of his disability. Why not be proactive and humane, keep the person off unemployment; mitigate your exposure to litigation. Such a small cost to set up a program to assist and empower employees to work TOGETHER with them, give them dignity and determine together when it is time to go. Help them transition to retirement with disability; unemployment; assistance from the Alz Association.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Issues &amp; Necessary System Change </strong></p>
<p>Younger-onset Alzheimer's, also known as early-onset Alzheimer's, generally refers to those who are affected by the disease before the age of 65, usually in their 40s or 50s. Because of their younger age and healthy appearance, doctors often attribute symptoms of Alzheimer's to depression or stress, resulting in delayed diagnosis. These symptoms, such as challenges with short-term memory, impaired judgment and difficulty making decisions, eventually progress to a point where they affect workplace performance, and ultimately, jeopardize employment. Many individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's are in their prime earning years and supporting loved ones at home. The loss of income and access to employer-sponsored health benefits can be devastating.</p>
<p>This document reflects State and Federal issues that may not be working. My goal is that if the existing jurisdiction responsible is not able to enhance the process, the other will step in and fill in the gaps so people are not impacted. It is my hope that they can work together to fix the weaknesses in the system that may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>To help address their financial need, many individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In March 2010, the Social Security Administration (SSA) added early-onset Alzheimer's to its Compassionate Allowance Initiative, which expedites the disability determination process and serves as a trigger to begin the two-year wait for Medicare benefits for those under the age of 65. Family members (e.g. spouses and minor children) may also be eligible for benefits based on the applicant's work record. This addition by SSA has been a huge relief for individuals and families dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Many are treated like they are crooks when they apply for Social Security Disability. It creates an added burden on the family and the patient. People say that the Compassionate Allowance act will help people, but it did not help me, and many keep saying that it works. The following story is from an ongoing case. This program may be better but the people who run the programs are clueless in many ways on what a person with AD can or cannot do. This person is not only struggling financially, but has no one to look out for them. I cannot even imagine the hell they must be going through because it would take me forever to complete the same forms.</p>
<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>It's so nice of you to think of me. I wanted to add that the reason I was turned down on the first application and reconsideration was because I filled out the RFC form myself (I lived alone at the time and it was a necessity) and not for lack of medical evidence. My son now lives with me but only minimally supervises me and does the driving. An examiner at Social Security took it upon himself to send out an investigative unit because he felt I must be faking Alz even though in the course of the application and reconsideration, I saw 5 doctors, 4 of whom thought I had Alz disease and 1 CE examiner who thought it was possible but hesitated because I still have average intelligence (my IQ was in the 140s when I was in graduate school and now around 100, which I think this is an alarming decline). This SAA evaluator then proceeded to imply that all the doctors I saw were fooled. He even sent out an investigative unit to actually <strong>videotape me without my knowledge</strong> (following me to one my CE appointment one day and sending undercover police officers to my home the following day). I don't remember the investigators coming to my home and didn't see them at the hospital (obviously quite good at the stealth part). At the hospital, the doctor walked me out to the lobby because he was afraid I would get lost said a few minutes later I "disappeared (I got my ride, of course)." They went back to the doctor looking for me, and he apparently was very concerned I had actually gotten lost in the hospital. At my house, they said I walked slow to answer the door but I didn't limp (???) and was polite and had my hair combed (implying I was not disabled based on my outward appearance and probably less than 30 seconds of conversation). The evaluator felt that anyone who could describe their symptoms on an application, write mostly coherently, (though always needing multiple edits, spell check, and entailing a lot of repetitiveness) answer the door, use a phone, live alone, or drive in the early stages had to be faking it regardless of MRI, neurological tests, etc., that clearly gave me a diagnosis of EOAD. Long-winded, I'm sorry. I'm still feeling kind of abused and outraged. As for now, my lawyer thinks he can get me a hearing OTR and I'm hoping for that and a favorable decision If not, it will be another 12-15 months before I have a hearing date, this because the SSA evaluator apparently does not understand that early-stage Alzheimer's is not immediately visible on the surface. In the meantime, I am now in the process of selling my home to live with my adult son as we can no longer afford the upkeep (this is a modest home - but now far above my means).</p>
<p>I'm very lucky that my son is living with me to help, but it means I do not qualify for Medicaid because his income is now considered my income and puts us just above the income limit. He can't put me on his insurance as I don't qualify as a dependent because of my small LTD policy, which in turn needs to be repaid to the insurance company if I do get SSDI. I've gone from a single, self-supporting middle class woman, to lower middle class, now to poverty level in the course of about 4 years. Without my son's help, I'm probably within 3 months of living on the street. At the same time, I'm suddenly placing a tremendous burden on him and fouling up his goals in life.</p>
<p>Another note: I find it ironic that my neurologist tells me to exercise vigorously, take care of my health, and socialize as much as possible in order to function longer whereas I sense the government is telling me that I'm not eligible for disability insurance (despite working since age 13 and paying into the system for years) unless I give up, lie in bed, and wait to die.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Alz Assoc could find a way to educate the SSA evaluators on what Alzheimer's disease looks like in younger people in the early stages so that other people don't go through what I'm going through now. It would also be great if they could lobby for earlier Medicare benefits (rather than the 2 year wait after SSDI) for all disabilities that are only going to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Awareness is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Awareness of YOAD will change the public perception of who gets Alzheimer's - young people. People who are under 30 get it. Use commercials, billboards or posters in key places to get the word out. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people because most don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease not just a result of aging.</p>
<p>Awareness of outcomes for AD -- Currently people who have Alzheimer's cannot be cured. There is no way to slow the progression of the disease, and most die within 4 to 8 years of diagnosis. While these two statements are strong I feel this is what it's going to take to reach younger generations and others to jump in and help. We cannot beat around the bush; the public needs to know that this is a horrific way to die. Death by Alzheimer's is slow and painful not to mention the impact it has on the family. Places like the Alzheimer's Association and others need to open with all the facts about the disease so people are prepared.</p>
<p>Remove the negative stigma associated with the disease. Too many people are ashamed to let others know that they have this disease. They act like they did something wrong to get it. Now is the time to join me, come out of the closet, hold your head up and be proud in making a difference in how we are looked upon by ourselves, and others. WE need to show that we are still capable of doing some things at our own pace.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those that are no longer capable, while not impacting those that are still able to drive. It should be based on the person's true driving experience and ability, and not on perceptions or fears. It should have nothing to do with getting lost; GPS tracking devices can help us if that is a concern. Many people have the misconception that if a person with AD is in an accident the insurance company will not pay for the claim, or may even sue them. While there are many tests available to test one's driving, many are not fair to a person living with AD. In fact if the average person was given the same test they may even fail. Better tests that deal the individual living with the disease are needed and all must be able to test this test. Some of the cognitive tests do not correlate to driving ability, but to failing and singling out people with AD. That is completely unfair. For example I fail the Trail-Making Test, Part B and I still drive very good. The testing should be free or paid by insurance. These tests can cost around $300 -$350, and provide annually. Every 2-3 months we should drive with a spouse or other person who understands us to see how well we drive. That should be a regular part of our future lives, and they should be the ones to tell us when they feel it is time to give up driving. I am not saying that people with AD should not eventually stop driving, but it should be done for the right reasons -- that they will become a danger to them or someone else. What we need to focus on are the real problems of driving, and not the side issues related to them. We must embrace new ways to deal with people with AD and find new opportunities and technologies to use to our advantage so we can enhance the lives of those suffering with this disease, and so they can continue to lead a normal life for as long as possible. Do not fall into the one-size-fits-all trap because all those living with AD are different from each other and we must figure out a way to make everyone feel safe including those living with the disease. We are still human beings.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that one day I will have an accident and my license will be taken away. It may not have anything to do with my Alzheimer's, but it will be perceived that way. I have had 3 to 4 car accidents in my lifetime, some being my fault while most were others. We all have them. As a person living with AD I seem to notice much more. I see many people run through lights, not use turn signals or come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I see people cut others off or shift in to other's lanes without paying attention. All I can think is that if people saw me do any of these things they would want to take my driver's license away, yet all of these folks are normal and they just get a free pass. Why?</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is. One should not be impacted by other laws that were not designed or intended for those living with this type of disease. There are many state and federal programs that limit us from being able to contribute to or benefits we are not entitled to because of our age. Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia. A family should have a cap on what they must payout. Why should the surviving spouse be left penniless because their partner was sick? Is it enough that most of us have already had to deal with financial hardship we were not accustom to?</p>
<p>Pa. Caregiver Support Program (care recipient/household income must be @ 200% of poverty or below for max. reimbursement.</p>
<p>Below are just of a few of the ways this disease is costing me more money than ever. I once did most things around the house and now I have to rely on others and the cost is adding up very quickly. Many things are becoming neglected which will have a greater cost in the long run. I used to be good at comparison shopping and now I no longer do it because I cannot recall the price so I can compare. This has such a huge impact from food, gas, utilities and everyday items.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), individuals with a pre-existing condition receiving SSDI can join high-risk insurance pools3 and receive immediate health insurance coverage while they wait for Medicare benefits to become available. This has been particularly helpful for those who are unable to find affordable health insurance because of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The program will end in 2014, at which time individuals can purchase health insurance through their state-based insurance exchange or qualify for Medicaid under its expanded criteria. Pennsylvania has yet to decide whether or not it wants to participate in the Medicaid expansion, which according to one estimate, will cost the state 1.4 percent more than current spend to reduce the number of uninsured adults by over 40%.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of care, Alzheimer's imposes an immense burden on families. Last year, there were an estimated 664,384 unpaid caregivers in Pennsylvania, providing 756,600,213 hours of unpaid care valued at over $9 billion. Unfortunately, the physical toll of caring for Alzheimer's also resulted in over $427 million in additional healthcare costs to unpaid caregivers in your state. To assist those who care for people with Alzheimer's in Pennsylvania, the state offers the Pennsylvania Caregiver Support Program. Preference is given to caregivers of care recipients who are 60 years or older, but eligibility was recently expanded to include care recipients who are 18 years or older. All care recipients must demonstrate functional limitation and financial need.</p>
<p>Regrettably, age is still a barrier to other support programs for individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's and their caregivers. All caregiver support programs that receive funding under Title III of the Older Americans Act require care recipients to be at least 60 years or older. Likewise, Pennsylvania's Medicaid 60+ waiver and aging block grants are only available to those who are at least 60 years old. Restricting eligibility by age, rather than diagnosis, forces many families affected by younger-onset Alzheimer's to exhaust their own resources and put their own health and financial security at risk.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways to make it better for those impacted. Physician education -- Doctors need to be better educated, and need to commit to a more timely diagnosis so that patients can collect the benefits they deserve and are entitled. Doctors should not act like our lives are over. Once a diagnosis is made it should automatically trigger a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist so the person can learn to deal with the devastating news. Many people are in denial and waste that last few years not knowing what to do. Instead they should be living life to the fullest. Make the memories. We must be encouraged to make living wills and put our financials in order quickly since our minds are going. We have no time to delay. Encourage participation in medical trails and offer frequent checkups.</p>
<p>Living wills should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>We must encourage research and provide funding. In order to eradicate this disease we need to find more sources of funding and redistribute current government funding to bring Alzheimer's to a level comparable to other disease research. Trials need to provide more flexibility by using technology. Many are unable to participate due to lack of flexibility. Some people do not participate in clinical trials because they feel it will not help them. They need to know that it's not about them but what they do can help someone in their family should they get the disease. Since a cure may be long in coming, it would also be nice to see more funding provided to investigate treatment methods to maintain independent function longer. The drug companies have taken the stage and it's all about what increases their profit and not necessarily about what will help the patients.</p>
<p>Make government grant programs free, fair and balanced - Some researchers using government research grants are discriminating by age and minorities because of rules being set forth by both the provider and the receiving researcher. This will prevent the formation of an accurate picture of this disease. For example, black people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's. Why?</p>
<p>Eliminate the term Caregiver - Come up with a new term for the word caregiver when used for people in the following stages Very mild decline (2), Mild decline (3) and Moderate decline(4). We find it very demeaning and do not like being treated like a child. Help us where we are weak, but don't give up on us just because we have now been labeled with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>We need away a way to break down many of the silos and built a coalition of companies and sites to work as one. Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) is a diverse and growing national coalition of 58 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The only sad part is the Alzheimer's National has not joined due to not being able to set politics aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/</a></p>
<p>This is all part of the problem - a lack of willingness to work together. I am not sure what the state can do here but we need to find a way to encourage others to work in harmony for the greater good of what we all seem to claim. We are doing this for dementia. Sometimes I really wonder and I think it just a business for these folks.</p>
<p>I know I have made many recommendations around the use of the Alzheimer Association as part of this document. Because of that I want to give full disclosure. I was a past ESAG member and I am currently still an ambassador for them. For those who know me they would tell you I am not influenced by others and my dedication is to those impacted by the disease. With that being said I do feel they deserve a lot of credit for what they have accomplished in the last 30 or more years. They take a lot of heat for some issue that are out of their control due to some high level expectation of the public.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do not want you to think that they have all the answers because I and many others realize that they do not do justice for many like me who are dealing with the disease. They focus on the caregiver and not us. Part of the problem in my eyes is the lack of a business mind across the board, and lack of a CEO approach to business. Because of that scenario there is much inconsistency in the organization and much time is lost in understanding our needs and minds. That all leads to very slow response or lack of response to the very services they think are great. They have this internal mindset that everything has to be done a specific way and that is always the right way, yet the people are not given the tools. The sad truth- it is not and I have worked on changing some of that and I can assure you it's not an easy task. I encourage that we continue to work with them but at the same time we need to demand change and at a much faster pace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am sharing this with you in hope that, as you do your planning, you take my findings in to account when making recommendations to others. We must treat all people who are suffering from dementia, regardless of stage, with the highest level of respect all the way through to the end. While this may not apply to all, it would appear that many who are even in stage seven are still able to communicate in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Living Life with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Below are some articles I have written in the past, you may learn how someone with AD is dealing with this disease. These are my favorite that I feel people have been able to learn and see another side that they did not know before.</p>
<p>I have worked on this for about five months, and recently I shared the email below with many sites related to AD for feedback. Most of those who had reached out to me were able to support my findings. The bottom line is that while most of us have limited thinking capacity many are able to communicate; we just have to find a way that suits the individual. I received a lot of feedback. My biggest concern is that most people are clueless, and assume that we cannot understand what they are saying about us; many say cruel things. Just try to imagine for a minute what it would be like to hear what others may say or do to you, and you are never given an opportunity to defend or express yourself. That is what is happening to most of these folks.</p>
<p>We must find a better way to educate caregivers, health professionals, and all those working with people living with this disease. The biggest problem I see is that everything is time-based because of the costs. This view will not work for people. It will also take special training, and the need to break with our normal habits of communicating. If we are going to be able to reach out to them, we need to change. We are still human beings and we deserve to be treated in a respectful and dignified manner.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I have been living with AD much longer than most people who have had this devastating disease. I am in need of your help to prove a point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have learned that as we progress with Alzheimer's/dementia, we lose our brain functioning and can no longer think. I am starting to believe that this is not true.</p>
<p>It has now happened to me on multiple occasions where I was asked a question, and I am able to formulate the answer in my mind, yet I found myself unable to verbalize it. Sometimes my mouth may move but nothing comes out. It was the weirdest thing, and I could not understand why it was happening to me. I was aware of what was going on, but could do nothing.</p>
<p>Since that time I have asked 18 other people with some type of dementia, and of them 16 had similar experiences. Two of them said they had not. This makes me think that as this disease progresses our brain may still be functioning, yet it is unable to communicate with the rest of the body, allowing it to have less control than it would normally have. I truly believe I am on to something, and was curious as to how I can try to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. About three years ago I met the daughter of a man with AD. He was no longer communicating with her because, she was sure, he could no longer commutate at all. Someone suggested she ask a question, and keep totally silent for at least two minutes after. About a minute and a half later he finally responded to her question. From that time on she realized what she had to do and was thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to think it's going to be that easy; it will take a lot of work, patience and persistence on your part. Here is what I would like others to try for someone who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. First of all take the person to a very quiet room; it should not have any kind of background noise even from things like an air-conditioner blowing. Those noises are real problems for me, and would assume it will be a bigger issue for them. Such noises really have an impact on my ability to process and focus. You should also do this at a time of day that they are not tired. It becomes very challenging for us to try to focus and listen to what others say. It really becomes tiring, and we get burned out quickly.</p>
<p>When you start to speak to the person use short sentences, and pause in between them so they have time to process what you are saying. That is very important. Tell them that you think you have found a way to communicate with them. Tell them you are going to look at them closely for some sort of sign. It could be an eye movement, maybe looking to the right or left or down or up. It could be a smile. It could be a finger moving or a fist being made. It may even be them sticking their tongue out. I would start by focusing on parts of the body that may still show signs of control. You must become a detective and keep looking at various body parts for some sign. It may not happen the first time or even a second time. It may never happen and I could be wrong. But if I am right just think of the benefits that will come out of this for you and your love one.</p>
<p>Reassure them that you will continue to look for a signal and they should keep trying the best they can at their speed. Ask them a simple question like "do you love me? If yes lift your finger or lower your finger". Again you will need to keep quiet, and observe for at least two minutes. Keep doing this and try this with different parts of the body. They may not have control over certain parts, and that may be an issue. If you do see something make sure you point that out to them and ask them to do it again to insure they really are responding. If this turns out to work find a way to use that same body part to get yes or no responses from the person. Keep in mind that this may not always work and you may need to be creative. Maybe just keep the finger raised longer if they mean no, or tap it twice etc., but that may be too much to ask.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind if the person has not had any real dialog with someone for a long time this would also take more time. No matter what do not become discouraged, try this at least three different times on different days. Like I said this may never work and I have it wrong.</p>
<p>If this does work please reply to this site with your contact information so I can speak to you. If this works for a few it makes me believe that we need to treat these folks completely different to the way society treats them today. This will change so much about what people really believe is happening to our minds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at www.alz.org. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple on Friday, Sept. 21 for World Alzheimer's Month. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are counting on all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have visited many websites that talk about Alzheimer's/dementia. The one thing that they all have in common is that not one of them encourages those of us who have the disease to continue to live and enjoy our lives. While I realize AD is a progressive and devastating disease we are still here, we are still alive, so treat us that way. Do not write us off.</p>
<p>I have always been savvy when it comes to finances and have always been a saver. One day I was speaking to a friend of mine who has AD, and I was telling her how I did not want to spend a lot of the money I had saved, because I wanted to leave it for my wife for that rainy day. My friend told me: "This is the rainy day. What are you waiting for?" She was right, and that's exactly how I started to think.</p>
<p>Just because we are living with AD, does not mean we should curl up and think our life is over before it actually is. There is so much more we can still do to enjoy life. Make wonderful memories with your loved ones before the days turn ugly.</p>
<p>One thing I had always wanted was to own a convertible, so we purchased one. I wanted to drive it down to the Keys in Florida. I have a friend out in California who also has AD. She has an RV and had planned to travel around the country before she declined and was incapable of driving anymore. One day she mentioned that she was going to the Keys and I decided to meet up with her. I also wanted to go deep-sea fishing to catch a big game fish. Don't get me wrong I am not person who goes fishing, but it was something I have always wanted to do. I had looked into it and it was very pricy, but it has always been on my bucket list. I think we all have a list if we stop and think about it.</p>
<p>I had no real plans; I just wanted to go out and drive my convertible, to feel the fresh air and admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy nice weather. I had a great time. I had a permanent smile on my face. I decided to stay with my friend in the RV for a week and visit various campgrounds along the way. That was a whole new experience, and some of the places we stayed at had fabulous views.</p>
<p>It was great to be out on our own, not having to rely on caregivers all the time. We had some difficulties, but we were able to mange on our own. It cost me a few extra dollars along the way because when I purchased something I could not remember the price in order to be able to compare, and sometimes I took the wrong road and had to take the turnpike, but these were minor issues. This road trip made me feel so much better about me. It was good for my mind; I came back stronger because of what I had achieved.</p>
<p>This disease has a way of making you feel like you are no longer cable of doing things on your own. You lose your self-esteem and your self-confidence. After this trip I felt great.</p>
<p>I did have to opportunity to go fishing. It was such a beautiful day with perfect conditions. The fish were not really biting to begin with but it didn't matter I was just happy to be on a boat again. Then I caught a fish that was about 10-12 inches long. Then I caught a barracuda that was at least 18 inches long, and then one over two feet long. Not to long after that I got the big one, a king macro that was 42 inches long! You should have seen the smile on my face. It is memories like this that we need to be making.</p>
<p>My friend in the RV has decided that she will not just use her mother's china and silverware on special occasions. Instead she took them with her in the RV. It gives her pleasure to use them every day. How many of you have a wonderful expensive hand bag or nice watch, which you only use on a special occasion?</p>
<p>Life is short; take pleasure in using those treasured items now. Start to create your own bucket list, don't just write it, DO IT! There are many wonderful memories that you can still make. Make them now before it's too late. Stop focusing on the negative. Make these last few years be the best of your life. You must do this now, before your mind no longer works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Since being diagnosed with Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease I have dedicated much of my time to its advocacy. Over the years I have worked with many people in different parts of the world, and through my experience I have come to realize that a major problem in reaching a cure is our actions. The way we treat not only those who suffer from this disease but those who care for the afflicted, the focus on funding and research and the lack of communication and collective action. Although there are many brilliant people who are involved in Alzheimer's and Dementia action and research I feel that following some simple principals and plans we could bring about real change in the world of these diseases.</p>
<p>PARTICIPATION -- Patients, caregivers, family and friends must become advocates</p>
<p>FUNDING -- Unprecedented action from government and public sector is vital</p>
<p>TEAM WORK -- Organizations dedicated to fighting the cause must work together to reach a shared goal</p>
<p>RESEARCH -- It is imperative that professional medical research personnel work hand-in-hand with patients</p>
<p>LIVE -- Those suffering from the disease must learn to live happy and fulfilling lives</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> -- The government wants to hear from us! I have been doing this a long time and I am told over and over again by government officials that they need to have a clear idea of the numbers of people with Alzheimer's so they can make the appropriate changes to policy etc. In order for the government to do something they need to see people with the disease. I know people have busy lives but if we want things to change, patients, caregivers and friends need to start taking action.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By getting involved! Write to the people who can help - government, health officials, and the press. But be mindful that you have to be persistent with these people, you have to fight. Can you imagine the impact if even a small percentage of the millions of sufferers took a little time to have their say?</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong> -- We must look at other funding models for this disease. Unlike HIV and cancer, there are no survivors. Patients will continue to place a massive financial burden on the national economy; we need to be more proactive in how we fund research, care, medication and support for loved ones and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By writing to Congress, and the National Institute of Health. These people are responsible for prioritizing the distribution of funds to critical diseases - Alzheimer's disease is not on the list; we need it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM WORK</strong> -- There are many organizations out there hosting their individual fund raising programs, which is to be commended but the downside to this is that they still insist on operating independently on one another. These people need to see the bigger picture, they need to set aside their politics and differences, and come together as one and work together -- after all, they share the same goal don't they?</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? Well we can stop complaining about these organizations and give them solutions and guidance. Together we have the power to bring about change. Keep informed of all the latest news and action, don't listen to gossip or rumor -- check the facts; do your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen. I am living with Alzheimer's disease. I spend almost every waking hour advocating for increased funding for research that will improve the treatment of this dreadful disease. In 2008, at the age of 49, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms began at age 39. There are more than five million Americans now suffering from this devastating disease.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research into critical and devastating diseases such as cancer and HIV/Aids. Yet there is much neglect and discrimination regarding the allocation of funds for research into Alzheimer's and related dementias. As a person who experiences the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease every day I hope that research will lead eventually to postponing the onset or slow the progression of this disease, if not prevention and cure.</p>
<p>Currently, Alzheimer's disease only receives about $450 million for research from NIH, compared to more than $5 billion for cancer and more than $3 billion for HIV/AIDS. I am astonished at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing the number one health epidemic. Historically, leadership from the federal government has helped lower the number of deaths from major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, stroke and many types of cancers. This past experience provides hope that increased efforts directed at Alzheimer's disease will be met with similar success.</p>
<p>There are many more Americans living with Alzheimer's than HIV; more funding is desperately needed. If we do not act now this disease has the potential to bankrupt this country. Money allocated today will have an enormous return on investment if it leads to the kind of successes obtained for other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have not yet been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease it's just a matter of time. I hope that my advocacy will help prevent future generations having to suffer my fate and that of many others. You can help by increasing NIH funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>I appeal to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the respective appropriations committees: Make the hard choices; increase funding for Alzheimer's disease. Do everything necessary to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gets the exposure, commitment and funding necessary to change the course of the disease before millions more Americans are affected.</p>
<p>My work as an advocate has provided opportunities to share my story on a national platform. I have provided public comment during meetings of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services in addition to having my personal essay about overcoming the stigma of the disease featured in the Alzheimer's disease World Report 2012. I have also become a member of the Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisory Group, helping to raise awareness of the disease and provide insights on the most appropriate programs and services for individuals in the early stage of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>I hope that what I am doing now will allow me to leave this world knowing that I have done everything possible to make generations to come have a fighting chance. Do not forget these people or the future generations who will develop this disease. We face dying in the worst possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As an Alzheimer's patient, I find it very difficult to perform tasks that I was once very capable of performing. Sometimes I am better than other times at doing the same task. People around me have accepted this fact and have tried to be very forgiving when I run into issues doing a task or when just trying to remember something. I really think that people around me should challenge me more at times.</p>
<p>For example, many of my doctors kept questioning me about whether or not I should still be driving. This of course was mentioned to my wife who also started wondering. I finally had a driving test a few years later. It was recommended that I no longer drive, even though I passed the test. I was almost borderline, but there was concern that I may not recognize when I become worse and could then become a danger. First of all, I have to tell you that the test they performed was not fair. I wonder how many regular people would be able to pass this test. The test also relied on me to learn new things in order to take the test. That is not fair since I have been driving the same vehicle all this time and nothing has changed. This constant talk about my driving has totally killed all of my self-esteem about driving. Every time I was in the car on the road with my wife, she constantly pointed out any mistakes I made, and her reaction time was much quicker than mine. I do realize I am a bit slower in my response time, but that is why I give myself more space between the other cars. Sometimes I am very far back or I just don't want to go around that slow car. There is nothing wrong with not feeling comfortable to go around that person. Let me do it at my speed.</p>
<p>I see many people on the road that I feel are so much worse than me and I wonder why they are still on the road, if I am supposedly so bad. I decided that I was going to drive to visit my daughter in South Carolina. I live in Jamison, PA in Bucks County. I was very scared to take this trip but I was trying to prove something to myself. It could have meant the end of my driving if I made a serious mistake along the way. I drove in one day, about 700 miles, with the help of a GPS in my car. The more I drove, the more I was starting to feel comfortable behind the wheel. A few other people on the road made serious mistakes along the way and I easily avoided a possible accident. This trip was the best thing I could have done for myself. I now have almost all of my self-confidence back and my wife no longer makes constant comments about my driving, unless I have a real issue. I have now had two close calls that required quick thinking and maneuvering to avoid an accident. In both cases, I was able to avoid the issues without my wife's comments. Again it may have taken me an extra second or two to react, but I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Coping Strategies for Daily Challenges </strong></p>
<p>Because of this situation, I feel even stronger than ever that it is important to be challenged. I know it may be easier for you to do something for an Alzheimer's patient because it's much quicker for you to accomplish the task. But I really believe that if you take the time to coach us along the way, we may do better in the long run. Believe me, I know it's got to be very aggravating at times, but I really appreciate it. It takes a lot of patience on the part of the helper. Everyone is different and you need to know at what point in time you should not push. It's also hard to be patient and not raise your voice at the person you are trying to help, because it will only make it worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering dates or things I need to do.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use my computer and Microsoft Outlook to keep me straight by sending me reminders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Getting email using regular places like Google or Yahoo is a challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My daughter had set up my Outlook to retrieve emails from all my accounts, and they arrive in the same format which makes it so much easier to read, and it allows me to use common folders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I forget to reply back to people's emails.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I flag them with a reminder date so it will automatically send me a reminder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Remembering passwords is a real challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have created a personal system that works great, I also rely on the computer to store many of them; however, it is a real challenge when the system does not work. I also keep files with the password information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering the day, the month and the year.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have watch that displays all the information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have an extremely complex TV, stereo and entertainment system, which requires many remotes and settings to be used.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I purchased a smart remote that allows me to put in all the steps at once, and press one button which takes care of sending all the commands to all the devices at once. It works great until it fails. Not sure how much longer I can maintain it. It's a bit involved</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Most of my lawn power tools are a struggle to use.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not think I have any coping method other then I keep trying different things until I get them to work. The problem is most are new, I find it easier to work with tools I am familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I drive I don't always feel as comfortable behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I sometimes need to take more precautions, and allow more distance between the car in front of me, and I may drive a little slower. I am also much more alert and focused during these times. It makes it hard because when I travel with my wife she wonders why all of sudden I drive slower, when normally I am flying. There is nothing wrong with going slower and being cautious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I don't do much of anything anymore.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The other day I was speaking with my neighbor who was waxing his car. This gave me some inspiration to want to do it. When people mention things to me it sometimes gives me what I need to take it to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I purchased a camera; however, no matter how many times I read the manual I still don't seem to be able to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: Make sure you buy one that works completely automatic without needing to do anything. It is frustrating at times when you would like to do something on your own but just can't remember on how to do it. I have learned to accept it but I still try and fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Spelling and forming sentences has become a real challenge.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take advantage of using the computer to guide me in the correct spelling of a word. That is becoming harder because often it cannot figure out what I am trying to say. I also ask others to look things over for me, and to correct them for me. It's kind of frustrating for me because I am really concerned that I may not be able to do this much longer. I have seen a big decline in this over the years. I seem to notice this more than my other skills because I do it so often. While I am sometimes ashamed of sharing it with others, I still need to communicate so I try to not think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Sometimes when I want to do certain things I need to stop and think.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: If I want to work on a project I will spend a lot of extra time trying to think of the best approach, this doesn't always help, but I tend to work at a slightly slower pace and am aware that things will go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Finding past emails or letters</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The computer is such a wonderful tool in so many ways. It allows me to search the entire computer as long as I can remember a word or two in the document I am looking for. While it may take a while I would not be able to survive without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer do many things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I rely on my wife for many things nowadays. I am not sure if that is a coping strategy. When anything important needs to be considered, I ask her for her help. She does all the financials, and planning of most things. It is frustrating but I realize I cannot do it on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I get lost or cannot figure out how to get from one place to another. Maps are not easy to follow anymore even the ones that you print out from Google.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: GPS! I cannot imagine what it was like for people like me before GPS and the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear that one day I will be lost or not be able to communicate with others due to a temporary stress or decline in my mental capacity.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have chosen to not be concerned about that. I have a medical tag on me all the time that has my medical condition along with important contact information. I will continue to go wherever I want to go. I realize I will need to rely on others to get there. I will need to ask others for help frequently, and to ask multiple times so others don't send me down the wrong path. It will take me longer to get there, but I cannot let that stop me. Living in fear is also no way to live. I know there are good people that will help me when the time comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Some things I do get me very frustrated</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I no longer try to do those things so I do not get frustrated</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I write notes as reminders</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I only write a few notes as if I have too many they just become overwhelming, and I would lose track of them because there are too many.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I need more time to do things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I leave much earlier for meetings and places so I can allow for issues along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: If I start to get frustrated doing something.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I move on to something else and then I try to come back and do it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear I may get lost when I go to new and far places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take a cell phone with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I go shopping and lose track of the person I am with I sometimes start to worry a little bit.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to calm myself down and look for them. If I cannot find them I will try to stay by the door we came in so I can see them at that register</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My wife added masking tape with a marking pointing to off. No more issues. I have the feeling that over time I will need many reminders like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble hearing people speak in loud places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to not go to restaurants or other places where I will be put in that situation if I can help it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer use my video recorder.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I now have TiVo which makes it so much easier to do things. I still need some help, and my wife can help when I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I try to communicate with much smarter people.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I believe that my reaching out to and working with people who are very smart will delay the deterioration process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I cut the grass, or do something that requires me to be a bit more stable on my feet.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use a good pair of shoes, or even a low cut boot. It really helps me become more stable on my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I could get hurt while doing yard work.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not wear lose clothes or short sleeved clothes when doing yard work so I do not get hurt. Wearing shorts has already led to a broken foot because the pants leg got caught on the shifter. I also wear safety glasses. The problem I have is I don't always remember to take these precautions, or sometimes I think it's not necessary because I feel I will be careful if I am doing something that will just take a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Just the other day I was thinking in my head that I had to turn a grate on my fireplace, and I was thinking it may be hot.</p>
<p><strong>No Coping Strategy</strong>: Instead of being careful and just putting one finger closely to feel for heat, I just tried to touch it with three fingers to lift -- I got burned. How do you get a copping strategy for becoming stupid? It seems that my mind is not communicating with the rest of my body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: All the people around me know I have AD, so most of them are keeping an extra eye out on me which is nice to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to keep some type of a schedule. I get up every day at the same time and try to eat at the same time. This kind of helps to do things like taking my drugs or other things. The second I change my routine you can be sure I will forget to take my drugs or do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I double and triple check myself on many things I do. Daily Challenge: ???? Coping Strategy: I try to find some humor in my issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ?????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I ask people for help and ask a lot more questions of others</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take lots of breaks</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to know my limits and will not start a task if I feel I cannot do it. Or I will have someone work with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A few months ago one of my friends mentioned that I am always talking about things related to Alzheimer's. While I know I spend my days advocating for this disease I did not realize I was that bad. Especially with those I am not trying to convince or influence. Although I appreciate the person telling me, it has really bothered me.</p>
<p>I started to give it some thought and tried to understand why and what I could do to change that. Not too long after that my wife made a similar comment, and that really hit home because their comments to me were so close together.</p>
<p>I realized many things have contributed to this. The most important is I no longer work and I feel like I am locked in this house; I really have nothing else to do. I wish I could still be working and doing something meaningful, but unfortunately my skills required to perform those jobs are no longer there because of my Alzheimer's. I use to go to work, I used to talk with others about many different topics, not just work but everyday world issues.</p>
<p>I have tried to have similar conversations with people about issues in the news, and I don't always have the right information since I don't always understand it all, and only retain bits and pieces. While there was a time I was a news junkie, now I can rarely recall many of the topics or even can tie other stories together in my mind so I can speak intelligently. I have recently found myself starting discussions that go south because I start out with part of a subject, and when we delved into it deeper I was at loss for information. I felt stupid because I could no longer speak about something I once found very easy. I used to be great about talking about political issues which really requires you to know what you are talking about, but now I can barely defend my position, and I do worse for even bringing the subject up, and then I feel bad because I was not able to point out the real issues so the person could really make a true assessment.</p>
<p>Since I have no real job I have made it my mission to advocate for Alzheimer/dementia. I try to keep my mind as engaged as possible. I also try to focus on things that most don't, like the high hanging fruit which is probably not the best for some on like me. That involves dealing with many high-level people. While I do good at first I don't always have the answers they require, and sometimes may come across as not knowing what I am doing. It is very frustrating knowing that in my brain I have the answers, but I just do not know how to retrieve the information needed to help me do what I need to do. Especially when I need it the most, I may remember later on sometimes, but it's too late. There was a time that I could retrieve everything to my favor and keep track of everything one person would say to me.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I listen to the weather report multiple times a day and I never seem to know what the weather is supposed to be like, which I always use to know. I just do not seem to retain it.</p>
<p>I use to like reading the paper and I no longer do that because I have trouble retaining what I read or I don't remember how the story relates to something I read a few paragraphs back in the same article.</p>
<p>I used to have hobbies that I can no longer do because of the disease. I use to love boating and tinkering with electronics. I can no longer do any of these things. I rarely do anything around the house because I am afraid I will make it worse.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with others I do not always remember what we have spoken about in the past. I always hated it when you spoke to certain people and they keep repeating the same information you had spoken about in the past. I do not want to become one of them. There are so many discussions I want to have but I just can't because the lack of my ability and more. I miss that so much. To have an intelligent conversation with someone that can reply with meaningful information, where we both walked away with some new and interesting facts would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I was never one to blow my own horn, but I do that today so others can see some of the steps I have made in hopes that they feel they are willing to take risks and help me expand my mission.</p>
<p>I have accomplished some great things and I think that is what I may share with my friends. Maybe I am repeating myself and I don't know it. I keep trying to figure out how I can change, but I struggle because I do not know what to do. It seems that Alzheimer's has taken over my life and not sure what or how to change.</p>

					Meeting July 19th 2013</strong></p>
<p>Please see below the HHS 2013 recommendations and National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners and International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners recommendations for items pertaining to HHS numbers 14, 16, 18, 21 and 22 and education related items.</p>
<p>HHS 14: Develop a unified curriculum for primary care practitioners to become more knowledgeable about AD and enhance the skills necessary to deliver dementia capable care.</p>
<p>HHS 16: Form a blue ribbon panel of experts on advanced dementia to develop innovations in clinical care practice and quality, including palliative care, for people with advanced dementia.</p>
<p>HHS 18: States should assure that they have robust, dementia capable LTSS systems.</p>
<p>HHS 21: State education and health agencies and others should include key information about AD in all curricula for any profession or career track affecting LTSS.</p>
<p>HHS 22: State, local and private sector organizations should ensure that paraprofessional caregivers in every venue are adequately trained and compensated.</p>
<p>National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners NCCDP / International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners ICCDP Recommendations:</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that the HHS include in the July 19th 2013 meeting of NAPA recommendations;</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that Alzheimer's disease and dementia education be provided by a Certified Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Trainer who has completed at minimum 12 hours of dementia education by a national training company who provides training for in-service directors and trainers, a Train the Trainer program that includes but not limited to; dementia / Alzheimer's disease overview, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, medications, behaviors, wandering, hoarding, sexuality, cultural diversity, nutrition, death and dying issues, types of dementia, depression, etc.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners and International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners are added to the list of organizations that provide dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that dementia education be required of all health care professionals and front line staff which includes but not limited to Physicians, Medical Directors, Pharmacists, Consultants, Activity Professionals, Recreation Specialists, Administrators, Assistant Administrators, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Speech Therapists, Nurses, Nursing Assistants, Personal Care Assistants, Home Health Aides, Dietitians, Social Workers, Clergy, Dietary Workers, Universal Workers, Housekeepers, Maintenance Workers, Security Guards, Bus Drivers, Mental Health Workers, MDS Coordinators, etc., All health care workers and front line staff who are currently working in Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Adult Day care, CCRC, Hospitals, Home Care Agencies, , Hospice Agencies, Management Companies, Hospitals, Rehab Centers, Memory Centers, Boarding Homes, Adult Foster Homes, Senior Centers, Independent Living, HUD Housing, Shared Housing and any other geriatric setting and that the dementia education at minimum will consists of 12 hours of LIVE dementia education and an additional LIVE 8 hours that includes abuse and neglect and presented LIVE by Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainers</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that all new staff (new hires) are required to have this education prior to beginning work or assignments.</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that all employees who work in any health care industry such as; associations, aging government office such as the Ombudsman, Office On Aging, State Offices who have Surveyor's, etc., are all required to have a minimum of 12 hours live dementia education at minimum and an additional LIVE 8 hours of education that includes abuse and neglect and presented LIVE by Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainers</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that all learning institutions, trade schools, universities and two year colleges who provide any type of health care curriculum such as Nursing Assistant, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapist, Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist, Social Work, Nursing, Physician, Pharmacist, Dietitian, etc., either as a certificate program, registry program, licensing program or a degree degree will be required to provide 12 hours of dementia education and 8 hours of abuse and neglect classes prior to graduating from the program. NCCDP is recommending that the dementia education be taught live by a Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainer.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommend mandatory 6 hours minimum of dementia education for all First Responders which includes but not limited to Law Enforcement, EMT's and Fire Fighters because they are often the first professional in the home during a crisis and they need dementia education so they are equipped to respond to a confused or disoriented individual. NCCDP recommends the education is provided by a NCCDP Certified First Responder Dementia Trainer CFRDT.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that the health care professional, front line staff and organization have the ability to select which company, college, trade school or private trainer to provide the Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and no one should be forced to select from a pared down list of a few institutions regardless of the organization private or nonprofit status. The public should make a choice based on the reputation, experience and knowledge of the organization presenting the dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS put together a comprehensive list of institutions, technical colleges, organizations, consulting companies, private trainers and companies who provide Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and companies should be allowed to add their name to the list of providers with no endorsement from HHS. HHS should not recommend nor endorse one organization, trade school, university, private trainer, etc over another.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS not put any kind of stipulation on a training program nor require that a training program be evidenced based. HHS should recommend what topics a comprehensive curriculum includes.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR be expanded to include more information and resources for health care professionals to utilize rather than develop another national repository.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR provide a list of USA and international organizations of what they provide and products, resources, learning materials, assessments currently available and includes but not limited to state organizations, institutions, organizations, companies, etc.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that no money be put aside for HHS to develop a national Alzheimer's disease and dementia repository when ADEAR already exists.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that more organizations that are providing Alzheimer's disease and dementia training are added to the NAPA sub committees.</p>

<p>While I agree with some of your statements and there is a flaw. The flaw is not thought my ideas, but the system we created. Many of us think they are god and have the right to make decision for everyone else and they do not look past the religion aspect of things. The perfect world would be based on having doctors put me out based on taken a certain score on the 30 question MMI test (or whatever you call it) they always give you. I am not sure what the number would be, but probably about 15 - 20. That of course would require much more involvement from my doctors so I could truly understand what that all means. It should also be based at taking that test 3 separate times at different times of the day, with at least a week in between. That would all be based by my original request when I was still capable of making a sound decision. I would be happy to discuss it with anyone interested in speaking about it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Why physician-assisted suicide/dying cannot help patients who have dementia</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Ellenbogen brings up an important point, one that concerns many people who worry about dementia: Briefly: Is there a way for them to exit in a dignified way that is also timely?</p>
<p>Mr. Ellenbogen expressed this fear well, and I feel compassion for him. His stated problem begs for an effective solution. Yet the one he proposed is seriously flawed from several points of view: the clinical, practical, ethical, moral, and psychological, as well as legal.</p>
<p>The points of agreement and the one point of disagreement that I have with Michael Ellenbogen is within his key paragraph that I copied below and then respond to, point-by-point, by adding my specific comments:</p>
<p>Mr. Ellenbogen wrote: "You need to make plans when you are still able to think clearly. You must figure out a method so you know what to do when the time comes. The scary part for me is knowingwhen the right time may be. You do not want to go earlier then you have to, but you do not want to wait until the point where you may not be able to decide to do it, or remember how to do it. <strong>That is why I am a true believer in assisted suicide</strong>. It would be nice to let someone know my wishes far in advance, and when we get to that point they would instruct me on what I had to do. This way, my family and I could get the most out of my life without question."</p>
<p>First a general comment: Mr. Ellenbogen expresses what I have been calling the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>," when he writes: "You do not want to wait until the point where you may not be able to decide to do it, or remember how to do it," since by the word, "IT," he really means suicide. More typical is this blunter statement: "If I don't kill myself now (<strong>when I can</strong>), I won't be able to kill myself later (<strong>when I want to</strong>)." The consequence of acting on this fear is "premature dying," which violates the principle of the sanctity/preciousness of life. This is the problem for which Mr. Ellenbogen is searching for a solution.</p>
<p>Now, point-by-point:</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "You need to make plans while you still have the mental capacity to make end of life treatment decision." Let me add: One way to do this is to create a clear and specific Living Will and to appoint a proxy/agent whom you trust to make sure that others will honor the wishes you previously expressed in your Living Will. The document designates your proxy/agent must give the appointed individuals sufficient power to facilitate your last wishes.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "You need to figure out a method so you know what to do." To respond: My personal choice, and what I advise my patients to consider is to forgo the continuation of another person's hand to assist oral feeding and drinking. This is what I have been calling "Natural Dying." Important: food and fluid are always placed near enough to reach so that if you regained the ability to eat independently, you could. Forgoing treatment that has become extraordinary or disproportionate is both legal and moral.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "The scary part is knowing when the right time may be." Appreciating that you will lose the ability to decide on that time later means you must make this decision while you still can. The goal of TIMELY DYING is possible if you can trust your proxy/agent and your future physician to engage in the process of "shared decision-making." Then, someday, they will compare your future condition with the decisions you expressed in your clear and specific Living Will to decide if it is time for "Natural Dying."</p>
<p>Important: Assisted suicide is not legal for patients who have dementia, even in Oregon, Washington, or Switzerland. While legal in theory, it is very rarely practiced in Holland because physicians do not feel comfortable killing a patient who cannot <em>contemporaneously</em> express the wish to die. Dutch physicians also do not feel comfortable killing a patient whose major issue is their anticipatory fear of greater suffering and burdens <em>in the future</em>; they insist that patients have unbearable suffering which cannot be relieved in any way other than by dying--which is NOT the case for patients in the early or middle stages of dementia. Even for patients who had such terminal diseases as cancer or neurological diseases (which comprise the majority of patients who used Oregon's "Death With Dignity Act"), only 600 people died this way since 1997. Compare this number to the one to two million people who currently are suffering in the advanced stage of dementia--a number that will triple by mid-century. Thus, physician-assisted dying cannot be a practical, legal, or ethical answer for a prolonged dying with much suffering for patients who reach the stage of advanced dementia.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "It would be nice to let someone know my wishes far in advance..." and "This way, my family and I could get the most out of my life without question." This laudable goal can be accomplished by effective Advance Care Planning.</p>
<p>But now, a resounding NO, I do NOT agree: "When we get to that point they would instruct me on what I had to do" (e.g., how to commit suicide). Your family members would risk being indicted for a serious crime with severe penalties. They are also likely to suffer from greater moral angst and grief, if they actively helped you die when they were not sure about--as you put it "when the right time... when [I] get to that point." The best way to reduce the emotional burdens on families is to create your gift of a clear, specific Living Will and to make it clear that you are responsible for the ultimate existential decision, not them.</p>
<p>Let me end with a personal note to Michael Ellenbogen: I am sorry you have the diagnosis of dementia. I am glad that you are still functioning at such a high level. Unfortunately, you cannot be sure, just because each dementia patient is different, just how long you will retain your ability to exercise good judgment about end-of-life medical decisions. Now, you do. Someday... unless you die of another disease first, the irreversible, progressive disease of dementia will likely deprive you of that good judgment. (Perhaps an exception is a very well controlled vascular dementia that remains stable.) This is the reason why it is so important that you make your decisions, memorialize them, and appoint surrogates to facilitate them NOW. It would be an enormous shame and waste of your good life, if you were to commit suicide prematurely, just because you still possessed the mental capacity to make medical decisions. I hope you live as long and as well as possible.</p>
<p>Conflict of interest statement: Stanley A. Terman, PhD, MD, has written three books on this subject and created a deck of illustrated cards that people, even those in early dementia, can use to generate a clear and specific Living Will if they want to attain the goal of a timely and peaceful dying. (The books are "The <em>BEST WAY</em> to Say Goodbye: A Legal Peaceful Choice at the End of Life," "Peaceful Transitions: Stories of Success and Compassion," and "Peaceful Transitions: Plan Now, Die Later--Ironclad Strategy"; the cards are "My Way Cards for Natural Dying" or "Natural Dying Living Will Cards." Dr. Terman is the founder and Medical Director of Caring Advocates, a non-profit organization.)</p>

<p>I am writing to you out of frustration to the letter of Stanley A. Terman, PhD, MD, dated, March 26 2012. While I do not know what his credentials are, I can assure you 100% without doubt that he does not have any understanding of what Alzheimer's patients are capable of doing or not doing. While I have heard from all the smart doctors make the statement that if you know one Alzheimer's patient, you only know one as for their symptoms go.</p>
<p>While I may have trouble writing, speaking, do financing and many of the other things I so dearly miss, I am very capable of making very good judgments. In fact I still help many people who do not have dementia to help them with decisions they are unable to make.</p>
<p>Some people like to be in the public spot light for the wrong reasons, which is the case for this individual. If you are going to make statements, you should understand all sides, not just a one side point of view, maybe perhaps poor judgment on his part.</p>
<p>My wife feels that she would have no problem taking care of me all the way to the end. Since she happens to be an RN she feels she could take off for a year to become my private nurse, if and when I became bad. But I have many fears of reaching that point in my life. First of all, I do not want to be remembered as the person who could no longer talk or take care of himself. I want to leave this world with dignity and not make others feel better about themselvesbecause they kept me around to the end. I do not want to frustrate and burden their lives any more than I have. While we have had a great life, those are the thoughts I want to leave my wife with. I also hope that she finds someone new in her life so she can move on. My daughter lives in another state and I do not want her to feel obligated to move back, close to home, just to help her mother. I do not think my wife realizes what a major undertaking this is. While she may be good at what she does, she cannot handle this type of pressure.</p>
<p>Then of course, I do not want to suffer and be tortured for the rest of my life. There are many times, on a daily basis, when I am not always clear on what I need to do to make myself more comfortable or not suffer from pain. In the middle of the night, while sleeping, I become uncomfortable because I'm hot, so I flip the covers off my feet and feel so much better. A few hours go by, and now my feet are cold, so I replace the blanket. Now imagine that you are hot, and there is no way to remove that blanket. I would go crazy because I could not do that and would suffer. That is exactly what would happen if I could no longer do or think for myself.</p>
<p>My wife seems to think that those types of issues would not bother me. Who really knows? However, I do not want to be the one to find out and suffer. Sure, she can want to think it will not happen, for her peace of mind, but what about me?</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. I have major allergy problems and I constantly have a postnasal drip. Its major impact to me is at night and I frequently wake up gagging and coughing in an effort to clear my nose and throat. Sometimes I can waste 45 minutes before I finally resolve the issue. I actually suffer today and feel tortured at times. Can you imagine if that happens to me and I cannot let someone know what's bothering me and cannot do anything for myself. That frightens me to no end. My allergist has run out of options with me. This problem has really become much worse this year.</p>
<p>One last example. I am particular about how my pillow feels when I go to sleep. I like it to be very fluffed up. Usually once during the night I tend to flip it so that I get the fluffed end again, and it feels so much better when I do that.</p>
<p>People may tell you to wait until it gets worse, but they are wrong. You need to make plans when you are still able to think clearly. You must figure out a method so you know what to do when the time comes. The scary part for me is knowing when the right time may be. You do not want to go earlier then you have to, but you do not want to wait until the point where you may not be able to decide to do it, or remember how to do it. That is why I am a true believer in assisted suicide. It would be nice to let someone know my wishes far in advance, and when we get to that point they would instruct me on what I had to do. This way, my family and I could get the most out of my life without question.</p>
<p>There are many other reasons I can go into, but I need to go to a funeral for a family member who final passed away after years of torture. He finally passed from Parkinson Disease the other day. He was zombie and scared and had no life. He had living will that was over ridden because some family member was going to have a wedding and they decide to put feeding tube in when he would have probably died in another day or two. Now that is poor judgment from people like you.</p>

<p>I am very impressed by the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (and Related Dementias). It is well written and quite comprehensive from my perspective. But I do have some concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in February 2010. I am her primary caregiver and health advocate. Fortunately, long-term care insurance has afforded us the opportunity to have two very good caregivers thus providing me the ability to work part time as a research scientist at CNA, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). My wife and I have experienced both the classical, traditional clinical medical approach and, more recently, the alternative complementary medical approach. In addition, I am a member of two caregiver support groups: one offered by a Ministry to the Aging at my church, and the second offered by the Alzheimer's Family Day Center of Fairfax, VA.</p>
<p>From this base of experience and education, I offer my observations and suggestions:</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan seems to lack a sense of urgency</strong>. While the goal "to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025" is laudable, the selection of 2025 along with the general tone of the plan does not convey the urgency I believe is necessary. Selecting either 2020, because it's sooner and a nice round number, or 2022, as it comes 10-years after the release of the National Plan and is akin to President Kennedy's announcement in 1960 of manned flight to the moon by the end of that decade, would be better. Both years signal a message of boldness and ambition more so than does 2025. I believe caregivers and family members would be encouraged by such ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>The plan appears to display certain biases that may restrict the search for alternative solutions</strong>.
<ol><li>First, there seems to be an emphasis on searching for "pharmacological" solutions. Certainly, the plan recognizes other approaches, e.g. "While research on AD has made steady progress, there are no pharmacological or <em>other interventions</em> to definitively prevent, treat, or cure the disease" and "<em>non-pharmacological management</em> of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms." But it does not clearly state what such "other, non-pharmacological" approaches might be. This suggests to me a bias toward pharmaceutical solutions and therefore a favoring of the pharmaceutical industry, which seems to be more motivated by profits than solutions. I encourage that these other approaches be specified. The effectiveness of public health communications necessitates clear, plain-English language.</li>
<li>There also seems to be a bias toward the time-consuming approach of clinical trials. The plan clearly recognizes the need to the pharmaceutical bias, I think.</li>
<li>The plan rightly includes "related dementias" in defining Alzheimer's Disease. But it identifies only Lewy body, frontotemporal, and vascular dementias as examples. Unless recognized but not stated by the drafters, I suggest including other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS/Lew Gehrig, and MS. Such an expansion might introduce synergies and efficiencies and potentially a considerably more significant effect.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>Admittedly, my own personal research into AD is limited. I have only recently begun to dig more deeply into the subject. Much of my motivation comes from frustration over the silence and apparent helplessness of the traditional medical community toward my wife's disease. I have recently read two books that have strongly influenced me: "Alzheimer's Disease---What If There Was a Cure"---The Story of Ketones" by Dr. Mary Newport, and "Stop Alzheimer's Now! How to Prevent and Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders" by Dr. Bruce Fife.These books introduced me to the "Type 3 Diabetes" aspect of AD, which I find most intriguing and compelling. If what they say is true about insulin-deficiency and insulin-resistance in the brain and the resultant "starvation" of neurons, and that nutritional substitutes in the form of ketone bodies from medium-chain triglyceride fatty acids already exist on the shelves of health food stores in the forms of coconut oil and MCT oils, THIS IS HUGE. Considering that I might be "starving" my wife's neurons by not providing this source of fuels (already used by neonatologists, according to Dr. Newport and in pediatrics, according to my RN daughter), ignoring this evidence is morally unconscionable to me. Also if true, this nutritional approach could be a "silver bullet" of vast consequence.</p>
<p>Thank you for soliciting comments from the public in reaction to the draft plan. I apologize for missing the March 30 deadline. Such tardiness has become commonplace for me as an Alzheimer's caregiver and health advocate. And thank you for your contribution to this important work.</p>

<p>This is an excellent document and we applaud your initiative and efforts to make this comprehensive and inclusive. It is with that objective in mind that we make the following observations:</p>
<p>Under Action 1.B.5 you note the importance of clinical trials on "Pharmacologic interventions." In B.6. you mention the importance of these for "lifestyle interventions."However, another <strong>key area</strong> is <strong>dietary or nutritional interventions</strong>. While this is often assumed by some under lifestyle, it is <strong>not always understood as such</strong>, especially by the public, and in light of recent research seems significant enough to warrant it's own mention. At least in terms of prevention, diet and nutrition is arguably <strong>at least as important</strong>, if not much more so, than any pharmaceutical intervention yet devised. (see evidence below). The rationale for it not being assumed under lifestyle is as follows:</p>
<p>Dictionary.com defines lifestyle as: <em>the habits, attitudes, tastes, moral standards, economic level, etc., that together constitute the mode of living of an individual or group</em>.</p>
<p>While tastes may imply dietary choices, that's not necessarily so, as they could imply one's taste for clothing, cars, companionship, etc., which do not equate to food or nutritional choices.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com provides this example of it's use in a sentence: <em>Much of what we're told about diet, <strong>lifestyle</strong> and disease is based on epidemiologic studies</em>.</p>
<p>Here you see they clearly do not consider "diet" to be synonymous with "lifestyle."</p>
<p>Perhaps this oversight, or confounding of the variables, is due to the heavily biased and fretfully flawed FDA tendency to lump anything therapeutic under the heading of pharmaceutical or "drug." That however is confusing and misleading to the public, and we feel a disservice to the thousands of great scientists who have worked and are working with nutrition and nutritional formulas -- many of whom your agencies have funded, who in the past <strong>have made better inroads</strong> into preventing or arresting AD symptoms than the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, Dr. William Grant in his landmark epidemiological study of "what causes Alzheimer's," including studies from 11 different countries, argued strongly that Alzheimer's disease was "primarily caused" not by genetics, which you pay great attention to, but by <strong>unhealthy dietary choices</strong>.[1] Moreover, the experimental peer reviewed studies, also show that findings in the field of nutrition have been more promising to date,[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] at least for the prevention of Alzheimer's than the much more costly pharmaceutical trials. It is logically inconsistent therefore to emphasize pharmaceutical trials in the context of prevention and neglect to even use the words <strong>diet, nutrition</strong> or exercise in this proposal.</p>
<p>So, wouldn't it be appropriate in light of the above noted research, to include here "nutritional" or "dietary" in para 1.B.6 before "lifestyle" as the dictionary has above. In other words to note "the importance of clinical trials on nutritional or dietary interventions." And encourage the FDA to expedite the approval, implementation and public awareness of positive outcomes in these areas, instead of dragging their feet as they historically have done, in this area. Or worse yet proposing a moratorium on new formulations, as they recently have proposed. (If you would like evidence of this let me know.)</p>
<p>We recommend, as you discuss prevention and early intervention, that you <strong>at least</strong> make mention of the fact that Alzheimer's is seen by many good researchers as a condition of elderly malnutrition,[10], [11] and there is a great deal of good research, such as that conducted by Dr. Suzanne Craft at the University of Washington, which the Alzheimer's 'Association highlighted in their 2010 ICAD conference and in their HBO series, which suggests that healthy foods and the nutrients they contain, may be <strong>among the most</strong> important factors to consider in our efforts to prevent Alzheimer's. In fact in that video she notes that by following some simple dietary guidelines people "could at the least delay the onset of Alzheimer's" and by doing so "reduce the number of Alzheimer's cases nearly in half" -- thus enabling you to achieve your objective.</p>
<p>Of course we're just using Dr. Craft as an example. In fact that Assoc and NIH have sponsored many good studies which suggest that various nutrients, like folic acid, grape seed and other antioxidants, key amino acids, etc can make a major dent in preventing Alzheimer's. Remember the famous Cache Senior memory study where they found that high consumption of antioxidants -- C and E "reduced AD prevalence by about 78% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 - 0.60) and incidence by about 64% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09 - 0.99)."[12] Then there were the Chicago fish studies5 and the MIDAS study presented in the 2009 ICAD conference which showed fish and DHA's potential to reduce risk by more than half. And we could go on -- see the references noted above.</p>
<p>You get our point. If you are going to specify pharmaceutical and lifestyle trials, we feel you should also note dietary or nutritional trials.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is a traumatic way to end one's sacred time here on this planet. The disease is paralleled with strong (negative) personality shifts and loss of memory related cognitive abilities in all types of memory. Further fueling this disease is the social treatment of it. Family members interact cautiously, and the person suffering Alzheimer's disease often witnesses their social structures disappear. My grandma, who suffers Alzheimer's, has been fighting with my grandfather for two years now, convinced that he is slyly stealing all of her things. My grandfather cannot even be in the same room alone with her anymore without being emotionally trampled. This is not her, and this is not the person my whole family grew up with. This has happened with both my grandmothers.</p>
<p>This needs to be dealt with, and it can. Research has identified many of the neural and microbiological mechanisms behind this neurodegenerative disease. If we can learn to cure this, that would be amazing. However, more funding can allow us to really treat it, which involves both traditional AND preventative medicine. Education of our public is highly important. Teaching appropriate and healthy behaviors (nutrition, physical AND mental exercise, having social relationships, etc.) which are highly linked to prevention are important. Funding of projects both in research and education is of extreme importance, especially given the future financial costs all of us will be covering for these individuals.</p>
<p>It is our national duty to fix this. Please take the necessary steps forward! Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p><strong>Entry Citation: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lombardo, Nancy B. Emerson. "Alzheimer's Disease." <em>Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health</em>. Ed. James M. Rippe, MD. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2012. 120-42. <em>SAGE Reference Online</em>. Web. 29 Feb. 2012. 6000 words on-line accessed 2 29 2012 </strong></p>
<p>This entry (a) describes the evolving definition of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease (AD) and its prevalence; (b) summarizes evidence for nutrition, physical exercise, and other healthy lifestyle interventions that may delay onset, prevent occurrence, or slow the progression of AD and other dementias and maintain the emotional and physical health of both the person with dementia and his or her care partners; (c) identifies key lifestyle strategies for preserving brain health--both cognitive and emotional--and how they may be related to body health strategies; and (d) highlights some clinical trial results and introduces a groundbreaking multi-domain study under way in Finland and the body of evidence leading to this seminal trial.</p>
<p>Readers may take away confirmation of the importance of some of the things they are already doing and gain ideas and motivation to adopt brain-healthy nutrition and lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle </strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD.

<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid. (Bayer-Carter JL et al. 2011).</p>

<p>On behalf of the Area Planning and Services Committee (APSC) on Aging with Lifelong Disabilities, I am sending a letter in response to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute our thoughts and congratulate you and the council on its initiative. Best wishes,</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Area Planning and Services Committee (APSC) on Aging with Lifelong Disabilities, which I serve as chairman, respectfully wishes to make comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The APSC is a regional coalition comprised of some two dozen organizational and individual members from Chesterfield, Hanover, and Henrico counties and the city of Richmond, Virginia, representing intellectual disabilities, parks and recreation, residential services, blindness and visual impairment, communities of faith, higher education, family caregivers, and more.</p>
<p>The APSC works to address both the opportunities and challenges that present themselves as more adults with lifelong disabilities grow into later life. In effect, the APSC acts as a creative form of <em>de facto</em> public policy, trying to respond in the present to issues that formal regulations have not yet incorporated. For instance, how can aging-related services that are offered only to adults ages 60 and above respond to persons with lifelong disabilities who may manifest "aging" behaviors prematurely? In response, the APSC offers training workshops and statewide conferences, has developed health screening tools and DVDs on healthy diets and nutrition for adults with lifelong disabilities, and more.</p>
<p>Increasingly, service providers and family caregivers are pressing us for more focus on matters related to dementia with intellectual disabilities and other developmental disabilities. Our fall 2011 workshop did and our June 2012 statewide conference will concentrate on dementia care with lifelong disabilities. Adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities present new challenges to providers and families. Premature expression of Alzheimer's Disease by adults with Down syndrome generally precludes their engagement in aging-related services funded by the Older American Act which stipulates age 60 for eligibility. Dementia disrupts group homes for individuals with lifelong disabilities, for it overwhelms staff's ability to respond in the face of other continuing needs by those without dementia and breaks the bond of community that the adults with disabilities have developed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the overwhelming majority of today's older adults with lifelong disabilities have grown old in family contexts, in the care of their parents, not in an institutional setting. These caregiving parents, now quite advanced in age, are often under-recognized and under-reinforced by outside services, and the presentation of dementia is often more than they can handle. There are today about one million adults with lifelong developmental disabilities who have reached age 60 and beyond. Again, the great majority have done so through the continuing care of the parent and families. These parents and families need and deserve help.</p>
<p>The Draft National Plan does make mention of intellectual disabilities but we respectfully request that the Draft National Plan make a fuller focus, to include at least the following:</p>
<ol><li>Attention to the special circumstances attendant upon the relatively premature expression of dementia among adults with Down syndrome, an expression that occurs before the individual's own eligiblity for aging-related services funded by the Older Americans Act.</li>
<li>Attention to the expression of dementia among adults with other developmental disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, non-Down intellecual disabilities) and the consequences of the co-morbidity of dementia and the lifelong disability.</li>
<li>Attention to the growing need of managers, service providers, and policy makers with the developmental disabilities service sector for high quality training on Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, training that includes both conceptual and practical day-to-day management content.</li>
<li>Attention to the public reliance upon family caregivers as the mainstay of the long-term care system, as it relates to aging with lifelong disabilities, and to the critical needs of thse family caregivers for training in and support about caring for someone with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities who develops Alzheimer's Disease or another dementia.</li>
</ol><p>We thank you for considering our recommendations. With best wishes, I remain</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>

<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>

<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, I am writing in support of the proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders (ADRD) that would promote an earlier diagnosis of the disease, improve strategies for long term services and supports, and accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging was created by the State Legislature in 1973 for the purpose of improving the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the single State agency authorized to receive and dispense Federal Older Americans Act funds and is mandated to provide a comprehensive coordinated service system for the State's 2.2 million older persons, giving high priority to those in greatest need. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network, caregivers and persons with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, an estimated 222,300 individuals in Illinois are living with Alzhiemer's disease with a direct and indirect financial toll of $5.2 billion. More than 70% of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease are living at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to assist care recipients with Activities of Dailiy Living (ADLs) than caregivers to other persons.<sup>(1)</sup> Caregivers often help to manage other serious medical conditions in addition to Alzheimer's, and because Alzheimer's and other dementia usually progress slowly, most caregivers spend many years in the caregiving role.<sup>(2)</sup> In 2006 the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Family Caregiver Association reported an estimated 1.2 million family caregivers in Illinois were providing 1.3 million hours of care to family members. As the baby boom generation enters the age of greatest risk for Alzheimer's, by 2025 their number in Illinois is expected to increase to over 239,000.</p>
<p>Thirteen Area Agencies on Aging and statewide service providers comprise the Aging Network in Illinois, which effectively links older persons with needed services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP), implemented through the Aging Nework, provides five basic service categories to family caregivers including: information about services; assistance in accessing services; counseling; support groups and trianing/education; respite care; and, supplemental services.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, 66,132 Illinoisans received assistance through services of the NFCSP. Additionally, 493,313 individuals received assistance through supportive and nutrition services of the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>The proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders contains thoughtful recommendations which address the immediate and long-term needs of caregivers, providers and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Aging Network in Illinois is committed to providing services to Alzheimer patients, their families and caregivers through a number of programs which support the five goals of the National Plan.</p>
<ul><li>Public Education and Outreach: Through Title III-B efforts under the Older Americans Act and Title III-E programs of the National Family Caregiver Support Program the Aging Network provided education and outreach on aging issues and available resources to 6,429 individuals in FY 2011. Additionally, the Department collaborates with many professional organizations to provide education and training opportunities. Examples include the Annual Elder Rights Conference; Senior Expos; Area Agencies on Aging sponsored Lunch and Learn/Brown Bag events; Caregiver Conferences; AIRS (Alliance of Information and Referral Systems) training; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Older Caregiver Training.</li>
<li>Outreach to healthcare providers: Home and community-based resources are critical to ensure that persons living with Alzheimer's disease are adequately and safely cared for in their homes as long as possible and contain the cost of health care. The Illinois Department on Aging sponsors many conferences and workshops for professionals including the Community Care Program/Case Coordination Unit Annual Supervisor Conference convening supervisors from case coordination units and home care agencies; the Annual Governor's Conference on Aging and Illinois TRAID comprised of state and local law enforcement agencies and other professional organizations. The Department also promotes the use of the Administration on Aging's National Alzheimer's Call Center by caregivers and encourages referrals by AAAs and providers.</li>
<li>Expanded support for people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers in the community: The Department has aggressively pursued funding to expand and enhance services for caregivers. In 2009 the Administration on Aging awarded the Department a three year Lifespan Respite grant which has enhanced access to and improved awareness of respite services. The Department has established a statewide Caregiver Advisory Committee which convenes regularly to discuss caregiver issues, share resources and best practices and review caregiver programs and is establishing protocol to implement and effective service delivery system through Aging and Disability Resource Centers/Coordinated Points of Entry.</li>
<li>Improved data collection and analysis: The Department works closely with the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging to collect data for NAPIS reporting as well as reviewing current caregiver assessment tools.</li>
</ul><p>In 2009, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Related Dementia State Plan - Senate Joint Resolution 43 - Report to the Governor and General Assembly." Recommendations in this report are reflected in the National Plan and include:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing adequate staffing levels and funding</li>
<li>Establishing basic and specialized education and training for persons when responsibilities make it likely they will come into contact with persons with AD and related dementias and their caregivers</li>
<li>Facilitate planning, treatment and research</li>
<li>Provide assistance to unpaid caregivers of persons with AD</li>
<li>Determine an effective system to collect data</li>
</ul><p>We must continue to examine our current capability to meet the Alzheimer's crisis and propose action to prepare for and respond to these challenges which include the development of a standardized caregiver assessment; establishment of the ADRC service delivery model; continue collaborative efforts of the Lifespan Respite Program; continue to incorporate consumer directed care service models through the National Family Caregiver Support Program; continue to collaborate with the Alzheimer's Association in Illinois; utilize Area Agencies on Aging and service providers to disseminate information and provide culturally sensitive training and materials to providers and caregivers; assist families and individuals in planning for future needs and provide updates to families, caregivers and providers regarding the latest clinical guidelines and information on how to work with people with AD; examine the capacity of public safety and law enforcement to respond to person's with Alzheimer's; examination of trends in the Alzheimer's population and needs, including assistance to persons with early stage and early on-set Alzheimer's and persons with Alzheimer's and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging and the Aging Network is committed to continue to respond in the most appropriate and effective way to this growing health problem and meet the challenge of providing service to Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers. The proposed National Plan is sensitive to local efforts to support caregivers and direct-care workers and offers viable proposals to support, educate and train the direct-care workforce and state aging workforces.

<p>Caregiver support: comment/recommendations for a caregiver "proxy" for specific recurring elements/items to obtain AZ care and/or documentation of services. For example, there is a service here in Maryland (maybe all states - but I never utilized it until I moved here). For a fee (that is well worth it) the service is automobile title/tax documentation and filing. This title service obtains the necessary information from the owner of the vehicle and then completes the necessary processes at the title/courthouse to research title, complete documents and file the title.</p>
<p>Something similar could/should be offered to caregivers. They lose many hours from their own work/family/life spending hours dealing with the mandatory documentation/filing/provider visits - Insurance, Medicare, SSI, finances.</p>
<p>Improvements could be gained through informatics and digitalization of records and bioscreen/markers. Obtain information from AZ healthcare proxy/financial proxy caregivers to write a book on a step wise process of what is required by caregivers to file Medicare, SSI, etc. and suggestions on how a business "proxy" service could do this work. And/or how to automate the procedures through functionalities through a software application and with secure/encryption.</p>
<p>Home/housing models: I hear repeatedly that it is cheaper for an AZ patient to live at home (if home is available) than in an institutional setting. That is not true in the current environment. The cost of maintaining 24h/7d care in an AZ patient home is more expensive that placing the AZ patient in an institution. For example, the cost of care in Alabama, is primarily due to in-house sitter/aide - minimum $12-15/hour, is the equivalent of $264-$360/day, equivalent to up to $10,000/month. This does not include cost of housing overhead, food, medications, transportation, clothing, toiletries, taxes. The cost of AZ/dementia care in an assisted living facility is about 50% of that cost (includes housing, utilities, and food). Either cost is excessive and any personal savings are rapidly consumed and then insurance (if coverage purchased), then Medicaid pays.</p>
<p>The only way to reduce or minimize in home care is for volunteer services and/or family live in care. Churches may be a "mission" service and should consider the care/education/services for elderly adultsequivalent to the resources they invest in children services. With improvement of technology, monitoring/tracking devices, virtual monitoring, the care in house may be drastically reduced until the AZ patient is incapable of or has severe reductions in ADLs.</p>

<p>I hope the attached serves as a useful mechanism for bringing nonpharmacological issues to the fore in the final draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>While the Draft National Alzheimer's Plan mentions nonpharmacological treatments and initiatives for dementia, it does so in a way that enables these important initiatives to be easily sidelined through lack of funding, lack of understanding and inappropriate research.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that the unique and positive alternative paradigm of nonpharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's must be recognized. This paradigm has several key dimensions that the National Alzheimer's Plan must recognize as a legitimate treatment modality for Alzheimer's and related dementias that can significantly improve the lives of those with these conditions and can significantly reduce costs in the care and treatment of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>The following must be recognized and included in the plan if these significant care options are to be valued as they clearly need to be so the many millions of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias today and tomorrow receive the quality of life and human rights they deserve.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><em>A DIFFERENT PARADIGM<br />
							Nonpharmacological interventions represent a global paradigm of Alzheimer's treatment; much more than just individual actions such as chocolate, dolls, and environmental design. This paradigm, based on neuroscience theory, applied research, and clinical practice, has been developed by many experts over decades. If this powerful approach to dealing with dementia and reducing symptoms is to be taken seriously, the particulars, no matter how exceptional (such as museum programs for people with Alzheimer's, providing improvisational theatre, or giving chocolate), need to be taken as examplars of a larger way of thinking about Alzheimer's and dementia--a new paradigm--not as ends in themselves. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE<br />
							There is a huge cache of evidence-based knowledge demonstrating how non-pharmacological interventions reduce symptoms and improve daily lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. This research is often discounted and rejected because although it is meaningful and fits the needs of the evaluation being conducted, it does not fit a particular research model--the double blind randomized controlled trial. It is important to assess these data carefully to calculate the statistical effect sizes they represent and thus their impact on people's lives. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>METHODOLOGY AND METHODS<br />
							Much existing research is discounted by policymakers, researchers, and others because they are convinced that the only evidence worth counting is generated by double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs represent one important way to generate knowledge; but only one way. Other methodologies contribute substantially to our knowledge of nonpharmacological interventions and need to be taken seriously. It makes little sense to discredit a large body of knowledge that could immensely help policy and decision-making. The following summarizes two alternative ways to think about research methodology. </em></p>
<p><em>The RCT gold standard assumes that 1. It is the highest level of proof, no matter what the research question, 2. It is at the top of a hierarchy of methods where other methodologies are "lower" on the continuum, and 3. That statistical significance is a measure of meaningfulness of a finding. </em></p>
<p><em>The alternative gold standard for nonpharmacological and other research assumes that 1. The best methodology for any research question is the methodology that fits the question best--not any particular one, 2. There is no single continuum of methodology and no absolute hierarchy, and. 3. That effect measures are an important addition to statistical significance as a measure of a finding's "meaningfulness." </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
							Freedom to choose, getting what you want, being part of the larger society and taking part in cultural activities are human rights everyone deserves--including those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. We ought to be shocked at the limits to human rights being imposed daily on those with dementia (no chocolate and no visits to museums) rather than amazed that human rights are being respected in a few places--Arizona, or New York, or Massachusetts or wherever. </em></p>
<p><em>The World Health Organization defines the rights of all people as dignity, independence, self-fulfillment, participation and care. Respecting these for people living with Alzheimer's could well be a rallying cry for those who care about people living with this condition.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>THE WAY OUT OF THE ETHICAL DILEMMA OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS<br />
							In the name of science and further research, there is a movement taking place to diagnose Alzheimer's disease long before those being diagnosed show any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although these tests are presented as limited to research purposes, they are highly likely to be employed in everyday practice. For the millions who will receive this early diagnosis tomorrow and the millions living with this dementia diagnosis today, early diagnosis presents a major ethical dilemma: What to do with a diagnosis if no medications are available that stop the progress of the disease? The nonpharmacological paradigm and its associated interventions represent an ethical way to respond to the call for early Alzheimer's diagnosis since they offer a clear solution to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. </em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>For these reasons, we urge that an expert and champion of nonpharmacological approaches and treatments for dementia be appointed to generate research, direct information gathering and otherwise serve the needs of those with dementia today employing nonpharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and others administering research programs for dementia to include on an equal basis in all research, both nonpharmacological treatments and pharmacological ones. By nonpharmacological "treatments" we mean all health related activities that research has demonstrated have positive behavioral and health outcomes. These include, among others: engaging activity, exercise, targeted nutrition, music, visual arts, film, drama, museums, an appropriately designed and stimulating environment, memory books, high-touch end of life care, external written cueing, information technology, training family and formal caregivers, counseling, meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, poetry, storytelling, pets, and even chocolate.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and those administering Alzheimer's-focused research programs and Alzheimer's-focused intervention strategies to develop and make explicit key performance indicators suited to nonpharmacological interventions. We also urge them to include in research protocols all evaluation methods and methodologies suited to studying the effects of real-world applications of nonpharmacological treatments. We urge that all research involving treatment of dementia, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, include reporting the clinical significance of effects produced by treatments, as well as statistical significance.</p>

<p><em>This letter is very similar to my oral testimony (a few corrected typos and better words)--except for my adding a new paragraph at the beginning--to respond more fully to a public comment that preceded mine:</em></p>
<p>A person (Michael Ellenbogen?) who currently suffers from mild Alzheimer's dementia concluded his comments by recommending the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services consider the "right-to-die" option. He thus implied that Physician-Assisted Dying could be an option for patients who suffer from dementia. Because of time limitations, I could only disagree briefly by saying that Physician-Assisted Dying will neither help nor is needed. I now explain more: (1) Why would Physician-Assisted Dying NOT help? Where Physician-Assisted Dying is legal, the law requires patients be of "sound mind" when they ask their physician to write a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Yet dementia patients lose the mental capacity to make medical decisions early in the course of this progressive disease. Thus for dementia patients, Physician-Assisted Dying would compound their tragedy with <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong>. This is because dementia patients can have much good life after they lose capacity--and they can expect more, with further research--so I and many others consider <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong> an act that violates the <strong><em>principle that life is precious</em></strong>. (2) Why is Physician-Assisted Dying NOT needed? Because Living Will forms and the discussions they provoke can be both moral and effective. Combined with other clinical and strategic forms, diligent Advance Care Planning can give people peace of mind, whether they are still well or in the early stage of dementia. They need not worry about being forced to linger for months to years by enduring the huge burdens and suffering that characterize Advanced Dementia. Instead, they can feel confident that others <strong><em>will honor their Known Wishes</em></strong> after they lose the ability to speak for themselves.</p>
<p><em>Here is my original comment:</em></p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is most urgent, <strong>most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend that their patients/clients complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most urgent</strong>? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The reality of the huge, increasing epidemic of patients whose lives will end as they suffer from Alzheimer's disease makes Advance Care Planning even more urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most important</strong>? Because patients can linger in the terminal stage of Alzheimer's Dementia for several years. The relentless course of their disease may frustrate the best efforts of their clinicians, their caregivers and their loved ones. The multiple burdens on others are well known. For example, more than one-third of Alzheimer's caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many who have lost the ability to complain and whose behavior may be atypical, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most challenging</strong>? Unlike other terminal illnesses, often there are no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." They may believe: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. Then, I'll be trapped in a condition I loathe so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only compound the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients effective advance care planning so they can feel confident they can choose to avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then, many will ironically choose to live as long and as well as possible--and benefit from improvements in the medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning for Advanced Dementia needs research funding to develop and to implement--even if other researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. We know that changes in the brains of dementia patients begin one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. We also know it takes many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and to adopt a policy to implement widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers predicted to get dementia are still likely to become demented. Even if a new drug were available today, patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia. Most importantly, when they do reach the advanced stage of dementia, these patients will then have only their Advance Directives on which they can rely, to control <em>how long, and how much, they must suffer</em>before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we must thus fund research programs that will: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend their clients and patients have the discussions and complete the forms...now, while they still can.</p>

<p>I would like to thank this committee for their efforts on this project. I am writing a very long letter and hope someone takes the time to read it and forward to all involved.</p>
<p>As this plan moves forward I can applaud the parts of the plan that involve research and drug development. I am sure it will make the researchers and drug companies very happy!! I have no problem researching earlyon set Alzhemers, but really the brain is an organ just like the heart and lungs. There is no cure for old, period! When a person shows signs of this disease at 75 years of age it is just that, the brain is getting old. The government can dump millions into drugs that they them selves will be paying for. Do you know how much Nemenda costs? Most people that take it could never afford it, so the government pays for a drug that has very little effect on the person that takes it. Financial aid and support to the families trying to care for a loved one at home is where this country will benefit.</p>
<p>I am a 52 year old daughter taking care of an 87 year old father with severe Alzheimers. We have a unique situation where I as well as 2 brothers live next door to my dad on land given to us by him. For the last 10 years I have taken care of him as well as worked and raised a family. I have 2 children who are in the health field, 1 a nurse and 1 in a Doctor Pharmacy program, that I struggle to keep in school since I have had to stop working. In the beginning my dad just required monitoring, meals delivered and laundry done, as the disease progressed we alarmed the house so he could not wander off at night. He tripped and broke his right hip in April 2010, surgery made the disease go crazy and I have been a full time caregiver since that day! My data never took a dime of government assistance, he lived and worked as a construction worker and farmed through some very difficult times. He had maybe $35,000 in an IRA when this began. My brothers help where they can and I private pay caregivers (35 hours per week) with the money he has remaining to the tune of $1400 a month. He collects $1267 social security. So after utilities, insurance, drugs and food the remainder comes from the IRA. You can see that when we pre-pay a funeral he will almost be broke. I stopped working, stay 5 nights a week with my dad. Moving someone to a skilled care only worsens this disease or any dementia. April 2011 dad broke his left hip, Hospital 5 days Nov 2011 for and infection. After every surgery or hospital stay he was sent to skilled care (I use that term very loosely) the very basics are not being met in these homes, my dad was left unattended wet and soiled on a daily basis. He developed pineal yeast infections that went unchecked until I discovered it. This is caused by neglect and poor hygiene The workers are miserable, patients are ignored, no one smiles or even pretends to hear them. Don't believe me, take off your suit and go undercover for a visit. I saw this care across the board in 3 different skilled care facilities. My dad is no longer verbal enough to get a point across, but after every trip to a skilled home I would insist on bringing him home when he looked like death. Home is where it is at!!! Love and proper care, I have him walking with a walker, I have him on a bathroom schedule (he is never wet). At night I taught myself how to use an external catheter (something I had to fight to have Medicare approve). This is an aid that is simple to use and eliminates wetness at night and helps to prevent bedsores.</p>
<p>My dad now receives some help from the area on aging, that provides 3 half days of daycare. This is income based and I am controlled if I want to remain in the program to keep his withdraws from his IRA to a minimum. I do this so he dosen't run out of money therefore forcing him onto Medicaid and forcing us to put him in a home. Where is the burden of care? on me!!! Now we are hearing budgets cut to the access public transportation he rides to and from day care. I will be forced to enroll my dad onto Medicaid this will cost the government more than $9,000 monthly.</p>
<p>We were not rich enough to hire an Elder Attorney to transfer my dads assets out of his name, nor do we feel it was our right. How many rich people are on Medicaid because they were taught to spend down their assets? Not one person in this country should be able to give their undeserving children an inheritance before they die, period! Not one person is more in need of skilled care than my dad 24/7 and I could qualify him in a heart beat if I pre-pay a funeral. However I know without a doubt that I am giving him better care than he would get in a home. He is happy in his home and everyday that he smiles and says thank you is a gift to me!</p>
<p>My recommendations give the families financial help to keep their loved ones at home. Give the care giver that quit her job a tax break, so they can continue to help send their own children to college. Allow people to hire quality private care givers, don't force an agency that charges double the hourly rate on us. Respite care that is now covered only under Medicaid, so that we can a least get a weeksbreak to refresh our minds would be nice! Stop taxing the elderly when they can prove every dime of there money is going to care for themselves. Adult Day care should be a medical expense.</p>
<p>I also see both sides of this story my in-laws were forced by 2 of their children to move to assisted living. They pay $4300 a month and my father-in-law takes care of his wife their and the home is very happy to have them. They should be, he does their job for them and they collect the pay check!!! They hate where they live!</p>
<p>There was a song written over 50 years ago the title is "The House of Shame" by Smiley Bates. My dad would call a local radio station almost every Saturday and request it, he then would call each of his children to tell them listen to it. I challenge you to listen to it, I did! Nothing has really changed in 50 years.</p>
<p>I am sorry this is so long, but unless you know the entire problem you can not fix it.</p>

<p>As a 66-year old woman who is conservator for a relative with Alzheimer's and who has watched several other relatives lose their mental faculties and eventually all their other faculties before they died a very long drawn out death, I cannot urge you enough to increase the amount of money spent on research into Alzheimer's and other dementia diseases. Yes, Alzheimer's is devastating to the individual and possibly even more so to the families and caregivers.</p>
<p>When I see that HIV/AIDS research receives about $3 billion from our government whereas Alzheimer's, with 5 times as many affected Americans as there are American HIV patients, even with this new initiative will only get half a billion dollars, I truly don't understand why research into Alzheimer's is so underfunded. I also don't understand why HIV/AIDS patients receive much more government paid assistance than patients with most other diseases. I'm afraid the Alzheimer's lobby has not been vocal enough unlike the HIV/AIDS lobby. But I admire what has been accomplished in making HIV now a treatable chronic illness because of the resources invested in that research.</p>
<p>Don't waste a lot of funding looking for more expensive ways to diagnose Alzheimer's when simple questionnaires and interviews can determine that dementia is present or not. Since dementia is not contagious early diagnosis is only helpful for getting your affairs in order until a viable treatment is discovered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the drugs currently used for Alzheimer's have any long-term benefit and even short-term benefits are questionable. Basic research into what causes or leads to Alzheimer's is where most of the funding needs to go. Hopefully this could lead to understanding how to avoid Alzheimer's altogether as prevention is always preferable and less expensive than treatment. It is is important to include nutritional supplements such as curcumin and vinpocetine in the research since studies have demonstrated some success with several supplements. Just because they can't be patented by drug companies, not enough money is being spent on their research. How cost effective they would be for both patients and the health care system.</p>
<p>If prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is not found soon the cost to the government will be astronomical in the future, as families have less ability and inclination to care for dementia patients at home. I predict dementia patients will frequently be abandoned so they can receive medicaid-paid nursing home care.</p>
<p>I urge the Alzheimer's plan to be implemented quickly and research funding be increased exponentially.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) is a non-profit collaborative of eleven national organizations that represent a unique blend of key stakeholders in assisted living. CEAL promotes high-quality assisted living, serves as a convener to bring together diverse stakeholders to discuss and examine issues related to assisted living, helps bridge research, practice and policies that foster quality and affordability, and maintains an objective national clearinghouse of information and resources about assisted living.</p>
<p>The CEAL commends the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy for developing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to address the growing need for treatment and services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their loved ones.</p>
<p>Assisted living plays an increasingly important role in providing services for persons living with Alzheimer's disease in a safe, structured community based setting. Over 31,000 assisted living communities across the United States provide care and services to nearly 750,000 residents; with more than 40 percent of those individuals living with some form of dementia.</p>
<p>Services offered in assisted living that can benefit individuals living with cognitive impairment include health monitoring, medication management, assistance with activities of daily living, social activity programs, nutrition services, and others. Offering these services in a structured and secure environment creates a unique solution to meet the immediate care and supervision needs of persons living with Alzheimer's disease now and in the future. Indeed many states have special disclosure and staff training requirements for assisted living communities that provide dementia care.</p>
<p><strong>CEAL Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Because assisted living is clearly a setting of choice for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, we recommend the following technical edits to Goals 2 and 3 outlined in the National Plan:</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency<br />
						"High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis through the end-of-life and in settings including people's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
<li>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support<br />
						"People with Alzheimer's disease and their families need supports that go beyond the care provided in formal settings such as doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and/or assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
</ul><p>On behalf of the CEAL board of directors I thank you for this opportunity to comment on the draft framework, and I offer our support for the ongoing work of the advisory council and the Department in implementing the important goals outlined in the National Plan.</p>

<p>As a nurse of over 20 years I was shocked to learn that the draft of recommendations on how to overcome the Alzheimer's crisis didn't include Assisted Living. As our population ages, and is living longer due to advances in detection and treatment Alzheimer's disease will only become more of a problem. Assisted Living is one of the best options for those suffering from this disease. Nursing homes are for those with skilled needs. Medicare will not pay for someone to be in a nursing home because they have Dementia and need help with ADLs they can no longer do for themselves. If a person doesn't have $10.000.000-15,000.00/month to pay privately for a nursing home, which they really shouldn't be in, what option do they have. Children today are no longer able to care for their parents as they were many years ago. Most households have both people working, busy lifestyles, and it's just not an option. Assisted living enables people with dementia to still live independently in a safe environment where help is available when needed, or for those with severe dementia an environment where all of their ADLs, medication management, social, and nutritional needs are provided for. The cost is half the price of a nursing home in a social environment. How this could have been left out makes me wonder who the drafters of the recommendations were, and what their backgrounds are. Not only as a nurse but also as the daughter of a mother who suffered from Dementia, please include Assisted Living. Our older generation deserves the best quality of care in an environment that is enjoyable. We all will be old someday and may have Dementia, we would want this for ourselves so let's give it to our parents.</p>

<p>It is with great concern that in review of the draft of the National Alzheimer's Project Act that the entire sector of assisted living benefits was omitted from your review and recommendations. In every state in our country, assisted living venues house and care for men and women who have been affected by Alzheimer's. It is the foundation of senior living to assist with the components of memory care that not only deal with the necessities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, grooming and nutrition, but also to foster the necessary continual mind engaging programming and social camaraderie needs that every person with memory impairment deserves. If your research was thorough, I am sure you found that assisted living is a lower cost and more successful alternative to skilled nursing environments across the country. In a more homelike environment, people thrive as their bodies typically remain well through their disease progression while working to coax their brain connections each day to try to maintain as much cognition as possible.</p>
<p>Please re-evaluate your dismissal of assisted living as part of your recommendations in the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>

<p>Respite Care Funds for Care Givers:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>Respite Care funds must be made available for those people who lack private resources, funds, transportation and family support. Many caregivers provide 24 hour care in their home with no break, financial assistance or outside help. This leaves the care giver exhausted. Many of our nations care givers are elderly themselves. Caring for someone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia is a full time job. Care givers provide full time supervision, medication disbursements, ADL care (bathing, toileting and dressing), housekeeping services, meal preparation, transportation to and from appointments, etc. Many are unable to work due to the time required to care for a loved one. This depletes their funds.</p>
<p>The respite funds should be used to either place a loved one in adult day care program, hire a private duty aide/home health aide, have a senior companion volunteer come to the home, utilize nursing home and assisted living respite services or whatever community program that works for the Care Giver.</p>
<p>Currently, care givers are exhausted with no relief in sight. Many are depressed and lonely. They are cut off from their friends, church members and neighbors. They are unable to enjoy a quality of life many of us who are not full time care givers take for granted. They are unable to go to church, participate in a hobby or any other social event. Just going grocery shopping is challenging.</p>
<p>Isolation can also lead to abuse and neglect. Most care givers have the best intentions but abuse and neglect can happens when there is stress, isolation, lack of funding and lack of support.</p>
<p>Where there are respite services in a state the Care giver lacks funding and transportation. I saw first hand as a facilitator of a support group the desperate needs of the care givers. Some respite services are time consuming with lengthy paper work required. There may be waiting lists making respite services unattainable when they need it the most. Many community respite services require the care giver to transport their loved one and they are unable to provide this. Or there may be no respite community services with in their community.</p>
<p>There must be state and federal funds available for caregivers without funding to use for respite services. Each community should be looking at ways to keep the patient in the home and provide the care giver options such as home care respite services, assisted living and nursing home respite services and volunteer senior companion programs all of which provides options for the care giver.</p>

<p>I am a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner working with the Geriatric Population. I care for and diagnose Dementia on a very regular basis. After reviewing the document for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease I recommend the following amendments:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A </strong></p>
<p>Add Neuropsychologist to the list, they are invaluable in the accurate diagnosis of many of the other Dementia's and early identification of mild cognitive disorders, which will likely progress to Alzheimer's. There are not enough of these very specialized professionals to address the wave of dementia that will be occurring with this rapidly growing aging population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D </strong></p>
<p>There is a large portion of the population with Dementia, that would be best served by an Assisted Living Setting (not safe at home alone, no family support available, no skilled nursing needs). This large group often live in unsafe conditions because there is no funding source (other than private pay) for this intermediate level of care. Those that need help with meals, transportation, ADL's r/t safety (in and out tub), perhaps medication monitoring/reminders/set-up, daily checks, built in emergency call system in case of falls. This would not have to be manned by RN's like SNF in LTcare. But perhaps monitored by an LPN or Designated Geriatric Provider of some kind with training in the care of mild to moderate Dementia. Families often struggle with putting a loved one in a "nursing home", so those with Dementia are either provided too high or too low a level of care. This would very likely decrease the cost of expenditures for long-term care, as it would substantially delay the use of LTC.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.B </strong></p>
<p>Provisions for in-home respite care for those who choose to have loved ones live with them, is an invaluable service, which would allow for less caregiver burn-out and delay admission to a 24hr facility. Thus cutting down the expenditure of resources, before they are necessary</p>
<p>This Very complex issue will not be solved quickly or easily, I hope the above suggestions from a practitioners point of view are helpful in improving the quality of care and quality of life for those suffering with Dementia.</p>

<p>I heard about this Federal, national initiative with great interest. Like cancer care, there needs to be an emphasis on research; however, there also needs to be an emphasis on finding high-quality, low cost, exceptional long-term care with dignity for persons with Alzheimer's and their families.</p>
<p>I am attaching a proposal I have for such (nationwide) care. I would like it to be considered by the committee as part of the national plan. I think it addresses care-giver support, the health care and other financial expenses, and the need for persons with Alzheimer's to live the rest of their lives with dignity.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROPOSAL FOR A NEW STATE (NATION)-WIDE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM ALZHEIMER'S CARE DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The problem</strong></em>: We know that Alzheimer's Disease is putting an ever increasing burden on persons with the disease, their care-givers, the health care system, and society at large. It presents an urgent problem for our Nation, our State and our local communities.</p>
<p><strong>One key issue is finding affordable care for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. This presents significant challenges for spouses, children and friends of those with Alzheimer's. Adult children often have to leave the workplace to provide care for aging parents, resulting in economic hardships and increased emotional stress as well as physical illnesses for themselves and their family members. Spouses may also end up with financial struggles as well as social isolation and additional psychological and physical ailments at the end of their lives, taking care of their spouse with dementia. The toll on children, spouses, friends, businesses, the healthcare system, and governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, mark this challenge as a future crisis for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, there is a lack of affordable care options for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. The cost of care ranges from $4,000-$5,000/month for assisted living/memory unit care to $5,000-$7,000/month for nursing home care. Daycare is around $10/hour. Long term health insurance often pays for a limited number of years of care, requiring families to assume costs after this period ends. For many persons with Alzheimer's, Medicaid may eventually pay for their care.</p>
<p><strong>Most would agree that whenever possible, care should be given at home</strong>. The benefits of optimal home care are many, and include:</p>
<ol><li>the familiarity and security of a home-like setting</li>
<li>24/7 supervised care from familiar individuals</li>
<li>constant interaction/stimulation/socialization</li>
<li>adequate diet and nutrition</li>
<li>the possibility of regular outings outside the home, such as trips to the gym, salon or dinners out with familiar companions</li>
</ol><p><strong>In a word, such care ideally enables the person with Alzheimer's to age with dignity, respect, optimal health, and have excellent, continuous care for the rest of their lives. </strong></p>
<p>But what does this require? It often means the care-giver leads two lives, theirs and that of the person with Alzheimer's. Those who have done it know this is unsustainable and will take a significant and dramatic emotional, physical, and financial toll on them and their families.</p>
<p><strong><em>The solution</em>: What is needed for persons with Alzheimer's is <em>optimal, AFFORDABLE care in a home-like setting without requiring 24/7 care from their family members or friends</em></strong>. Imagine a world in which NO ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE! You and your family members/friends could rest assured that you would have an optimal, affordable long-term care option if you had or were to develop Alzheimer's. Although this sounds like a dream, <strong>it can become reality if several parties who are impacted by this problem (basically, all of us!) work together. THIS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT CARE DELIVERY PARADIGM, one that is NON-FOR PROFIT, IN WHICH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</strong>.</p>
<p>What would this look like? How could this be achieved? The following is a suggested model.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong><em>First, there would be a registry of individuals needing such care</em></strong>. This could be developed by the State for each county. Registries would include personal and financial information for each applicant. In addition, APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO BE LOCATED IN THE SAME AREA (COUNTY) AS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE ASSISTING IN THEIR CARE. So, for each county in Florida, a registry (waiting list) would be established showing individuals with Alzheimer's needing care as well as locations of nearby family members/friends who would need to commit to helping in their care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local homes for sale/in foreclosure would be purchased to create home settings in which the applicants would live</em></strong>. This would be the responsibility of the State, working with local governments, possibly with Federal/agency grant support. Initial costs for setting up the home might also be covered by Federal grants, possibly coupled with local government tax breaks as well as local business and charity support. Each home would have 3-4+ residents living there (depending on the size of the home) The residents for each home would be selected on the basis of their monthly incomes, with each home including a mix of upper, middle and lower income residents to insure a sufficient income stream to take care of home costs (mortgage, utilities, food). Each person in the home would be required to pay only their monthly income (be it Social Security or other pension or income source), allowing for spousal support, if that were an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staffing for each home would include a small number of full-time professional staff (again, supported by State funding/Federal grant support) as well as MANDATORY VOLUNTEERS comprised of family members/friends</em></strong>. A REQUIREMENT OF RESIDENCY IN THE HOME IS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS <em>MUST</em> WORK A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS/WEEK IN THE HOME. The less income a person living in the home has to provide to the home for his /her care, the more hours would be required of their family/friends as "sweat equity" to support the home. Volunteers would undergo criminal background checks and mandatory drug testing at their own expense. They would also undergo possible inservice/orientation training. THEIR ATTENDANCE FOR WORK SHIFTS AT THE HOME WOULD BE MANDATORY. Not showing up for their scheduled weekly times could result in their family member/friend being expelled from the home. (Family members could substitute time shifts for each other, provided they were in-serviced/screened to work at the home.) These volunteers would take care of all home needs such as meal preparation, home maintenance (cleaning, lawn work, home repair, etc.), driving residents to appointments, socializing with residents, etc. They would also complete select activities with their own family members, such as bathing and when working their shift, dressing their family member, as possible. Their general supervision and schedules would be established by the permanent staff. Given the presence of the volunteers, at any given time, there would be a minimum of a one-to-one or greater staff-to-resident ratio. That is, there would always be optimal supervision, socialization, and attention given to each resident and their individual needs. Also, given that family members would always be working at the home, <em>everyone would have a vested interest in the success of the home</em>. This arrangement would also insure that family members/friends would have exposure to Alzheimers/senior needs and care and the aging process, resulting in a more educated, informed population with respect to these issues. Finally, family members and staff would have an available, in-house network of support, to assist with any issues or emotions they might be experiencing as family members/caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Salaries of the permanent staff, although possibly a government expense, would be small in comparison to the increased burden to the State and Federal governments of escalating healthcare costs. For example, how much would Medicare and Medicaid save in not having persons with Alzheimer's over-medicated, incorrectly medicated and/or in and out of emergency rooms/hospitals/doctor's offices for preventable problems, not to mention the costs of taking care of the health issues of their family/friend care-givers? How much would Medicaid save in not having to provide indigent care to these individuals once they've exhausted all their resources?? These cost savings could be enormous.</p>
<p>A further benefit to the healthcare system might be in the training of professionals dealing with Alzheimer's care and care of the elderly given that resident physicians and other professionals in geriatric medicine might staff the homes or be on-call for the homes, increasing their direct exposure to aging individuals and those with Alzheimer's. Such an arrangement might significantly decrease the need for emergency room visits, doctor's visits, and hospital stays for persons with Alzheimer's. This would also increase professional education/experience and, as a result, might dramatically decrease healthcare costs for this population. An alternate model might include established physicians volunteering some of their time to examining residents of the homes or consulting with the permanent staff in the homes re: health issues of the residents, again eliminating unnecessary use of the medical system.</p>
<p>Residents would stay in the home, with hospice care as needed, until the end of their lives. Transfers to nursing homes might be needed in some cases. When a resident left the home permanently, another resident on the registry (waiting list) would take that individual's place, preferably matched on the basis of financial criteria to insure the continued viability of the home.</p>
<p>If less homes are needed at some time in the future (possibly due to effective Alzheimer's treatments or a cure), homes could either be sold with the purchasing agent (State or Federal government) recouping the costs + profit OR the registry model and homes could be used for those with different, chronic health issues, such as housing for adults with Autism. THIS MODEL OF CARE WOULD <em>NOT</em> AFFECT CURRENT DELIVERY MODELS in that there will always be a need for existing assisted living facilities for persons who do not want to relocate close to family members/friends, have sufficient funds to be cared for as part of different care models or in their own homes, who prefer current facilities, and/or have significant medical needs to require nursing home care. WHAT IMPLIMENTATION OF THIS MODEL PREVENTS IS THE PROFLIFERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND THE ESCALATING COSTS TO CONSUMERS, WHO, ALONG WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, WILL BE CRUSHED BY THEM.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>In conclusion, we all know that something MUST be done to care for persons with Alzheimer's. The current model of care delivery, whether done at home or in a facility, is UNSUSTAINABLE for the majority of citizens</strong>. It is crushing to care-givers, the government, the business community, and society at large. The care given to the person with Alzheimer's is often inadequate. The current model will destroy our healthcare system and economy if something isn't done soon to change it. And the human toll is most significant, for persons with Alzheimer's as well as their family members, friends, and community at large.</p>
<p><strong>What is needed is a dramatically different model of care deliver AT THE STATE LEVEL with Federal support. It must be not for profit to contain costs. It must be a model in which all levels of government (local, state, federal) work with patients, families and local businesses to provide compassionate, dignified, and quality care to persons with Alzheimer's until the end of their lives</strong>. Our country is well positioned to show the world how this can be done, and Florida, with its large elderly population, should be at the forefront of this effort. If we can put a man on the moon 40 years ago, we can solve this health care crisis and show the rest of the country and world how it can be done!</p>

<p>The following are comments left by my readers regarding the draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Thank you for developing this plan and soliciting feedback!</p>
<p>(1) Jim says:</p>
<p>Back in 1961 president John F. Kennedy made a commitment of going to the moon. Then in 1969 NASA accomplish that goal, so if you do the math it only took about 8 years. Why does the government feel it would take only13 years to find a cure for Alzheimers? The drug industry have tried for years.in finding a cure. Meanwhile, the skilled nursing homes are being filled with dementia/Alzheimers victims in different stages that either end up dying of malnutrition or pneumonia. The disease is rapidly growing out of control as we are living longer.I fear the time to address this problem has already passed.</p>

					(2) C. Danesi says:</p>
<p>Its up to us as the americans who are caregivers for those afflicted to get involved with the council and help drive their progress so that it wont take 13 more years.i arranged care for my mom who has severe alzheimers and traveled to Washington to be involved with the councils first meeting.im on a limited budget.We can make this happen-We must!thankyou carla danesi glorias daughter "remember gloria,gloria lives"</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 5:10 pm<br />
					(3) T. Litz says:</p>
<p>In an effort to help people with Alzheimer's and their families the government should help financially by adding to medicare a provision to help pay for care givers, The cost of care is outragious. In the beginning some care and then 24/7. Nursing home options are just as expensive and take the quality of life away from individuals with dementia. When there is no money left and medicaid is the only option left the government intervenes. Then the Alzheimer's person has to have all their caregiver's changed to an approved medicaid agency. This change alone is frightening for the family and changes the relationships built up over years with private caregivers. My mother has had Alzheimer's for 9 years so far. Benefits from the VA have not been forthcoming for almost a year and seem almost unreachable. More documentation, more waiting and never an answer as to when her aide and attendance benefits will start or if she will ever even receive it. My father was a VET from World War II. I call the VA every 2 weeks and get no where. More documentation -the application was filed last Febuary and now almost a year later they are asking for more information/ medical information faxed 3 weeks ago and now they want financial documentation. It seems that they are waiting for my mom to die. Advocate all the time and get no where.</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 6:45 pm<br />
					(4) K. Lockhart says:</p>
<p>Besides the research that needs more money for this disease, medicare and other insurance companies need to support care in the home 24/7. My 83 year old mother can not do it for my dad who is 84. We have needed in home care for that past 2.5 years. We have been fortunate to afford the care so far but it isn't going to last. I do NOT want to put my father in a nursing home that still does not know how to care for Alzheimer or any other dementia patient.</p>
<p>Changes in the healthcae system to prepare and regulate whether or not they are in fact providing best practices for these patients is important. Without government interventions, families struggle inordinately financially, emotionally, and physically. The caregiving will kill my mom before anything else. Unless I quit my job to help, I can only do the weekends. Isn't it cheaper to keep him at home than place him?? Looks that way to me. Thanks, Kathy</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 11:16 pm<br />
					(5) M. Brennan says:</p>
<p>To prevent Alzheimer's disease, let's consider how people in countries with little Alzheimer's disease live (differences in diet? stress? sleep? environment? other differeces from us?)</p>
<p>Let's assure funding for any reasonable research proposal that could help prevent or delay Alzheimer's. The federal deficit is no excuse for skimping on this urgent need. The deficit will be far greater if we don't prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 12:38 am<br />
					(6) M. Monfredo says:</p>
<p>I will echo what others have said in regard to the need to fund home caregiving through a medicare provision. The cost of hiring someone from outside for even one day a week is prohibitively expensive for many families. It's far less expensive to society overall for Alzheimer's patients to remain in their homes and this fact should be reflected in financial relief to their primary caregivers. Until a cure is found, this financial need will become even more acute in our aging population.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 6:29 am<br />
					(7) T. Mumby says:</p>
<p>I know it fantastically difficult for all of us to STOP, turn around, see the person with dementia as OUR teacher and learn what changes we have to make in ourselves to promote well-being in our lives.</p>
<p>Seeing our loved one as a SICK PATIENT compounds the agony.</p>
<p>How many more trillions of dollars will poured into the monster money eating pharmaceutical industry? (Are you watching our financial decline?)</p>
<p>The variety of behavioural challenges is the MAJOR problem.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses and the medical model is for SICK people, not people who are challenging us and our own mental strength 24/7.</p>
<p>It is not really surprising to explain the difficult behaviour around people where dementia is being experienced.</p>
<p>Acute fear, panic, confusion, irrational actions are telling us to LEARN the art of conducting situations in a light creative style. When the lessons are mastered, the progression of dementia is about how well YOU are developing into a wise and kindly person through using your new skills.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's has a very simple and avoidable cause: steam-refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils. I have been working this out since 1990.</p>
<p>The unsuspected vitamin E deficiency in these widely consumed food oils leads to brain cell membrane oxidation, that impairs the function of important enzymes that normally degrade the beta-amyloid protein. This protein therefore accumulates, incredibly slowly, in the brain of a regular consumer of deodorized vegetable seed oils.</p>
<p>After the age of 65 or so, accumulated beta-amyloidmay release highly toxic soluble aggregates (called oligomers), that are the immediate cause of synaptic toxicity and neuronal death.</p>
<p>That is exactly how over 5 million Americans have ended up with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>My suggestion to your Government, is simply to legislate a requirement for all refined seed oils in your country to have any vitamin E deficit (usually 30%) corrected before distribution and sale. This simple step will also prevent ADHD occurring during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Already, this basic preventive step is under consideration by the Australian Government's Food Standards Authority, and we may be the first nation in the world to eliminate the twin brain epidemics of Alzheimer's and its prenatal partner, ADHD.</p>
<p>The USA--where vacuum steam-refining of seed oils was invented, in 1899 (David Wesson, Savannah)--has no shortage of brain power. What you lack is a safe level of vitamin E in your brain-oxidizing vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Can you fix the problem, and catch up with Australia?</p>
<p>When your Norfolk, Virginia shipyards were mass-producing Liberty ships for WW2 Atlantic convoys, a large banner was hung across the docks, saying:</p>
<p>IT CAN AND WILL BE DONE!!</p>
<p>Can you make vegetable oils safe? Can you do this too?</p>
<p>I attach a draft hypothesis for your inspection: I shall be trimming it down shortly, for submission to The Lancet, in London.</p>
<p>Here, at long last, is the direct cause of the disease: knowing this, we can easily prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease And Attention Deficit Disorder May Share A Single Cause: Refined Vegetable Oil</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>By Dr Robert Peers, General Practitioner, North Carlton, MELBOURNE</strong></p>
<p>In 1990 I identified a potential cause of typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), reporting my findings (a small case/control study) in a letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal [Ref 1] in 1993 (letter: "Alzheimer's Disease And Vegetable Oils"). I found that 12 cases of diagnosed AD had all consumed refined polyunsaturated seed oils for many years, contrasting with 20 age-matched control subjects with good memories, none of whom used such oils.</p>
<p>The reason for seeking a dietary cause was simple and compelling: AD had been seen to sometimes affect only one of a pair of identical twins [Ref 2], a striking finding that points strongly to some toxic or dietary cause. In addition, it was very unlikely to be caused by ageing itself, since the other twin was the same age, but remained unaffected in the long term; and because most older people do not in fact get the disease. I reasoned that those who were affected were somehow getting it from their diet, but how?</p>
<p>My initial reading even disclosed a likely dietary suspect: Professor Scott Henderson, an Australian research psychiatrist, cites in his 1988 AD review/hypothesis paper [Ref 3] a remarkable study [Ref 4] done by Professor Denham Harman in 1976, in Nebraska. Harman had a free radical theory of ageing, and knowing that both seed oils and the brain are rich in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids, he wondered whether feeding safflower oil to his rats might cause free radical damage to the brain: it certainly did, as his rats soon lost their way in a maze. Furthermore, giving vitamin E to a new group of rats, fed the same oil, prevented these cognitive deficits--a finding that suggests that his oil, and perhaps other seed oils too, were low in vitamin E.</p>
<p>This work made me very curious about common vegetable seed oils, which were well known to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk, but nobody had previously suspected them of actually causing a disease, and here they were evidently oxidizing the brain!</p>
<p>Soon after setting out on my library search for a dietary factor in 1990, I discovered that deodorized seed oils lose about a third of their antioxidant vitamin E during refining [Ref 5]--a potentially serious deficiency not seen in the soft margarines made from the same oils, which suffer polyunsaturate losses during hydrogenation, restoring the vitamin E/polyunsaturate balance. I realized immediately how important this deficiency would be in the brain, whose nerve cell membranes are very rich in highly oxidizable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Since the main function of vitamin E is to protect these vulnerable essential fatty acids against oxidation, a low level of vitamin E in the nerve cell membrane would invite cerebral "lipid peroxidation". Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids breaks up the fatty acid chain, and among the fragments are neurotoxic aldehyde molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidized Omega-6 fatty acids, in particular, release the highly reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), whose toxic effects on nerve synapses may account for the faulty memory seen in "Seed Oil Syndrome", described below. But 4-HNE does more than that: it activates a key enzyme involved in AD development, and may also--more importantly--mediate the impaired beta-amyloid clearance caused by cerebral lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Elena Tamagno, in Turin, has shown [Ref 6], in recent years, that 4- HNE indirectly activates the pivotal AD enzyme beta-secretase (BACE 1), a small rise in the activity of which causes a sharp increase in betaamyloid formation [S Cole, Ref 7]. Beta-amyloid is a peptide--a small protein fragment--that is the molecular cause of AD, as in rare genetic cases, where a gene mutation increases the production of a more toxic form of this peptide (the longer form, with 42 aminoacids, rather than the 40 residues seen in the much less toxic and more abundant form).</p>
<p>Although small amounts of this important protein fragment are produced in the normal brain, it is easily cleared away by degrading enzymes, and it can also exit the brain through the blood-brain barrier. However, people consuming refined vegetable oil will be forming increased beta-amyloid in abnormal oxidizing conditions, that may damage the clearance mechanism, resulting in progressive betapeptide accumulation and, ultimately, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One possibility is that lipid peroxidation products, like the same 4-HNE, might inhibit a key clearance enzyme, called Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (which also degrades beta-amyloid). In fact, an amyloid clearance problem is all that is required to cause AD, since even a mild over-production of beta-amyloid--as I postulate above--may still be successfully cleared.</p>
<p>So my theory does require a clearance defect, whether or not amyloid production is increased. And now, in 2009, Dr Y Nishida in Japan has shown [Ref 8] that by blocking vitamin E transport to mouse brain, lipid membrane peroxidation ensues, which impairs beta-amyloid clearance, by somehow reducing the expression of the gene coding for the above Insulin-Degrading Enzyme. Vitamin E-depleted seed oils, likewise, lower vitamin E levels in most tissues, causing lipid peroxidation [Y H Wang, Ref 9], which must include the brain, as shown by the early cognitive deficits seen in Harman's pioneering work (above), and their notable prevention with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Common Omega-6 seed oils, which are usually steam-deodorized, have been linked to cognitive decline in Holland [S Kalmijn, Ref 10], and also in Greece [D Psaltopoulou, Ref 11]), and to over double the risk of incident dementia (70% being AD) in the prospective "Three Cities Study" in France [P Barberger-Gateau, Ref 12]. Processed safflower oil, as discussed above, was shown many years ago (1976!) to cause memory faults in rats, which could be prevented with vitamin E. For some reason, Dr Harman did not alert the US food safety authorities to this alarming discovery.</p>
<p>Low vitamin E levels in corn, soya and safflower oils were first demonstrated by Dr David Herting in Rochester, New York State (Ref 5--see "herting d and 1963" on <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>, to find and download his free Journal of Nutrition paper). He concluded that widespread vitamin E deficiency would occur in populations consuming processed polyunsaturated seed oils. However, he did not realize the extreme peroxidation vulnerability of the brain and retina, where reduced vitamin E levels mean rapid lipid peroxidation of long-chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, in synapses and in retinal rod cell disc membranes. Had he known this, he could have predicted a new disease of the brain, with the further possibility of a new childhood brain disorder, arising in the fetal brain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It was precisely these most vulnerable tissues that were tragically ignored in the landmark nutritional study, completed in 1960 in Illinois, on which current recommended daily intake of vitamin E is based [Ref 13]. Although lead investigator Dr Max Horwitt should have been aware of the brain's rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mentioned, for example, in 1950s biochemistry texts), he judged vitamin E requirement exclusively by testing the fragility of red blood cell membranes in vitamin E-deprived human subjects, finding even greater fragility when the subjects were given vitamin E-stripped corn oil.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Horwitt to ask his vitamin E-deprived subjects about higher mental functions like memory or mood. Memory difficulties (and glare sensitivity and night-blindness from retinal damage) are likely to occur long before the red cell test becomes positive in response to gradual dietary vitamin E depletion, because the oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are much less concentrated in the red cell membrane, than in retina and brain. Lipid peroxidation is a very rapid chain-reaction, that proceeds much faster in a vitamin E-depleted cell membrane containing a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when those fatty acids--as in brain and retina--are of the long-chain variety, full of oxidizable double bonds.</p>
<p>To his credit, Horwitt did realize that the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids, so he based the recommended daily intake on the ratio of vitamin E to the intake of these fatty acids. He assumed that higher polyunsaturate intake, for example seed oil, would automatically mean higher vitamin E intake, but neglected the possibility that processed seed oils might lose some of this vitamin E during refining, and so cause some new disease specifically involving tissues prone to lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Indeed, he failed to pursue this possibility, even when he found that some members of staff at the Elgin Mental Hospital, who were not on the vitamin E deficient test diet, also had an abnormal red cell test. He did not ask himself how that could have happened, but could have taken a dietary history, and might have discovered that they were consumers of common vegetable oils, which could therefore have had something in common with his experimental stripped corn oil: low content of vitamin E. He may then have gone on to investigate the vitamin E content of such oils, and found it to be low--as David Herting found three years later, in 1963. Had Horwitt detected mild memory faults in consumers of refined seed oils, and set himself to do a little thinking, he could have nipped Alzheimer's in the bud, in 1960.</p>
<p>Any child, young person or adult consuming refined seed oils will report, if asked, memory problems, poor dark adaptation and glare sensitivity (photophobia--which is irreversible). I discovered this syndrome in general practice, and I call it Seed Oil Syndrome, and it probably reflects 4-HNE neurotoxicity in the synapses. Lipid peroxidation, which in the long term causes impaired beta-amyloid clearance, has early clinical effects due to synaptic damage: 4-HNE impairs neuronal glucose uptake, among other effects.</p>
<p>I have seen this hitherto undescribed syndrome in 100s of oil-using patients in family practice, over many years. The memory responds well to vitamin E (I sometimes add fish oil, for a faster response), except after the age of 50 or so, when subjects report long-term stability of memory, without actual improvement.</p>
<p>I am hoping that these cases, who, after some 20-30 years of refined oil exposure, may have a significant brain amyloid load, will not progress to AD, once off seed oils, and using olive oil, vitamin E and fish oil supplement. I also have some of them on Inositol, a seed sugar known to neutralize toxic Abeta oligomers [Ref 14] and improve language and orientation in established AD [Ref 15].</p>
<p>This simple glucose isomer, which is easily obtained in the diet (from grains, nuts, legumes, soymilk, cantaloupe and citrus), may prove to be a powerful weapon--along with cessation of refined-oil exposure-- in preventing Seed Oil Syndrome progressing slowly to Mild Cognitive Impairment and, ultimately, diagnosed AD. Given the extensive neuronal damage already evident in these two later stages, ultra-early prevention is now thought to be the only way to stop this disease, and nutrition--if it can do the job--is far preferable to preventive drugs.</p>
<p>From the public health angle, all cases of Seed Oil Syndrome--which is easily identified by symptoms and diet history--should change to olive oil (or any cold-pressed oil), eat a high.Inositol diet (even citrus juice is very rich in Inositol), and preferably take fish-oil capsules as well.</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake from butter, cream, cheese, fatty meat, pastries etc., must also be reduced, for it commonly causes co-morbid vascular dementia in the Alzheimer victim.</p>
<p>Inositol, given as a higher dose (5 gm/day) via supplement, also reverses anxiety disorder and depression [Ref 16], which affect perhaps 40% of AD cases. Anxiety alone doubles the risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD [Ref 17], possibly because of cortisol-induced hippocampal damage, low Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels and poor hippocampal neurogenesis. Depression, often resulting from anxiety plus fatty diet, may increase inflammation--pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1-beta may aggravate neuronal damage and increase stress axis activation even further. Anti-anxiety doses of Inositol also have a place here, by greatly decreasing stress-induced comfort-eating of fatty foods like chocolate, cheese, cakes and pastries [author's clinical observations].</p>
<p>One extra benefit from Inositol in brain disease is its unexpected antiageing effect [Ref 18], a possible example of which is the NIH 31 grain-rich mouse diet, that prolongs the median lifespan of female mice by 25% [Ref 19]. By altering the same genes that are altered by caloric restriction--including the key mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC 1 alpha--Inositol is clearly a caloric restriction mimetic, with the same potential as dietary restriction to provide neurotrophic, antioxidant and energizing benefits in brain, as described by nutritional neuroscientist Mark Mattson [Ref 20]. Already, a multiple sclerosis animal model has been found to respond well to caloric restriction [Ref 21]: Inositol is a more practical intervention.</p>
<p>Variations in AD incidence around the world (low in West Africa, very high in Wadi Ara Arabs in Israel, 4 times higher in Pittsburgh than in Ballabgarh, Northern India) probably reflect local patterns of refined seed oil consumption. In Northern India, unrefined traditional oils are still very popular (eg. pungent mustard oil, crude peanut oil), and in the South there is mostly coconut oil and crude peanut oil--and possibly an even lower AD rate.</p>
<p>Refined oils are, however, encroaching on these traditional markets. Palm oil is the main cooking oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, where AD rates may be low, but in the US and Europe--and the Middle East too-- refined oils are the rule, apart from those people lucky enough to still use mainly olive oil. A study in Bari, Italy, some years ago, showed cognitive decline in older subjects not using olive oil [Ref 22]; they were apparently using common refined supermarket seed oils, which are widely used in Italy for frying.</p>
<p>An oil that causes a serious brain disease in adult life might also be expected to affect the fetal brain: when asking many oil-using patients about symptoms of Seed Oil Syndrome, I have noticed--as a family doctor--that young adults with the syndrome frequently have children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I proceeded to do a pilot case/control study on retrospective pregnancy diet, in 80 cases versus 80 controls.</p>
<p>Almost all (78) of the mothers of ADHD cases gave a history of regular consumption of refined seed oils during all or part of the pregnancy, often from fried takeaway food. All of these mothers had permanent glare sensitivity (most carried sunglasses, usually perched conveniently on their head), and those who still consumed these oils had ongoing memory difficulties and impaired night vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have met young adults with residual ADHD, who report that their mother, if still using such oils, and now in her mid- to lateforties, has an obvious memory problem. The Scottish breath-analysis scientist Brian Ross has found evidence of lipid peroxidation (increased breath ethane gas) in some children with ADHD [Ref 23], probably due to ongoing childhood exposure to the same refined seed oils that caused their condition during gestation.</p>
<p>In my child patients, such further exposure significantly worsens the ADHD, by increasing cognitive problems, mood issues, aggression and impulsivity--all of which improve rapidly by stopping the exposure and recommending fish oil, to assist synaptic recovery and plasticity. Not only does fish oil work faster when refined oils are first excluded from the diet (to prevent peroxidative destruction of the fish oil fatty acids in vitamin E-depleted synapses), but the synaptic benefits of fish oil may be greatly enhanced by adding two more "synaptic building blocksh--uridine and choline--as proposed for Alzheimer's, by nutritional neuroscientist Dr Richard Wurtman, at the Massachusets Institute of Technology [Ref 24]. Uridine sources include brewer's yeast, broccoli and beetroot, while choline is found in egg, chicken, lecithin and wheat germ. Wurtman's "Souvenaid" synapse-restoring mixture, which increases synaptic density and cognitive function in gerbil rats, does improve Alzheimer symptoms, and may work even better in the developing ADHD brain of a young child, to the extent that usual medications for the latter disorder may become obsolete, due to advances in brain nutrition.</p>
<p>I believe there is enough evidence available to conclude that deodorized seed oils are a major public health hazard, being directly responsible for ADHD, widespread Seed Oil Syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. I notice in my clinic that Seed Oil Syndrome causes depression and irritability in anxious subjects, and aggravates ADHD in children and adolescents, promoting delinquency, serious aggression, antisocial behaviour, and substance abuse. These problems are now endemic in Western cities, and increasing world-wide.</p>
<p>Correction of all such brain peroxidation problems is very simple: to protect their citizens, while at the same time keeping these heartfriendly oils available, governments must be persuaded to pass laws requiring that all deodorized seed oils be rendered safe, with respect to their vitamin E content, before being sold. Natural vitamin E can 8 easily be recovered from the steam distillate at the food oil refinery, and replaced in the deodorized oil: or synthetic vitamin E could be used instead. Urgent action is required.</p>
<p>The highly desirable result of fixing this seed oil catastrophe would be to eliminate the twin epidemics of Alzheimer's and ADHD, along with the alarming antisocial effects of refined seed oils, as specified above.</p>
