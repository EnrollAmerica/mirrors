<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>Attached you will find a letter urging that people with Down syndrome be included in the national plan to address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia. In addition, as a parent or family member, I am aware of the need to provide special supports for caregivers, often siblings or aging parents, who assume responsibilities for the care needs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia.</p>
<p>It is also case that these individuals have special needs that may differ and require different supports than those provided to individuals in the general population. These needs have been identified by the National Task Group and Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices in an action plan it issued as part of its report: My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports", which has been submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have the need for research and population specific clinical trials identified specifically and clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as well as the care challenges they face that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports.</p>
<p>We are working with many families who are facing this very issue and the numbers are growing. As Executive Director of one of the largest Down syndrome associations in the country, and as a member of the DSAGC Health Professional Advisory Board who also serves as a consultant for the DSAGC who specializes in helping these families, we strongly urge the Council to consider the aging families who are dealing with aging children with Down syndrome who are most likely going to end up with this painful diagnosis. It is devastating diagnosis for families who have fought so hard to provide lifelong opportunities for their loved one...and then to have those opportunities taken away because of Alzheimer's disease is tragic to watch.</p>
<p>Please include us in the national study.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Comments from the Professional Affairs &amp; Information Committee, National Academy of Neuropsychology</strong></p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN), a professional association with 3,500 members dedicated to the advancement of neuropsychology as a science and health profession for the benefit of the culturally diverse patients and caregivers that we serve.</p>
<p>Clinical neuropsychologists are licensed, independent doctoral level practitioners with special expertise in the applied science of brain-behavior relationships. We provide neurocognitive assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and integrated support of culturally diverse patients (and their caregivers) suffering from a variety of neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD; cf. Goals 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the Draft HHS Plan). Our patients are referred by a variety of medical specialties. Neuropsychological assessment measures brain functioning with standardized, well-researched tests of attention, processing, memory, language, spatial, motor, sensory, and executive functions as well as social-emotional aspects of behavior and mood (cf. NINCDS-ADRDA, Goal 1 of the Draft HHS Plan). This information aids diagnosis, medical management, placement, and practical life-related patient and caregiver decisions and can stage disease progression and recovery (consequent to future biological interventions). Neuropsychologists are most often located in metropolitan areas, but many have developed part time rural practices to serve outlying communities, and consult with general clinical psychologists and primary care physicians in rural areas.</p>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the effort and diligence of the HHS staff and of the National Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in guiding the agenda for AD research and services which will positively impact the lives of the patients and caregivers that all of us serve. We would also like to thank you for including Psychology in your revised document, given the role that many psychologists play in service to AD patients and caregivers via research, education, and direct services. While neuropsychologists and psychologists share many things in common, neuropsychologists are more specialized in their knowledge of brain-behavior relationships, neuroanatomy, biological bases of cognition and behavior, standardized neurocognitive assessment, and management of neurodegenerative diseases (such as AD). Neuropsychologists frequently consult with their clinical/counseling psychologist colleagues and provide additional highly specialized diagnostic and intervention planning services for the benefit of AD patients and their caregivers. Below we will provide information regarding the critical role that neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment plays in AD diagnosis, treatment, education, and research, specifically with regard to linking biomarkers to neurobehavioral phenotypes and clinical presentation. Currently neuropsychology and neurocognitive assessment are not acknowledged in the draft HHS plan. We hope to persuade you to redress this omission.</p>
<p>We want to highlight that neuropsychologists already play an active and instrumental role in AD research (e.g., via understanding the neurocognitive and behavioral profile of the disease, determining early clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, and providing the neurocognitive clinical correlates needed for biomarker research). Neuropsychology also plays a key role in education (e.g., to other medical professionals, to patients and caregivers) and direct care of AD patients and their caregivers (e.g., innovative quality of life programs). Your acknowledgement of neuropsychology's role in the future direction of care and research in AD will help to perpetuate neuropsychology's involvement in research and innovative service programs of importance to the Alzheimer's community. Conversely, exclusion of neuropsychologists from the Draft HHS Plan may limit opportunities for neuropsychologists to remain active in AD research, education, and clinical service, and this could seriously disadvantage AD patients and caregivers who are amidst the AD experience.</p>
<p>Specifically, we seek to have neuropsychology included in (1) <strong>Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong>, which stresses the importance of the use of biological markers in the diagnosis of AD. Currently, this section of the document fails to recognize the importance of neuropsychological/neurocognitive markers of the AD phenotype that are currently the gold standard for determining the presence and progression of AD. Additionally, (2) inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct service providers (Strategy 2.A., below) is also critical to AD patients and caregivers needing this help.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>Regarding Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression, we offer the following wording suggestions for your consideration (italics ours):</p>
<p><em>Under Strategy 1.C: "Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids <strong>in relation to neuropsychological manifestations</strong> have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, ..." </em></p>
<p><em>and/or </em></p>
<p><em>Action 1.C.1: "Identify imaging and biomarkers <strong>in relation to sensitive neuropsychological measures</strong> to monitor disease progression." </em></p>
<p>In support of these suggestions we offer the following information and references:</p>
<p>Neurocognitive decline is the hallmark of AD, and according to the NIH neurocognitive assessment is essential to the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, along with clinical history (symptoms and their course), medical tests (such as blood work), and neuroimaging (<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). Also, While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for AD has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data,<sup>1,2</sup> which are hallmarks of neuropsychological evaluation at very sensitive and detailed levels.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup> Further, neuropsychologists are listed by the NIH along with Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists, and Neurologists, as specialists in assessment who can provide detailed diagnosis of AD(<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). In fact, clinical neuropsychologists often field referrals from the other three specialties mentioned by the NIH to provide very detailed assessments to assist in their patient evaluations, and often refer to the other specialists for the benefit of AD patients.</p>
<p>Neuropsychology has significantly advanced the research exploring biological markers of Alzheimer disease through the development of very sensitive neurocognitive tests; tests that are critical to early identification of neurocognitive decline (complementing Strategy 1:C of the HHS draft document).<sup>5</sup> In fact, it is not uncommon for a detailed neuropsychological evaluation to detect progressive neurocognitive decline before pathology is observed on neuroimaging such as brain MRI. Such work has assisted countless AD patients and their caregivers to enhance what time they have left, and is now being effectively used by physicians to initiate and monitor the effects of dementia delaying medications (such as cholinesterase inhibitors).</p>
<p>In the final analysis, however, there is still much that needs to be learned of the relationship between AD biomarkers and neurocognitive/functional (neuropsychological) symptoms and outcomes. As Jeffrey Cummings, M.D., noted expert on dementing conditions, has written:</p>
<p><em>The predictive relationship between biomarker changes and clinical outcomes is critical to their successful utilization in AD drug development programs. This is not known for any AD-related biomarker. Preliminary correlations have been established for some clinical outcomes and some biomarkers; it is unknown if changes in a biomarker (such as reduced MRI ventricular enlargement with treatment) will correlate with reduced decline in cognition or function following treatment (p.1482).<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p>Dr. Cummings' insightful comments lead to at least three conclusions based on the totality of biomarker research to date. First, more work needs to be done, including continued development of very sensitive standardized neuropsychological measures in relation to biomarkers for earlier identification of AD (as a clinical syndrome). Second, while there may be a correlation between biomarkers and clinical manifestations, the correlation is not perfect. Consequently, AD remains a clinical diagnosis at present, and the measurement of neurocognitive decline or enhancement (based on biological intervention) still requires detailed standardized neuropsychological assessment results (i.e., standardized and objective clinical correlates) to help press forward in biomarker research and to benefit AD sufferers. Third, neuropsychological measures are needed within the research itself as the best current means of characterizing the disease for which biomarkers are sought (i.e., neuropsychological markers remain the gold standard for biomarker research).</p>
<p><strong>2. Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct care providers: While clinical neuropsychology and clinical psychology are related, and often work together in a complementary manner in the community for the benefit of AD patients and caregivers, they are not the same specialty. Consequently, we suggest that you consider including "neuropsychologists" (along with "psychologists") as distinct additional providers within "The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease..." (Strategy 2.A.), and also in receiving HHS information regarding "...dementia curricula and practice recommendations..." (Action 2.A.3).</p>
<p>In closing, NAN again applauds your efforts to aggressively address AD, and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this endeavor. Thank you for your time in reviewing our comments. Please direct any comments, questions, or concerns to us via the NAN central office.</p>

<p>These are thoughts and quotes from people with early dementia that are actively involved as a Early Stage Advisory member at the Minnesota-North Dakota chapter. I feel it would be helpful and important to include the voice of someone with the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Advocacy:</strong></p>
<p>"Advocacy is important because you know that you are not alone in this disease." Bob PWED</p>
<p>"Early dementia is a total change in my life-loss of independence in the way I have lived my life. It is like standing on a high mountain and not knowing if I will be able to get down safely. Being an advocate for this disease gives me empowerment over this disease and hopefully others are empowered too." Julie PWED</p>
<p>"Alzheimer's is a quiet disease,people who have it often don't want to talk about it. Stating the disease can often take the shame out of the shadow and it can develop connections." Dick PWED</p>
<p>"It is important for us to be verbal about what we are experiencing. There are times of loneliness and sadness. We need the support of care partners and others. By support I mean a genuine concern and willingness to care. "Jim, PWED</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong></p>
<p>"Education helps me know what is happening to me, helps me navigate and understand this disease." Bob PWED</p>
<p>"This diagnosis hits you in the gut. Life stops for a time until someone comes my way, to help me learn a whole new life." Julie PWED</p>
<p>"More people understand the disease more clearly when it is spoken openly" Dick PWED</p>
<p><strong>Support Groups:</strong></p>
<p>"Support groups are helpful in learning and supporting one another." Bob PWED</p>
<p>"We need a time and place to learn from each other, to support each other, to learn to live again knowing that we will each hold the other up." Julie PWED</p>
<p>"Getting together with others and speaking openly about the disease opens up discussion that can be very helpful and connects us with others." Dick PWED</p>
<p><strong>Early Stage Advisory Quotes</strong></p>
<p>"It's bad enough being diagnosed," Julie said, "it feels like no one wants you anymore. I chose to get involved because I want a purpose; I want to be engaged and for my life to have meaning. I want to help others who are just like me and use the brain power I do have, for something that is good." Julie PWED</p>
<p>"You have to understand, life doesn't stop with diagnosis," Jim said. "This group is a testament to what it's like to live with this disease." He smiled. "And right now, this is the best period of my life. I'm going to enjoy it." Jim, PWED</p>
<p>"We can change the world." Mike said. "My goal is to eradicate this disease so my children never have to deal with it again." Jim, Dick and Julie all nod in agreement. Mike, PWED</p>
<p>"We're the new faces of Alzheimer's," Dick said. "And we're choosing to make a difference." Dick, PWED</p>
<p>"We don't just have a disease," Dick said, the newest member of the Minnesota-North Dakota Early Stage Advisory Group. "We live the disease. And while I've accepted that this is a part of me, I'm not going to let it define who I am."</p>
<p>"We're the same people we were yesterday," Julie said. "We haven't changed and it's important others know."</p>

<p>On behalf of the Alliance for Aging Research, we thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Alliance for Aging Research, <a href="http://www.agingresearch.org">http://www.agingresearch.org</a>, is a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace of medical discoveries to improve the universal experience of aging and health. Our work in Alzheimer's disease includes chairing the Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition that brings together stakeholders to accelerate development of new treatments; and as an active member of the Leaders Engaged in Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) coalition, serving as co-chair of its research and drug development workgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You and Introduction </strong></p>
<p>We would like to first thank and praise the Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its swift implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In only 14 months since President Obama signed the legislation into law, HHS has appointed the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, convened the council three times, and developed both a draft framework and draft national plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, we would like to thank you for the Obama Administration's commitment of a $50 million boost in immediate funding for Alzheimer's disease research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 and for the $80 million increase in the President's fiscal 2013 budget. The announcement about the availability of these funds marks a historic moment for the country. No previous administration has proposed a research increase specific to this dreaded disease. In addition, the initiative also includes a much-needed increase of $26 million for FY 2013 to enhance support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers as well as education for providers and the general public.</p>
<p>We praise HHS for recognizing the importance of the larger demographic shift in the U.S. aging population as a motivator for success of the National Plan, which states:</p>
<p><em>NAPA offers a historic opportunity to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given the great demographic shifts that will occur over the next 30 years, including the doubling of the population of older adults, the success of this effort is of great importance to people with AD and their family members, public policy makers, and health and social service providers. </em></p>
<p>The Alliance believes that increased investment in preventing, treating or curing chronic diseases of the aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, is perhaps the single most effective strategy in reducing national spending on healthcare. As you are aware, eighty percent of seniors have at least one major chronic condition and half have two or more. Chronic diseases associated with aging account for more than 75 percent of Medicare and other federal health expenditures. Unprecedented increases in age-related diseases as the population ages are one reason the Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on healthcare will rise to 25 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025 from 17 percent today. Simply put, our nation does not have the luxury of time to address the health research needs of this population.</p>
<p>The Alliance recognizes that fiscal restraints are required in the current economic climate, and that the Administration has already extended itself to support Alzheimer's disease funding in the National Plan. However, one of our overall comments is that <strong>funding lines must be developed and additional resources provided to adequately meet the goals of an otherwise ambitious plan</strong>. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) specifically, and NIH in general, will need a funding commitment in the billion dollar range to meet the defined 2025 goal to "prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease"; FDA will need an increase of hundreds of millions to accelerate the regulatory process and promote innovation in the development of Alzheimer's disease treatments; and other agencies from AoA to CMS and HRSA will need additional resources to meet Alzheimer's-specific objectives identified in the plan that are expected to occur in conjunction with implementation of Affordable Care Act programs. The Alliance suggests that HHS create a detailed chart of current (within the next fiscal year) expected federal/private investment in each area and costs associated with meeting each goal and strategy within the plan. Otherwise, a majority of these activities look to be unfunded mandates for federal programs with already limited resources.</p>
<p>Second, the Alliance is pleased that HHS has recognized the data gaps that exist for Alzheimer's disease and has additionally committed $1.3 million for FY 2013 to address them. HHS' use of NIA-generated, peer-reviewed, figures for Alzheimer's disease prevalence is monumental. While seemingly academic, the identification and development of reliable data is the necessary starting point for accurate needs assessment and programmatic response. <strong>Data development is a cornerstone of the plan that the Alliance believes should be integrated throughout each goal as well as remain its own goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Last, the Alliance was disappointed that this draft plan did not include the inventory conducted by the federal interagency working group. It is challenging to comment on the goals and strategies of the draft plan when the rationale behind them is not included as a resource. We understand that this was the first inventory conducted and that certain federal regulations must be met before presenting it in a clear format for the public. However, we wanted to note the issue and <strong>strongly recommend that future draft plans include the inventory to allow for more informed public comment</strong>.</p>
<p>The comments below are organized by the goals and strategies identified in the plan in specific areas where we felt the Alliance had expertise and that were not already being addressed in comments submitted by the research and drug development workgroup that the Alliance co-chairs through LEAD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The Alliance praises HHS for setting a goal of 2025 to "develop effective prevention and treatment modalities." We believe that setting this goal makes sense for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NAPA legislation expires in 2025. Goal setting is valuable for mobilizing policymakers and the advocacy community, motivating researchers and industry, and galvanizing public attention and awareness of the issue. The Alliance feels strongly that HHS and NIH should be clear with the public in particular about the state of Alzheimer's disease research to manage expectations. We hope that the upcoming May Alzheimer's Research Summit will include an explanation of this goal that will be captured by the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></em></p>
<p>The Alliance is very supportive of this particular action to "examine ways to speed up the processes for bringing pharmacological treatments to market, including: identifying and validating therapeutic targets; developing new interventions: testing efficacy and safety; and regulatory approval." In fact, the Alliance spearheaded a coalition effort, Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition, <a href="http://www.act-ad.org">http://www.act-ad.org</a>, in 2006 to accomplish similar goals. <strong>HHS should consult with ACT-AD as it moves ahead with this action</strong>.</p>
<p>ACT-AD is a coalition of nearly 50 national non-profit health professional, patient, health provider and consumer organizations seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. ACT-AD's mission is to support accelerating research for transformational therapies to potentially slow, halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Until the formation of the ACT-AD Coalition, there was no point of advocacy combining the perspectives and commitment of respected advocates for women's health, consumer interests, caregiver support groups and aging interested organizations. ACT-AD is strengthened by the diversity and credibility of those voices and is bringing that strength to bear on critical issues concerning the development, review and approval of a new generation of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Under the current regulatory environment, research being performed today cannot reach patients in time to avert this disaster. CNS drugs take, on average, 13 years from initial animal studies of a drug candidate to approval. A delay of one year negatively impacts the lives of nearly 333,000 patients and their families. While these figures underscore the urgency of seeking more effective therapeutic interventions for patients with Alzheimer's disease, there are promising treatments being tested that may slow, halt or reverse Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The ACT-AD Coalition works with urgency to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The methods the Coalition uses to conduct its important work include:</p>
<ul><li>Educating healthcare professionals, providers and other key constituencies about ways to focus the attention of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials and other decision makers about the need to expedite Alzheimer's disease treatments in the crowded landscape of those vying for consideration and action.</li>
<li>Advancing ACT-AD's profile with the Food and Drug Administration officials and other key influencers and audiences as an organization that has critical mass and strategic focus to sustain a long-term commitment to improving the regulatory review of Alzheimer's disease drugs.</li>
<li>Initiating efforts to build support for FDA reform among key Congressional leaders who influence appropriations necessary for Agency reform.</li>
<li>Developing needed research and link Alzheimer's disease expertise to the Food and Drug Administration in order to support their efforts to prioritize drug review with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary base of facts.</li>
<li>Mobilizing support and pressure upon the Food and Drug Administration from outside the agency, especially through ACT-AD member organizations and collaborations with other third-party organizations.</li>
<li>Engaging the caregiver population that continues to be overburdened and unfocused on the need for political and regulatory reform.</li>
</ul><p>The ACT-AD Coalition holds periodic meetings with its members and representatives of the Food and Drug Administration. Scientific workshop topics have included clinical meaningfulness and Phase II trial issues--and the focus is always on areas relating to an open dialogue between the Food and Drug Administration and Alzheimer's disease community to advance efforts to combat the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>Our nation faces an impending healthcare crisis as the number of older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other complex health needs increasingly outpaces the number of healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to adequately care for them. If current workforce trends do not change, we will continue to fail to ensure that every older American is able to receive high-quality care. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) April 2008 report, "Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce," calls for immediate investments in enhancing the geriatric competencies of the entire workforce, increasing the recruitment and retention of geriatric specialists and caregivers, and improving the way that care for older adults is delivered.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>First, direct-care workers provide critical support to older adults in need of long-term care, providing eight out of every ten hours of paid service delivered.<sup>2</sup> This field, which is increasing at three times the rate of other jobs within the United States economy, provides the best opportunity for caring individuals to obtain vital employment positions.<sup>3</sup> There is also a significant shortage of health professionals and direct-care workers with specialized training in geriatrics and an even greater shortage of the geriatrics faculty needed to train the entire workforce. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions programs are the <strong>only</strong> federal programs that increase the number of faculty with geriatrics expertise in a variety of disciplines and offer critically important geriatrics training to the entire healthcare workforce. Title VIII Geriatrics Nursing Workforce Development Programs are the primary source of federal funding for advanced education nursing, workforce diversity, nursing faculty loan programs, nurse education, practice and retention, comprehensive geriatric education, loan repayment, and scholarship.</p>
<p>The $6 million investment by the Administration for "provider education and outreach" will barely scratch the surface in addressing shortages in geriatric workforce and training outlined in actions under Strategy 2.A. <strong>Much more substantial investment is needed to fund the recommendations by IOM and we suggest that HHS revisit that report and the three others that came before it</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if more students enter geriatrics training, incentivizing them to stay will require loan forgiveness options. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S. 1095, the "Caring for an Aging America Act" that <strong>would amend the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) requirements to add geriatrics and gerontology to the permanent eligibility</strong>. This small change in the language governing eligibility for NHSC loans would mean that geriatrics and gerontology specialists would always be eligible for NHSC loans as opposed to the current situation which is that these geriatrics and gerontology specialists can only participate in the program if the HHS Secretary so designates it. An additional advantage is that <strong>the loan forgiveness would be fully funded through the NHSC</strong>.</p>
<p>By 2030, our nation will require 3.5 million additional healthcare professionals and direct-care workers to fulfill the growing demand for care. <strong>The National Health Care Workforce Commission, established by the Affordable Care Act, will play a central role in formulating a national strategy for bolstering the healthcare workforce in order to meet the needs of the escalating number of older Americans</strong>. There is no mention of the commission in Strategy 2A.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services </strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the use of warning signs to promote early detection by providers and patients may create confusion in the public. Warning signs for Alzheimer's disease have not been validated and are not promoted as screening instruments; however, concern has been raised that individuals experiencing cognitive deficits and their families may treat warning sign lists as a screening tool.<sup>4</sup><strong>Although warning signs are publicized by several national organizations for educational purposes, they are not a substitute for a structured screening or consultation with a primary care provider</strong>. Further, the utility of these warning signs is questionable since the individuals in whom these problems are first noticed are frequently well into a dementia course. In addition:</p>
<ul><li>Most of the warning signs may be indicative of a number of other health issues, including everything from depression (changes in mood/personality) to transient ischemic attack (problems with language/disorientation). There is often no mention that these warning signs may indicate other conditions.</li>
<li>By the time any one or more of the warning signs presents the individual may be in the early moderate/moderate stage at best so "early detection" is a misnomer.</li>
<li>Warning signs may be useful in raising public awareness about Alzheimer's disease. However, elevating warning signs to an early detection tool and then placing the onus of recognition on those with the illness and their loved ones is not sound policy--especially given that anosognosia (unawareness of a problem of cognition in oneself, usually to the point of vigorously denying the problem) is a common symptom for individuals with the disease.</li>
<li>Moreover, promoting the use of warning signs among individuals and family caregivers may serve as a disincentive to providers to learn more about proper, proactive detection methods.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes </strong></p>
<p>Behavioral issues are a main reason that psychoactive medications are administered in long-term care settings, which may result in increased falls, increased mortality and increased confusion. There has been increased focus on the use of "atypical" antipsychotic medications in particular, after FDA introduced its black box warning in 2005 and for "conventional" antipsychotics in 2008 for patients with dementia.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In May 2011 the HHS Office of the Inspector General released a report Medicare Atypical Antipsychotic Drug Claims for Elderly Nursing Home Residents," which found that over a six month period from January-June 2007, 51 percent of Medicare claims for atypical antipsychotic drugs were erroneous, amounting to $116 million.<sup>6</sup> The report found that over 726,000 of the 1.4 million atypical antipsychotic drug claims for elderly nursing home residents did not comply with Medicare reimbursement criteria. The claimed drugs were either not used for medically accepted indications as supported by the compendia or not documented as having been administered to the elderly nursing home residents. The OIG report concludes "We suggest that CMS either use its existing authority or seek new statutory authority to <em>prevent payment</em> [emphasis added] and hold nursing homes responsible for submitting claims for drugs that are not administered according to CMS's standards regarding unnecessary drug use in nursing homes."</p>
<p>The two main reasons for overuse of antipsychotics in nursing home residents with dementia are 1) understaffing and 2) lack of training. Required staff ratios have been suggested for years by nursing home advocates but Congress is reluctant to touch the issue. Training was somewhat addressed in the Affordable Care Act as part of the Nursing Home Transparency provisions, but the training section only applies to nursing assistants--not supervisors. <strong>Dementia training for nursing home staff should apply to nursing supervisors as well as assistants</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes the issue even more complicated is that there is valid use for antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. A September 2011 report, a comparative effectiveness review prepared for AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program by the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center, based at the RAND Corporation, found statistically significant evidence for risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, for the off-label indications of dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>There are provisions in the Nursing Home Reform Law, enacted in 1987, that clearly define appropriate use of psychoactive drugs, circumstances when antipsychotic drugs should be limited and provides for review of a patients drug regimen. CMS guidance to surveyors in the State Operations Manual8also encourages facilities to use non-pharmacological alternatives, identifies situations where antipsychotic medications are not indicated,9 and provides an investigative protocol for unnecessary drugs, including antipsychotic drugs. Despite these strong provisions antipsychotic drug use remains a serious concern, in part because the law, regulations, and surveyor guidance are inadequately and ineffectively enforced. <strong>Stronger enforcement of these standards would make an enormous difference</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>As HHS considers ways to strengthen its National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, the Alliance looks forward to working with you. Thank you for considering our views, and please do not hesitate to contact Alliance for Aging Research Director of Public Policy Cynthia Bens if you have any questions or would like additional information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Input on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>GE Healthcare appreciates this opportunity to provide input and comments on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Our comments focus on the use of diagnostics to help physicians diagnose and treat disease and to reduce the burden of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias on patients and their caregivers.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare, a division of the General Electric Company, has decades of expertise in medical imaging and information technologies, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, performance improvement, drug discovery, and biopharmaceuticals manufacturing technologies. GE Healthcare's broad range of products and services enables healthcare providers to offer patients earlier and better diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart disease, neurological diseases, and other conditions that threaten the quality and length of life. Worldwide, GE Healthcare employs more than 53,000 people committed to serving healthcare professionals and their patients in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Comments</strong></p>
<p>Our comments and recommendations focus on the following issues:</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis, Monitor, Treatment and Prevention</strong>: The magnitude of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the US is overwhelming; Alzheimer's disease affects 1 in every 8 older Americans and nearly half of those ages 85 and older. As the number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias grows in the future, aggregate payments for their care will increase dramatically from $183 billion in 2011 to an estimated staggering $1.1 trillion by 2050.</p>
<p>While an estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, the Alzheimer's Association reports that half of them lack a specific diagnosis. This represents a fundamental gap that is identified in the Draft National Plan. To address this gap, the Plan calls for increased efforts to identify disease, diagnose AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p>New diagnostic technologies suggest benefits in early screening and utility in determining treatment pathways. Specific diagnostic tests including brain imaging may aid practitioners and caregivers to implement care plans early in the disease process.</p>
<p>For treatment decisions, new diagnostic imaging technologies may help inform and guide healthcare providers when making decisions ranging from pharmacologic choices to duration of therapy. In addition, technological advancements in diagnostics using brain imaging may serve useful in drug development as they allow researchers to stratify patient populations according to the extent and anatomic distribution of pathophysiology and then to measure the effect of tehapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>For non-medical purposes, diagnostic tests offer patients and caregivers information that may enable the initiation of preventive measures like exercise (both cognitive and physical), time to make life planning decisions and understanding of the course of the disease.</p>
<p>Because AD progresses in the brain for as long as a decade before classic signs and symptoms become clear to diagnosticians, early detection of the pathophysiology is crucial to effective intervention and better health for those affected.</p>
<p><strong>GE Healthcare's Effort To Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD)</strong>: For decades, GE Healthcare has invested heavily in R&amp;D to bring to market an increasing number of molecular medical diagnostic products; companies like GE Healthcare translate scientific and medical discoveries into innovative products and services that add objectivity to clinical trials and every day practice of medicine to help physicians prescribe the right drug at a dose which is right for their patients.</p>
<p>By example, these advances have begun to change the paradigm for treatment of diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Access To New Technologies</strong>: While predictive testing and risk assessment have evolved rapidly over the past decade, the adoption of new diagnostic imaging procedures comes with challenges. GE Healthcare is pleased that cognitive testing has been added to the routine physical exam in Medicare as a screening tool. Nevertheless, the benefits of new brain imaging or molecular imaging diagnostic tests have not been widely recognized by payers that see limited value in early diagnosis when treatment choices are limited. We support the many action items included in the draft plan that will accelerate the development and adoption of important diagnostic imaging tools.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: We encourage the inclusion of action items in the Plan that stress the need for Medicare to provide access to the health benefits of diagnostic imaging technologies, as well as other innovative technologies while under a doctor's care within the practice of medicine.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare also supports the draft Plan's focus on accelerating research aimed at preventing, diagnosing and treating this debilitating disease, and strengthening care quality and efficiency of care both before and after new treatments become available. Patients and their caregivers deserve no less.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare very much appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on these important issues and looks forward to HHS and the Advisory Council's final recommendations in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. If you have any questions on our comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Merck &amp; Company, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Merck is an innovative, global health care leader that is committed to preserving and improving human life. We continue to focus our research on conditions that affect millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>We commend you and the Advisory Council on the first Draft of the National Plan. The plan is comprehensive in scope and addresses many of the most significant challenges to changing the course of Alzheimer's disease in the US and globally. As indicated in the Draft Plan, we encourage you to make subsequent iterations of the Plan far more specific, and to give a practical sense of what can be accomplished not only through government action but by bringing government, industry, and academia together to align and build on each other's already substantial activities on Alzheimer's disease. We applaud the government's leadership in organizing and hosting the Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in May to bring a wide array of stakeholders to the table, and we look forward to participating in this meeting.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Goal I</strong></p>
<p>We are particularly pleased with the first Goal of the Draft Plan: to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. Only by setting such a challenging goal and by allocating sufficient resources and aligning critical partners can we hope to achieve such an important global public health outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Broad Collaboration Needed</strong></p>
<p>This is not a goal the US federal government can accomplish solely through its own actions or by directing the actions of others, particularly in light of the limited resources currently at its disposal. Rather this is a goal that all of us committed to a breakthrough in Alzheimer's disease must chare; and must, indeed, share with our colleagues around the world. It will take a true partnership of research, business, advocates, health care and government and the combined resources of all parties to develop and apply the needed therapeutics at the rate required to attain this goal.</p>
<p>Leadership is critical, and the government, through this Plan and its funding and convening powers, can to do much to provide that leadership. Achieving key milestones in advancing therapeutics will require a collaboration of government, academia, and industry.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Partnership Is Essential</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Streamlining Regulatory Pathways</strong></p>
<p>While the Draft Plan proposes a number of areas in which greater collaboration with industry can be productive, there are a number of proposed actions where more constructive engagement of industry could be helpful. Specifically, Action 1.E.1 to identify ways to accelerate time to market, should engage industry as a full partner in identifying ways to simplify the approval process, provide greater clarity and predictability in validation and application of diagnostics and biomarkers and in the selection of endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>In Establishing New Approval Standards</strong></p>
<p>Currently, efficacy can only be established in large and lengthy clinical trials. Advances in knowledge of disease pathophysiology, risk factores, and disease biomarkers through academic, government and industry sponsored research is critical to develop more efficient new approaches for clinical trials. Industry should be directly involved in an ongoing dialogue with the FDA on how to translate the rapidly evolving science of Alzheimer's disease into standards for establishing safety and efficacy of treatments. Developing new approaches that can be used to shorten this timeline and remove risk earlier will require the combined efforts of industry and the FDA. Collaboration with the EMA and other major regulatory bodies will be essential as well to ensure global consistency in the translation of science into regulatory pathways to get therapeutics to patients.</p>
<p><strong>In Accounting for Different Disease Segments</strong></p>
<p>Imaging and biomarker development in Strategy 1 C should contribute to clear differentiation by the FDA of segments of disease -- prevention, early treatment and later treatment -- which have different issues and may have different pathways for approval. For each segment, the FDA will need to provide guidance on acceptable diagnostic criteria and clinical end-points needed to prove efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>In Designing and Conducting Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>Clinical trial design and conduct is another area where much can be gained from a true partnership with academia and industry. Action 1.B.5 proposes that HHS, VA, and NIA develop and fund clinical trials on the most promising therapeutics. This Action does not account for the amount of time and effort, and the amount of uncertainty that is involved in finding safe therapeutic candidates and testing these mechanisms in trials. Nor does it acknowledge the existence of the substantial infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and the relationships that already exist with regulators to ensure that medicines are approved. This is an infrastructure today fully engaged in developing the more than 100 Alzheimer's disease candidates currently in the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency Needed in Research</strong></p>
<p>It is important in Strategy 1 B in expanding the research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, to ensure the most efficient use of all partners and resources, and make the best use of the limited number of patients that will be available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms and produce evidence of brain target engagement to avoid studies that confuse the field and do not advance the state of knowledge, in order to make the best use of patients that enter clinical trials.</p>
<p>Again, we commend you on the progress to date on this important project. We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We look forward to the opportunity to remain fully engaged in this important mission of developing an effective prevention and treatment for Alzheimer's disease by 2025.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit written comments for the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as part of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, our aging network formed an interagency workgroup to discuss the draft and make recommendations. The following agencies and their representatives were asked for their input:</p>
<p>Aging Services Division (ASD) Division Director<br />
					ASD Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) Project Director<br />
					ASD Policy and Strategic Planning Supervisor<br />
					Oklahoma Health Care Authority representative (the state Medicaid agency)<br />
					ASD Home and Community-Based Services Program Administrator<br />
					Adult Protective Services Program Administrator<br />
					OKDHS Developmental Disabilities Division Director<br />
					ASD Older Americans Act Program Administrator<br />
					Oklahoma Mental Health Advocacy Coalition Director<br />
					ASD Legal Services Developer<br />
					ASD State Long Term Care Ombudsman</p>
<p>Many of these individuals also served on Oklahoma's task force to study and make recommendations regarding the effect of Alzheimer's Disease in our state. This task force, co-chaired by Senator Tom Ivester and Representative David Dank, met over a year and filed a final report which can be found here: <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/publications/issue_papers/health_social_services/effect_of_alzheimers_task_force_final_report.pdf">http://www.oksenate.gov/publications/issue_papers/health_social_services/effect_of_alzheimers_task_force_final_report.pdf</a></p>
<p>Our group focused on Goals 2, 3, and 4 of the national draft plan.</p>
<p>General Thoughts:</p>
<p>Our group felt inclusion of the existing aging network is necessary for the success of the national plan. The aging network, through the above listed agencies and programs, already works with family caregivers, documents existing service gaps, and disseminates information statewide. Our statewide ADRC program already works to help families and caregivers to meet current needs and plan for future ones. Our Older Americans Act services specially target those individuals and their families who are facing an Alzheimer's diagnosis through the National Family Caregiver Support Program. Including the aging network would help to optimize existing resources and coordinate implementation of the plan's objectives. Our overarching concern is the aging network and its involvement in the rollout of this plan.</p>
<p>Specific Comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The draft plan references a Research Summit in May 2012 (pg. 7). We were curious if that has been scheduled, who will be participating, what will come out of that summit that could be used and in what way, etc. Likewise, the Federal Interagency Working Group referenced in the plan could be heavily leveraged to support change needed at the state level. Have the members of that group been chosen? What are differences between that group and the to-be-assembled leadership team referenced on pg. 29?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really liked the references in both plans for 1) veterans 2) private sector. The private sector piece has limitless opportunity. Finally, we think for anything meaningful to happen -- either at the national or state level -- you must see legislative involvement and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Oklahoma we have recognized the importance of providing case management to inform and coordinate services available to caregivers and their families and would like to see it as a cornerstone of services under this plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oklahoma's Aging Services Division works with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and would like to see the unique needs of older prisoners addressed: (1) For those who are incarcerated, we would like to see specialized training in dementia information for prison personnel and comparative treatment options and (2) For those who have been released, more "safety net" provisions since these individuals are less likely to have a family/friend support network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would like the plan to include the following action items under a new Strategy 3.F:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.F</strong>. Provide leadership in understanding legal issues, including legal opportunities and obstacles faced by persons with Alzheimer's Disease, their family members and caregivers. Legal issues of persons with Alzheimer's Disease emerge as the progression of the disease continues. Prompt and early legal intervention, prior to the onset of incapacity, can relieve stress on family members and caregivers who must deal with the consequences of lack of legal planning as capacity continues to diminish. AOA's Legal Services Developers in each state address the development of local legal services and ensure that education is available to inform persons with Alzheimer's Disease, their family members and caregivers about legal options.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3F.1</strong>. Provide information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues during life of the person with Alzheimer's Disease as capacity diminishes. HHS will prioritize the dissemination of legal information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues during life of the person with Alzheimer's Disease. HHS will encourage state and local entities to work with local attorneys and legal providers to offer information related to the issues of capacity for decision making along the continuum of the progression of the disease; the uses and abuses of powers of attorney for finances and health care; the execution of advance directives, including living wills, do not resuscitate consent forms and the appointment of health care proxies; the process of legal guardianship that enables caregivers or family members to make decisions regarding the care of the person and/or the finances of the person Alzheimer's disease, and the appropriate use of "least restrictive" means to preserve the dignity of the person with Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.F.2</strong>. Provide information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues upon the death of the person with Alzheimer's Disease. HHS also recognizes that the need for quality information regarding legal issues upon the death of the person with Alzheimer's Disease is paramount. HHS will work with states to engage local attorneys and legal providers in providing information related to estate planning documents and techniques including the execution of a will and the process of probate that addresses the need to name an executor and beneficiaries; estate planning techniques that may be available in states to avoid probate including living trusts; transfer on death and payable on death documents and deeds; and the use and abuse of joint tenancy as an estate planning tool with finances and real property.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, I am writing in support of the proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders (ADRD) that would promote an earlier diagnosis of the disease, improve strategies for long term services and supports, and accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging was created by the State Legislature in 1973 for the purpose of improving the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the single State agency authorized to receive and dispense Federal Older Americans Act funds and is mandated to provide a comprehensive coordinated service system for the State's 2.2 million older persons, giving high priority to those in greatest need. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network, caregivers and persons with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, an estimated 222,300 individuals in Illinois are living with Alzhiemer's disease with a direct and indirect financial toll of $5.2 billion. More than 70% of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease are living at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to assist care recipients with Activities of Dailiy Living (ADLs) than caregivers to other persons.<sup>(1)</sup> Caregivers often help to manage other serious medical conditions in addition to Alzheimer's, and because Alzheimer's and other dementia usually progress slowly, most caregivers spend many years in the caregiving role.<sup>(2)</sup> In 2006 the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Family Caregiver Association reported an estimated 1.2 million family caregivers in Illinois were providing 1.3 million hours of care to family members. As the baby boom generation enters the age of greatest risk for Alzheimer's, by 2025 their number in Illinois is expected to increase to over 239,000.</p>
<p>Thirteen Area Agencies on Aging and statewide service providers comprise the Aging Network in Illinois, which effectively links older persons with needed services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP), implemented through the Aging Nework, provides five basic service categories to family caregivers including: information about services; assistance in accessing services; counseling; support groups and trianing/education; respite care; and, supplemental services.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, 66,132 Illinoisans received assistance through services of the NFCSP. Additionally, 493,313 individuals received assistance through supportive and nutrition services of the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>The proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders contains thoughtful recommendations which address the immediate and long-term needs of caregivers, providers and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Aging Network in Illinois is committed to providing services to Alzheimer patients, their families and caregivers through a number of programs which support the five goals of the National Plan.</p>
<ul><li>Public Education and Outreach: Through Title III-B efforts under the Older Americans Act and Title III-E programs of the National Family Caregiver Support Program the Aging Network provided education and outreach on aging issues and available resources to 6,429 individuals in FY 2011. Additionally, the Department collaborates with many professional organizations to provide education and training opportunities. Examples include the Annual Elder Rights Conference; Senior Expos; Area Agencies on Aging sponsored Lunch and Learn/Brown Bag events; Caregiver Conferences; AIRS (Alliance of Information and Referral Systems) training; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Older Caregiver Training.</li>
<li>Outreach to healthcare providers: Home and community-based resources are critical to ensure that persons living with Alzheimer's disease are adequately and safely cared for in their homes as long as possible and contain the cost of health care. The Illinois Department on Aging sponsors many conferences and workshops for professionals including the Community Care Program/Case Coordination Unit Annual Supervisor Conference convening supervisors from case coordination units and home care agencies; the Annual Governor's Conference on Aging and Illinois TRAID comprised of state and local law enforcement agencies and other professional organizations. The Department also promotes the use of the Administration on Aging's National Alzheimer's Call Center by caregivers and encourages referrals by AAAs and providers.</li>
<li>Expanded support for people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers in the community: The Department has aggressively pursued funding to expand and enhance services for caregivers. In 2009 the Administration on Aging awarded the Department a three year Lifespan Respite grant which has enhanced access to and improved awareness of respite services. The Department has established a statewide Caregiver Advisory Committee which convenes regularly to discuss caregiver issues, share resources and best practices and review caregiver programs and is establishing protocol to implement and effective service delivery system through Aging and Disability Resource Centers/Coordinated Points of Entry.</li>
<li>Improved data collection and analysis: The Department works closely with the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging to collect data for NAPIS reporting as well as reviewing current caregiver assessment tools.</li>
</ul><p>In 2009, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Related Dementia State Plan - Senate Joint Resolution 43 - Report to the Governor and General Assembly." Recommendations in this report are reflected in the National Plan and include:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing adequate staffing levels and funding</li>
<li>Establishing basic and specialized education and training for persons when responsibilities make it likely they will come into contact with persons with AD and related dementias and their caregivers</li>
<li>Facilitate planning, treatment and research</li>
<li>Provide assistance to unpaid caregivers of persons with AD</li>
<li>Determine an effective system to collect data</li>
</ul><p>We must continue to examine our current capability to meet the Alzheimer's crisis and propose action to prepare for and respond to these challenges which include the development of a standardized caregiver assessment; establishment of the ADRC service delivery model; continue collaborative efforts of the Lifespan Respite Program; continue to incorporate consumer directed care service models through the National Family Caregiver Support Program; continue to collaborate with the Alzheimer's Association in Illinois; utilize Area Agencies on Aging and service providers to disseminate information and provide culturally sensitive training and materials to providers and caregivers; assist families and individuals in planning for future needs and provide updates to families, caregivers and providers regarding the latest clinical guidelines and information on how to work with people with AD; examine the capacity of public safety and law enforcement to respond to person's with Alzheimer's; examination of trends in the Alzheimer's population and needs, including assistance to persons with early stage and early on-set Alzheimer's and persons with Alzheimer's and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging and the Aging Network is committed to continue to respond in the most appropriate and effective way to this growing health problem and meet the challenge of providing service to Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers. The proposed National Plan is sensitive to local efforts to support caregivers and direct-care workers and offers viable proposals to support, educate and train the direct-care workforce and state aging workforces.

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>While the Draft National Alzheimer's Plan mentions nonpharmacological treatments and initiatives for dementia, it does so in a way that enables these important initiatives to be easily sidelined through lack of funding, lack of understanding and inappropriate research.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that the unique and positive alternative paradigm of nonpharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's must be recognized. This paradigm has several key dimensions that the National Alzheimer's Plan must recognize as a legitimate treatment modality for Alzheimer's and related dementias that can significantly improve the lives of those with these conditions and can significantly reduce costs in the care and treatment of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>The following must be recognized and included in the plan if these significant care options are to be valued as they clearly need to be so the many millions of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias today and tomorrow receive the quality of life and human rights they deserve.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><em>A DIFFERENT PARADIGM<br />
							Nonpharmacological interventions represent a global paradigm of Alzheimer's treatment; much more than just individual actions such as chocolate, dolls, and environmental design. This paradigm, based on neuroscience theory, applied research, and clinical practice, has been developed by many experts over decades. If this powerful approach to dealing with dementia and reducing symptoms is to be taken seriously, the particulars, no matter how exceptional (such as museum programs for people with Alzheimer's, providing improvisational theatre, or giving chocolate), need to be taken as examplars of a larger way of thinking about Alzheimer's and dementia--a new paradigm--not as ends in themselves. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE<br />
							There is a huge cache of evidence-based knowledge demonstrating how non-pharmacological interventions reduce symptoms and improve daily lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. This research is often discounted and rejected because although it is meaningful and fits the needs of the evaluation being conducted, it does not fit a particular research model--the double blind randomized controlled trial. It is important to assess these data carefully to calculate the statistical effect sizes they represent and thus their impact on people's lives. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>METHODOLOGY AND METHODS<br />
							Much existing research is discounted by policymakers, researchers, and others because they are convinced that the only evidence worth counting is generated by double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs represent one important way to generate knowledge; but only one way. Other methodologies contribute substantially to our knowledge of nonpharmacological interventions and need to be taken seriously. It makes little sense to discredit a large body of knowledge that could immensely help policy and decision-making. The following summarizes two alternative ways to think about research methodology. </em></p>
<p><em>The RCT gold standard assumes that 1. It is the highest level of proof, no matter what the research question, 2. It is at the top of a hierarchy of methods where other methodologies are "lower" on the continuum, and 3. That statistical significance is a measure of meaningfulness of a finding. </em></p>
<p><em>The alternative gold standard for nonpharmacological and other research assumes that 1. The best methodology for any research question is the methodology that fits the question best--not any particular one, 2. There is no single continuum of methodology and no absolute hierarchy, and. 3. That effect measures are an important addition to statistical significance as a measure of a finding's "meaningfulness." </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
							Freedom to choose, getting what you want, being part of the larger society and taking part in cultural activities are human rights everyone deserves--including those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. We ought to be shocked at the limits to human rights being imposed daily on those with dementia (no chocolate and no visits to museums) rather than amazed that human rights are being respected in a few places--Arizona, or New York, or Massachusetts or wherever. </em></p>
<p><em>The World Health Organization defines the rights of all people as dignity, independence, self-fulfillment, participation and care. Respecting these for people living with Alzheimer's could well be a rallying cry for those who care about people living with this condition.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>THE WAY OUT OF THE ETHICAL DILEMMA OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS<br />
							In the name of science and further research, there is a movement taking place to diagnose Alzheimer's disease long before those being diagnosed show any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although these tests are presented as limited to research purposes, they are highly likely to be employed in everyday practice. For the millions who will receive this early diagnosis tomorrow and the millions living with this dementia diagnosis today, early diagnosis presents a major ethical dilemma: What to do with a diagnosis if no medications are available that stop the progress of the disease? The nonpharmacological paradigm and its associated interventions represent an ethical way to respond to the call for early Alzheimer's diagnosis since they offer a clear solution to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. </em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>For these reasons, we urge that an expert and champion of nonpharmacological approaches and treatments for dementia be appointed to generate research, direct information gathering and otherwise serve the needs of those with dementia today employing nonpharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and others administering research programs for dementia to include on an equal basis in all research, both nonpharmacological treatments and pharmacological ones. By nonpharmacological "treatments" we mean all health related activities that research has demonstrated have positive behavioral and health outcomes. These include, among others: engaging activity, exercise, targeted nutrition, music, visual arts, film, drama, museums, an appropriately designed and stimulating environment, memory books, high-touch end of life care, external written cueing, information technology, training family and formal caregivers, counseling, meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, poetry, storytelling, pets, and even chocolate.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and those administering Alzheimer's-focused research programs and Alzheimer's-focused intervention strategies to develop and make explicit key performance indicators suited to nonpharmacological interventions. We also urge them to include in research protocols all evaluation methods and methodologies suited to studying the effects of real-world applications of nonpharmacological treatments. We urge that all research involving treatment of dementia, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, include reporting the clinical significance of effects produced by treatments, as well as statistical significance.</p>

<p>APA is eager to collaborate with the Advisory Council, federal agencies, and other organizations in the continued planning and implementation of the National Plan. We will continue to promote the involvement of our members in this important effort and stand ready to recommend psychologists (including researchers, clinicians, and educators) with expertise in a wide array of areas that are critical to the plan's success. These areas include: cognitive aging; neuropsychological and capacity assessment; evidence-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers; implementation research, public education and social marketing; palliative care; designing culturally appropriate programs and materials; health provider education and training; integrated health and care coordination models; and dementia guideline development.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments, or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of APA's Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>American Psychological Association Comments on Draft National Plan</strong></p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) appreciates that the Draft National Plan is responsive to some of the concerns that we raised in January. In particular, we are pleased to see greater attention to clinical trials to test lifestyle interventions, including exercise and cognitive training. These interventions show promise as ways to improve cognitive health, and may in time be shown to prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The second draft's emphasis on recruiting diverse participants to clinical trials is also important.</p>
<p>The ability to image biomarkers has significantly advanced the study of Alzheimer's. What continues to be missing in the current draft is an acknowledgement of the critical role of neuropsychological testing and assessment to measure changes in cognitive performance. Real clinical benefits for those with AD depend on fully understanding how biomarkers relate to cognition and behavior. It is fundamentally important to understand why people with similar amounts of beta amyloid may have very different cognitive profiles. The National Institute on Aging and its funding partners are urged to support additional research that links the presence of biomarkers with changes in cognition and functional behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1A: Identify research priorities and milestones </em></p>
<p>APA supports the convening of a summit to help set research priorities to reach the goals articulated in the National Plan, and the additional strategies to receive broad input and refine and update research goals and priorities as the Plan is put into effect. APA also supports the convening of a workshop on non-Alzheimer's dementias, and offers assistance for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>In order to clarify the types of research being discussed, APA suggests the following wording changes - with underlined text to be added and struck-through text to be deleted: </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will expand clinical trials on pharmacologic and <s>non-pharmacologic</s> <u>behavioral</u> ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: APA prefers that behavioral studies be given their own name, and that they not be defined only by whether they include a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>"Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular, cellular, <u>and cognitive</u> mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention. "</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Certainly molecular and cellular work is vitally important. However, an 'integrated interdisciplinary basic science agenda' for Alzheimer's must also include basic cognitive and behavioral research.</p>
<p><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Identifying <u>and linking</u> <s>imaging</s> biomarkers <u>and behavioral/cognitive markers</u> in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Biomarker research is tremendously important, but it is neuropsychological and cognitive measures that enable scientists to link biomarkers to observable clinical symptoms. Biomarker research advances are leading to the ability to diagnose and track AD, but findings cannot be considered complete in the absence of behavioral data. Therefore, the two areas of research should be linked in the plan's language.</p>
<p>Current research demonstrates that neuropsychological measures function well as diagnostic, prognostic, and disease progression indicators (Blacker et al., 2007; Gomar et al., 2011; Jacobs et al., 1995; Tabert et al., 2006). Cognitive measures are critical in the practical and operational (not theoretical) level within all three recognized stages of AD -- pre-clinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia -- in recently updated diagnostic guidelines by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association. Therefore, cognitive measures hold the promise of identifying people at the highest risk of developing AD up to 20 years or more before the disease is diagnosed, and are the best measures of potential impact of interventions on disease progression. Particularly as treatments are worked into preclinical phases of AD, improvements in the sensitivity of the cognitive measures to reliable change over time is critically important.</p>
<p>Recent studies in 2010 and 2011, many using ADNI data, have shown that neuropsychological measures are more accurate, earlier predictors of progression to AD when compared to MRI, FDG-PET, and amyloid imaging (Gomar et al., 2011). There is considerable promise in broadening and improving the measurement of cognitive markers of AD. Every piece of the expansion and improvement of AD research will require good (and better) cognitive assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </em></p>
<p>"The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease includes healthcare and long-term services and supports providers such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, <u>neuropsychologists</u>, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants, who provide care at home or in long-term care facilities. These providers need accurate information about caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease including the benefits of early diagnosis and how to assist caregivers. Physicians need information on how to implement the "detection of any cognitive impairment" requirement in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit included in the Affordable Care Act. Major efforts by both VA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act, support geriatric training for physicians, nurses, <s>and other health workers."</s> <u>social workers, psychologists, dentists, pharmacists, counselors, and allied health professionals</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: We believe it is important as this plan will direct future efforts and funding in this area, that all geriatric disciplines be explicitly mentioned. Psychologists, social workers, and other health care providers play an integral role in VA interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Accordingly, they are included in the ACA expanded training provisions, and are listed on the BHPR website.</p>
<p><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools </em></p>
<p>"The Affordable Care Act created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. 'Detection of any cognitive impairment' must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment and risk for dementia," <u>and to determine the need for referral for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Neuropsychological evaluation remains a critical component of differential diagnostic methods in discriminating neurodegenerative changes from normal age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are related to psychiatric conditions or medical morbidities, and other related disorders. Neuropsychological measures are accurate, early predictors of progression to AD and provide useful information to individuals with dementia and their families regarding the functional capacities of the individual and potential impact of interventions on disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>"Most of the public is aware of Alzheimer's disease; more than 85 percent of people surveyed can identify the disease and its symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is also one of the most-feared health conditions. Yet there are widespread and significant public misperceptions about the <u>prevention</u>, diagnosis, <u>disease management</u>, and treatment." <u>In addition, there is a lack of public understanding of the differences between normal age-related cognitive change and pathological change</u>.</p>
<p><u>These misperceptions can lead both to delayed diagnosis when family members falsely attribute behavioral and memory issues to normal aging and to faulty diagnosis and harmful avoidance behaviors when families become paralyzed with concern about the stigma and decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. Both misconceptions can prevent families from obtaining needed and appropriate supports. They can also lead to inaction in adopting health promoting behaviors such as physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and refraining from smoking, which may prevent or slow any disease process</u>. "Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal because it forms the basis for advancing the subsequent goals of the National Plan. A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease will help engage stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by people with the disease and their families."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Two top tier messages of this campaign should be: 1) AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging; and 2) there are modifiable risk factors for AD (including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity) AND actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. A recent study (Barnes et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>4.A: Educate the public about <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Greater public awareness of <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease can <u>encourage individuals and</u> families to <u>participate in cognitive health promoting behaviors and</u> seek assessment, reduce isolation and misunderstanding felt by caregivers, and help link people in need to accurate information, resources and services," <u>when needed</u>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Professor, Researcher and Author comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over three decades I have worked as an educator at the University level, and therapist with individuals who have either been just diagnosed with early on-set of Alzheimer's Disease, mild- to moderate stages of the disease as well as late stage Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I have taught at Colleges and Universities across the United States as well as in many countries internationally. Being a two time Fulbright Scholar in Global Health Studies, I have dedicated my academic career to both teaching, researching and authoring creative and innovative approaches on how to best provide programming to those afflicted with this disease. I welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>In recent years, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as creative arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement programming; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, and cognitive training are recognized in small scale studies and are the basis of research information taught and practiced at the University level in career areas such as Therapeutic Recreation, Creative Arts Therapies, Movement and Dance Therapy and Art Therapy. These non-pharmacological approaches have emerged as a grassroots movement responding to an evolution of evidence, put into research and implemented in Social Adult Day Programs, Assisted living Facilities, and Long Term Nursing Facilities.</p>
<p>However small these studies, research is continuing to suggest that some individuals will slow the progression of dementia and have the potential to improve or revert back to normal memory with early interventions due to structured cognitive stimulation (Pressley, J., Trott, C. &amp; Tang, M., 2003; Chertkow, H., et al., 2001). Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that activities in the mental, physical and social domains have protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia (Flatiglioni, et al. 2004; Gilley, W., Wilson, L., Bienias, L., Bennett, A. &amp; Evans, A., 2004; Claire, L., Wilson, B., Carter, G., Roth, I. &amp; Hodges, J.,2004; Davie, J., et al., 2004). More specifically, continued active participation in life through social involvements and activities that are individualized and person centered to each individuals needs and skills have been documented to enhance feelings of self esteem, self worth and directly impact overall quality of life (Pruessner, J., Lord, C., Meaney, M. &amp; Lupien, S., 2004; Manly, J., et al., 2005; Kumara, R., et al., 2005). A National study of all research related to early stage dementia indicated that the need for psychosocial support for persons newly diagnosed should take place soon after receiving the diagnosis to prevent dropping social support networks, cognitive decline and leading to increased institutionalization rates (Brodaty, H., Gresham, M., &amp; Luscombe, G., 1997; Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2003). In a review of the literature regarding early stage AD it has been documented that multi-modal approaches have the most significant outcomes (Burgener, S., et al., 2007). The TTAP Method, a multi-modal approach has been documented in a pilot study (Alders, A. &amp; Levine Madori, L., 2010) to improve cognition in Hispanic elderly in a Social Adult Community Day Center in Buffalo, New York and in a research study with Rehabilitation Patients at Helen Hayes Hospital the method proved to increase overall feelings of self control and pain management (Levine-Madori, L., 2009).</p>
<p>Research in the area of non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care is still being ignored, and yet it continues to remain the most economically sound approach. In a data collection in 2010 on a Gero- psychiatric unit at Lyndon Oaks at Edward Hospital located in Naperville, Illinois, staff was trained in The TTAP Method. Pre- training data collection documented the unit had an average of 90 hours of aggressive interventions a month. These interventions were carried out by a Nursing Supervisor. Six months into staff implementing of thematic person-centered creative arts programming the aggressive behaviors went down to an average of 4.6 Nursing Interventions. Falls went from an average of 5 per month to 3, this statistics validate a direct healthcare savings of over $80,000.00 in just a six moth period. <a href="http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php">http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php</a> .</p>
<p>A world without Alzheimer's, might very well be a real possibility in the future. However, the current 5.4 million people who currently have the disease and the estimated 10,000 people daily diagnosed each and every day will still need daily non-pharmaceutical innovative programming, treatment and care. As an Art Therapist, Recreation Therapist and Ph.D. it is my belief that the current research agenda is narrow in scope and leaves research in the non-pharmaceutical -creative arts completely out of the discussion. For decades we as a society have poured millions of dollars into pharmaceutical research, which to date has yet to make an impact. It is my belief that it is crucial at this point in time, just as the baby boomers are starting dramatically impact the "graying of America". As you probably are aware, it is estimated by the National Association on Alzheimer 's disease, in 2011, that one of every 8 baby-boomers are predicted to have some form of cognitive impairment in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The time for researching the non-pharmaceutical approaches and putting research into practice is now! Those who have dedicated their lives to people afflicted by this disease process understand that these individuals LIVE with the disease for many years. The average person diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease now lives 15 years and must be given meaningful and person-centered daily therapeutic interventions. Without research we cannot move forward in the healthcare areas such as Art Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Music Therapy, etc. to provide research based, best practice approaches. Please know that these healthcare fields in the Creative Art Therapies, Therapeutic Recreation, and Music Therapy are in fact where daily treatment and ongoing cognitive, social, emotional and physical stimulation comes from. Research money is needed to be earmarked for these healthcare professionals and the research that they do in non- pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share thoughts and suggestions with you.</p>

<p>The American Health Care Association (AHCA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease published in <em>Federal Register</em> Volume 77, Number 37, pages 11116 - 11117 (February 24, 2012).</p>
<p>AHCA represents nearly 11,000 non-profit and proprietary facilities dedicated to continuous improvement in the delivery of professional and compassionate care provided daily by millions of caring employees to 1.5 million of our nation's frail, elderly and disabled citizens who live in long term and post-acute care facilities. We are most interested in this plan since we care for many people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. According to the <strong>AHCA Nursing Facility Patient Characteristics Report, March 2012</strong>, almost 48% of all nursing facility residents across the U.S. are identified as having some form of dementia, while the <strong>March 2012 AHCA Nursing Facility Operational Characteristics Report</strong> indicates that 71% of all special care beds in nursing facilities today are dedicated to care for persons with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>AHCA supports the national plan's guiding principles, goals, strategies and actions and believes the plan is timely, and when executed, will produce a better understanding of the disease and the prevention strategies, care and resources that will be required to care for people living with dementia. Since we are in agreement with the national plan and find it to be comprehensive, we offer only a few comments for your consideration.</p>
<p>The plan identifies that it is often difficult to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in terms of clinical presentation and diagnosis. AHCA would like to see this statement expanded to also include the importance of distinguishing undiagnosed psychiatric disease and characteristics, like behavioral symptoms, from Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI), the nation's largest mental health organization formed in 1979, the nation's mental health system has been and continues to be in crisis. NAMI grades states in their provision of mental illness (MI) services and rates the nation as a "D" (an average of all the states). Services found lacking include the number of psychiatrists, treatment services, and community-based supports -<a href="http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009">http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, David Grabowski, PhD from Harvard Medical School looked at MI and Dementia in nursing homes. Grabowski found that between 1960 and 1970, states closed and downsized psychiatric hospitals. As a result, many states were ill equipped to provide community service alternatives and nursing homes became the "de facto" treatment destination for people with MI. Grabowski cites findings indicating that in 2005, 12% of persons newly admitted to nursing homes had dementia, 19% had MI and 6% had both MI and dementia and the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) process, instituted in nursing homes with OBRA in 1987, was not effective at ensuring appropriate placement and treatment of persons with MI - <a href="http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf">http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The NAMI and Grabowski findings are concerning in that nursing home providers often admit individuals with undiagnosed MIs due to the lack of state MI services. These individuals may present with behavior problems that are often mischaracterized as symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and in some cases, represent both dementia and MI and raise important care issues that need to be addressed. Considering this, AHCA recommends that the national Alzheimer's plan, particularly Goal 1, Strategy 1.A related to research priorities, address the prevalence of undiagnosed MI in nursing homes, ways to distinguish undiagnosed MI from Alzheimer's, and best practices for treating individuals living with both dementia and MI.</p>
<p>Finally, the national plan identifies the need to monitor the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes (Goal 2, Strategy 3.D). AHCA is in agreement with the strategy's focus. One of our four priority goals as part of our Quality Initiative is for our members to safely decrease the off-label use of antipsychotics by 15% by the end of 2012. Given that many individuals admitted to nursing facilities are already on these drugs, reduction in off-label use of antipsychotics in nursing facilities will be more successful if attention is also given to reducing off-label prescribing in the hospital and in the community. It is important for all settings of care that provide services to the elderly to monitor and report their rates of off-label use of antipsychotic drugs. Expanding the scope of monitoring will help to more consistently and effectively detect and eliminate inappropriate uses of these drugs and help reduce antipsychotic drug prevalence in nursing facilities. AHCA recommends that the national plan, Action 3.D.2, be expanded to all healthcare settings.</p>
<p>AHCA welcomes the opportunity to work with HHS on future discussions and planning related to addressing Alzheimer's disease and on any further development and refinement of strategies and actions to improve and monitor care. We thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments.</p>

<p>The Iowa Department on Aging is encouraged by the initiation of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. A diagnosis of, or in many cases just a discussion about Alzheimer's disease or related dementia can trigger a sense of fear, foreboding and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's plan has the potential to greatly improve and enhance the current system and help improve the quality of life and quality of care for both people diagnosed and their caregivers. But without adequate funding attached to the proposed goals, we are concerned that systems change is not possible.</p>
<ol><li>To effectively create a system to enhance quality care and efficiency we believe the Plan should dictate minimum standards including, but not limited to the following:
<ul><li>An increased number of hours of education and training required for health care professionals and other disciplines who come in contact with people diagnosed with dementia.</li>
<li>Physician training programs that stress the importance of early detection and diagnosis.</li>
<li>Create and implement dementia unit requirements that include specially trained activity personnel, increased daily programming and adequate social work staff to meet the needs of people living in long-term care facilities.</li>
<li>Dementia care offered in hospitals must include staff with dementia training and enough staff to properly care for patients with a dementia diagnosis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expand patient and family support by enhancing existing systems.
<ul><li>Strengthen the National Family Caregiver Program to ensure that specialists are dementia capable and can provide education, referral and resource information and support to family caregivers who are caring for a person with dementia.</li>
<li>Strengthen the Lifespan Respite Program by providing adequate funds for respite care for people with dementia. Statistics show that access to respite care has a definite impact on the length of time a person can be cared for at home.</li>
<li>Provide access to evidence based programs that demonstrate effective support to all caregivers of people experiencing dementia</li>
<li>Increase psychosocial interventions for the caregiver and care receiver that offer support and assistance for people in home and community based programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enhance public awareness and engagement through an organized, funded campaign to assist the general public in:
<ul><li>Understanding the importance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment.</li>
<li>Understanding the importance of future planning</li>
<li>Becoming knowledgeable about long term living and community support services that are available in local communities
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>The Iowa Department on Aging believes that a nationally funded and coordinated effort is needed to enhance care, expand caregiver support and increase awareness and we support the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>As younger populations become increasingly urban and concentrated, persons more likely to have Alzheimer's or related dementia, become stranded in rural communities without adequate resources or family to assist them as the disease progresses. As jobs become scarce in rural communities, children of the baby boomers have moved where there are better job prospects leaving their parents alone. The community supports simply are not adequate in rural communities to address the specific needs of persons with dementia who have no informal primary caregiver's. Many of these people will end up in nursing facilities, that are ill-equipped to handle the specific care needs of an Alzheimer's patient. Nursing homes are for skilled care; however, Alzheimer's patients frequently do not need skilled care (for much of the disease progression), they simply need supervision, social stimulation, and help with minimal ADL's and IADL's. Nursing facilities have problems handling the behavior of Alzheimer's patients, because they are frequently mobile and cause disturbances with other patients. As a result nursing facilities are reluctant to accept patients with Alzheimer's disease early in disease progression. <strong>The addition of Alzheimer's dementia specific units to nursing facilities, especially in rural communities, would alleviate some of this problem. The staffing would be smaller, and the cost per day to medicare/Medicaid could be reduced as a result.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, for informal caregivers that do live in rural communities, support groups, educational opportunities, and training are absent. In addition, broadband internet is also difficult to obtain do inadequate infrastructure, leaving the caregiver unable to obtain information. The stress of caregiving combined with isolation shortens the amount of time an informal caregiver can increase the chance the persons are placed in nursing facilities for lack of another option. <strong>Providing community training through religious institutions, civic organizations, and other groups would allow for wide dispersal of accurate information, as well as the infrastructure in rural communities, improving early diagnosis and extending the amount of time a person can stay at home with a caregiver by reducing their stress through knowledge and resources.</strong> One way of accomplishing this is to certify persons at the AAAs or County Health Departments to recruit and train volunteers to provide outreach and educational events in their communities.</p>
<p>Another component of stress reduction is respite support. Caregiver's of persons with Alzheimer's or related diseases care for their loved ones for long periods of time. The time spent away from work, church, and family can become taxing and frequent breaks are needed. As there is increased demand for respite, and in the absence of increased funding for flexible respite support one of two options is available: 1) reduce the amount of respite per caregiver or 2) maintain lengthy waiting lists. Both options fail. At some point, respite is ineffective if it is infrequent and for very brief periods of time. If the caregiver waits too long without a break on a waiting list for respite, the caregiver will give up before the programs can provide assistance. <strong>The solution is to increase funding for respite supports through the AAAs, V.A., as well as introduce a income needs based component to respite support programs eligibility requirements.</strong> People that are wealthy ought to pay for their respite, or prove they have paid x amount before they can gain access to subsidized respite support each year. The reach of the programs would extend to those least likely to take a break, because they are unable to afford it.</p>

<p><em>This letter is very similar to my oral testimony (a few corrected typos and better words)--except for my adding a new paragraph at the beginning--to respond more fully to a public comment that preceded mine:</em></p>
<p>A person (Michael Ellenbogen?) who currently suffers from mild Alzheimer's dementia concluded his comments by recommending the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services consider the "right-to-die" option. He thus implied that Physician-Assisted Dying could be an option for patients who suffer from dementia. Because of time limitations, I could only disagree briefly by saying that Physician-Assisted Dying will neither help nor is needed. I now explain more: (1) Why would Physician-Assisted Dying NOT help? Where Physician-Assisted Dying is legal, the law requires patients be of "sound mind" when they ask their physician to write a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Yet dementia patients lose the mental capacity to make medical decisions early in the course of this progressive disease. Thus for dementia patients, Physician-Assisted Dying would compound their tragedy with <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong>. This is because dementia patients can have much good life after they lose capacity--and they can expect more, with further research--so I and many others consider <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong> an act that violates the <strong><em>principle that life is precious</em></strong>. (2) Why is Physician-Assisted Dying NOT needed? Because Living Will forms and the discussions they provoke can be both moral and effective. Combined with other clinical and strategic forms, diligent Advance Care Planning can give people peace of mind, whether they are still well or in the early stage of dementia. They need not worry about being forced to linger for months to years by enduring the huge burdens and suffering that characterize Advanced Dementia. Instead, they can feel confident that others <strong><em>will honor their Known Wishes</em></strong> after they lose the ability to speak for themselves.</p>
<p><em>Here is my original comment:</em></p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is most urgent, <strong>most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend that their patients/clients complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most urgent</strong>? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The reality of the huge, increasing epidemic of patients whose lives will end as they suffer from Alzheimer's disease makes Advance Care Planning even more urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most important</strong>? Because patients can linger in the terminal stage of Alzheimer's Dementia for several years. The relentless course of their disease may frustrate the best efforts of their clinicians, their caregivers and their loved ones. The multiple burdens on others are well known. For example, more than one-third of Alzheimer's caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many who have lost the ability to complain and whose behavior may be atypical, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most challenging</strong>? Unlike other terminal illnesses, often there are no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." They may believe: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. Then, I'll be trapped in a condition I loathe so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only compound the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients effective advance care planning so they can feel confident they can choose to avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then, many will ironically choose to live as long and as well as possible--and benefit from improvements in the medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning for Advanced Dementia needs research funding to develop and to implement--even if other researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. We know that changes in the brains of dementia patients begin one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. We also know it takes many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and to adopt a policy to implement widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers predicted to get dementia are still likely to become demented. Even if a new drug were available today, patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia. Most importantly, when they do reach the advanced stage of dementia, these patients will then have only their Advance Directives on which they can rely, to control <em>how long, and how much, they must suffer</em>before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we must thus fund research programs that will: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend their clients and patients have the discussions and complete the forms...now, while they still can.</p>

<p>My father is the third person I know to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. First was my uncle who passed away in 2005 and then my aunt or father's sister who, although 6 years younger has had it for over two years now.</p>
<p>The impact of this illness on the family is devastating. There is no one place to go for help or all the information you need. It takes a village to handle an aggressive, geriatric Alzheimer's family member. As a caregiver one needs to find out as much as possible as quickly as possible to get the help needed for a loved one. Nobody tells you all the challenges you will have and the financial impact it has on the family as well.</p>
<p>My father was normally an intelligent man, very good with mathematics, science and spoke English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Now we see him unable to handle his finances, becoming increasingly aggressive, suffering from delusions and hallucinations regarding our mother who he has been married to for 62 years.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that a mental healthcare power of attorney was not signed since the lawyers don't mention that when you go to get your will and other papers in order, we had to apply for emergency guardianship to get my father admitted to a level one psychiatric facility. After he is there for three weeks and thoroughly evaluated we are told he cannot come home due to delusions regarding our mother. Now we have to find someplace for him and try to find resources to help us. Unfortunately we end up putting him in a group home which we think is the right thing since it is similar to his home and the advice we get from social workers as well as companies such as Care Patrol, that have familiarity with this illness. Since we have no experience we follow the guidance of these "professionals." Unfortunately in our case perhaps also due to the stressfulness of the situation we did not make the right decision. The home was nice but the caregiver, although a nurse, was not there most of the time, and the other caregivers were Pilipino and did not understand English very well.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse when my brother goes to visit my father and he is in bed at 7:30 since the caregivers don't seem to want to be bothered with the patients. When he arrives my father gets up from bed and falls and the door is locked and the caregivers can't seem to figure out how to get the door opened. My brother finally does and dad is on the floor. The caregivers just leave the area and my brother and his son help my father get back into the bed. My father seems to be in a drug stupor and his eyes roll back in his head. I get a frantic call from my brother and call the hospice since he was on palliative care and ask them to send a nurse immediately since the nurse who owns the group home is not there. I also leave an urgent message for her, which is never returned. I wait and then call for the nurse at the hospice that is on call to find out that she was denied entry into the home by the caregivers who told her he was sleeping and to come back the next day. When I confront the owner of the home the following morning she insists that she called me even though there is no record on my answering machine or caller id on the home or cell phones. Then she also indicates that her mother told her that nobody came to the door from the hospice, which was an outright lie. I immediately started looking for another facility but it was difficult since they are all extremely expensive and my mother is alive and living with physical disabilities at home and all of my father's social security, pension and VA benefits (which I applied for since he was a WWII veteran) have to go in their entirety to his care and we still fall short.</p>
<p>During the time I looked for a facility I asked the group home owner not to transport my father anywhere since there was an issue when we brought him home for lunch prior to that. I had met him at a follow-up appointment with his neurologist and she said we could try to bring him home to see how it went. The first time we tried it he seemed ok but it was after an appointment for a vision test and he refused to get in the car unless we took him home. On that occasion, he managed to get his checkbook which we later found out about since we could not locate it to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The following week he had a dentist appointment due to periodontal disease which we needed to attend to. After that appointment , when we brought him home, he became very agitated and pulled a knife out of a drawer, which usually had only papers(so we can only imagine he had placed it there the week before, since we did not). He sat down and said he was not going back to the group home or as he called it, a jail. Then he said he would kill my husband if he ever saw him again since he was the one who, with my sister, brought him to the hospital. I asked him to return the knife and he took it and put it under some papers behind him. This wasn't a small knife it was a large carving knife. I asked for it back but he refused and then went out back and started cutting plants with it and ended up coming in the house without it. He had hidden it. I sent my sister out to retrieve it and she found it in a bucket outside. I took that knife and the rest that were in the house and put them in the trunk of my car. While I did that he went in the back yard and left from the gate on the side and was halfway down the block on foot. I ran to catch up with him and my sister called the police since we were very concerned and needed to get him back to the group home. When the police came he told them he would go back with us and when they left and we were a few blocks away he lunged over the back seat and grabbed my steering wheel and tried ripping the keys out of my ignition and then grabbed the gear shifter to get the car out of gear. I immediately jammed on the breaks and told my sister, who was sitting next to me, to call 911 and that is when he tried to grab the phone from her. I told him I would go back to the house and proceeded slowly to give the policemen a chance to get there. I went past the house and he became agitated and tried getting out of the car but could not since the child locks were on the doors. Unfortunately I forgot the window locks and he was able to open the window and got his body out up to his hips. I had to stop the car and get his feet back in. This is 5'8" man who weighs 158 lbs. I am only 5'3" and weigh 130. This time four police cars came and the officer ended up having to put my father in his squad car and take him back to the home.</p>
<p>Despite the incident that happened and the fact that the group home owner knew about what happened and was told not to take him out, her husband took my father to the bank a couple of weeks later and the bank rep called my mother and then me since my father was requesting his social security number to take out money.</p>
<p>When I finally found a decent place for my father that specializes in Alzheimer's and dementia care, the group home was very rude and unprofessional with the nurse who came to assess him and asked them in front of my father if they were going to take him to a psychiatric facility. So in addition to all the stress now we had to deal with a group home that was manipulating him so he would not leave. He was also writing them checks, which I got back, but we closed the account to keep anyone from taking advantage of him. He had promised money to them, wrote checks to his attorney who was appointed by the court and was promising thousands to the staff and doctors in the hospital where he was assessed.</p>
<p>On top of everything we ended up getting calls from Elder abuse since the owner of the home was apparently upset that we were taking him out and kept arguing that he wasn't ill despite the medical records from a neurologist and psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Our family has been going through hell. On top of all this there was a tremendous amount of paperwork to get VA benefits, get medications and other medical issues taken care of and the legal expenses for guardianship are bleeding my parent's dry. The emotional impact on our mother and the rest of us has been awful as well.</p>
<p>I tell you all this so you can see what it is like since none of us ever imagined how awful this would be. I don't think anyone knows what it is like until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Waiting until 2025 is too late. In my visits to many facilities I have seen people in their 40's and 50's with the disease and it will only get worse as the baby boomers age. With twice as many of them as their parent's generation we are in for a healthcare meltdown if something isn't put in place soon. We need to do something now. I am sure we are not the only family going through this.</p>
<p>There should be more research into different modalities (allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, etc.) to address this illness. I have read that there are studies being done regarding a cancer medication that is on the market that reduces the amyloid plaque in the brain. This is the website: <a href="http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html">http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html</a>.</p>
<p>I have also read about a possible treatment or preventative in raw coconut oil by a doctor who used it on her spouse: <a href="http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf">http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf</a>. Perhaps the cure or prevention lies in a combination of different modalities and all should be considered.</p>
<p>Families need more financial assistance and better resources where they can find all or most of the information needed with respect to legal, medical and assisted living resources as well as support groups to help families get the assistance they need as quickly as possible. Most of what is out there now is just "you are on your own" looking though websites in the midst of a crisis trying to find the help and guidance you need or other families at support groups trying to help each other. When a family is in constant crisis they need as much assistance/guidance as quickly as possible to help them navigate the system of care so they can make the right decisions for their loved one.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the findings but it must also be noted that some co-occurring chronic conditions such as sleep apnea (<a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021">http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021</a>) hearing loss (<a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study</a>) and periodontal disease (<a href="http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html">http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html</a>)should also be included in annual geriatric screenings since they can be directly linked to causing dementia and may be overlooked. In addition something should be put in place regarding hearing loss and the prohibitive cost of hearing aids. Perhaps insurance companies can increase fees by a few dollars a month on their premiums to include some coverage for hearing aids. Everyone is impacted by hearing loss of a senior citizen: family, motorists who drive on the roads along with them, and anyone who the hearing impaired interact with. Since hearing loss can be linked to dementia making hearing aids more affordable through some sort of coverage could help in part, to address this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone directly related to the care of a patient with dementia or Alzheimer's and affiliated with a medical facility, assisted living, or group home should need to be certified to care for a patient with this illness and display that certification where it is visible to family who are looking for care for their family member. There are people who claim to know how to handle patient s with this illness, yet do not, and tend to take advantage of the family as well as the person with the illness.</p>
<p>There should be clear guidelines in place as to what the group homes can and cannot do such as taking a dementia patient to the bank to take out money. I bring this up since this happened with my father.</p>
<p>Medical assessments in the home would help greatly as well since it can be impossible to get a dementia patient to the doctor or hospital unless you have a mental health care power of attorney. If a patient is hospitalized and determined to have dementia, a mental health care power of attorney should automatically be granted without the family having to dish out thousands of dollars to an attorney when the person has received a neurological and psychological evaluation by qualified physicians. This would save the families of these patients thousands of dollars which can be used for their care. A regular health care power of attorney is insufficient since we were told that Alzheimer's and dementia are considered physical illnesses with psychological manifestations. Without a mental health care power of attorney the family has to file for emergency guardianship and then permanent guardianship which can cost upwards of $20,000. This is a progressive disease with no known cure at this point. It is ridiculous to penalize an already suffering family to have to deplete their savings when their loved one is only going to progress in mental deterioration and obviously needs a guardian. Many times they feel that they are not ill and will continue to fight and deplete their funds further until they end up on ACCHHS (Medicaid), which in turn just depletes the government's funds further. If this is a necessity perhaps some cost containment should be put in place so families aren't hurt financially by exorbitant legal fees.</p>
<p>Another issue is medication. The VA indicates it can help with the cost of medication but you have to bring the patient into their facility. Once they are in a memory care facility they are not always amenable to being transported so it would be of great help to have a VA rep come to the patient facility to assess them for the medication benefits or just to have the paperwork from the doctor diagnoses serve as proof that the person needs the medication and provide it and delivery at no cost to the veteran.</p>
<p>The facility that my father is currently in provides dental care via mobile dentistry. It would also be beneficial to have the same with respect to mobile hearing units to help many of the residents in these facilities to get the hearing assessments and hearing aid cleaning, hearing aids, wax removal, etc. to ensure that they can hear effectively. Mobile vision care would also be a plus to ensure that the patients are seeing well or are not developing illnesses of the eye.</p>
<p>Finally decent memory care facilities are very expensive (the one our father is now at costs $4,338/mo.) and that it would help greatly to have some sort of coverage to help as the only thing available is long term care insurance which many people do not have and once you are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is no longer an option.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these suggestions into consideration in your National Plan. After going through all of this first hand I can tell you that these changes are greatly needed and would help all the families out there who are going through all of these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>AAN Comments on Draft <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the American Academy of Neurology, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the highly comprehensive and needed <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> (Plan).</p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is the largest scientific and professional organization for neurology in the United States. Representing more than 25,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals, the AAN strives to promote the highest quality patient centered neurologic care. The AAN is proud to support the overall Plan and fully supports the vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease. The AAN is further pleased that a neurologist, Dr. Ron Petersen, was named as chairman of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>The AAN is committed to playing an active role in supporting the objectives of the Plan. Our feedback in the following areas is provided for your consideration as you refine the Plan framework:</p>
<ul><li>Neurologists' Role in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</li>
<li>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</li>
<li>Quality Measurement Considerations</li>
<li>Current AAN Dementia-related Resources</li>
<li>Submission to the CMI on Alzheimer's Care Delivery</li>
<li>Concluding Remarks</li>
</ul><p><strong>Neurologists' Role in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br />
					The science and practice of neurology are integral to efforts to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD), diagnose it, treat it, and slow its progression, as well as, provide support for patients suffering from the disease and their caregivers. Neurologists are specifically trained to manage AD and other chronic disorders of the brain and central nervous system.</p>
<p>Neurologists:</p>
<ul><li>Conduct basic and translational AD research</li>
<li>Provide a comprehensive assessment including clinical diagnostic evaluation and evaluation of cognitive deterioration over time</li>
<li>Make decisions regarding treatment for patients with AD " Engage in follow-up visits every three to six months for patients with AD</li>
<li>Provide patients and caregivers with decision aids, such as comprehensive end-of-life counseling and advance care planning</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of multidisciplinary teams, neurologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD. The role of the neurologist in the care continuum of AD is critical.</p>
<p>Many factors contribute to the current variations in care that patients with AD receive in the US. The AAN believes that improving care coordination among health care providers, strengthening education and support for AD caregivers, and increasing rates of early diagnosis would have a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.A.: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</strong><br />
					The AAN strongly supports increased investment in AD research. Current funding levels are vastly disproportionate to impact of the disease now, and will be greatly exacerbated as prevalence increases in the future as the US population ages if funding trends remain unaltered. In addition, there is a tremendous gap between the research budgets for AD and dementia (approximately $450 million) and the research budgets for other diseases like HIV/AIDs (approximately $3 billion). The AAN believes in the need to raise the profile of AD research to bring it in line with its present and expected impact to the country.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</strong><br />
					Expanded educational efforts are important in reducing care variations and preparing the health care work force for an aging population. However, the AAN would note further support for expanding the supply of well-trained specialists is critical as more complex diagnostic tests and AD therapies become available.</p>
<p>The AAN agrees that a sufficient workforce is necessary to have high quality health care. Though reimbursement issues are not directly addressed in the Plan, they undoubtedly shape care delivery. Spending needed time face-to-face with patients diagnosing and coordinating care for complex neurologic diseases such as AD is undervalued in the current fee-for-service payment model. A lack of proper payment threatens the future supply of individuals trained specifically in neurology, which is of particular concern since neurologists are key to a timely diagnosis.</p>
<p>There is a large role for case managers to handle some of the social aspects of AD care, including the provision of support or information about next steps to caregivers, so that physician can focus on medical issues.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Measurement Considerations</strong><br />
					Since there is still limited evidence and effective treatments for AD, it is intrinsically difficult to develop high standard quality measures. However, the AAN agrees that care quality should be measured to the extent possible, and has developed a quality measure set for dementia that was recently approved by the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI).</p>

<p><strong>Submission to the CMI on Alzheimer's Care Delivery</strong><br />
					The AAN met with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in early 2012 to discuss a suggested concept for modernizing the way care is delivered to patients with AD through a cooperative care team including neurologists, geriatricians/primary care physicians, geriatric psychologists, neuropsychologists, case managers, social workers, nurses, dietitians, and pharmacists. The concept goes on to address a major problem in the current delivery system for AD care: the misalignment of financial incentives that are causing monetary constraints to providing coordinated care.</p>
<p>View AAN's suggested concept here: <a href="http://www.aan.com/globals/axon/assets/9408.pdf">http://www.aan.com/globals/axon/assets/9408.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><br />
					Broad collaborations with private and non-profit entities should be encouraged and incentivized at the grassroots level to accomplish many of the goals outlined in the Plan, especially those involving caregiver support and quality of life interventions for patients. The AAN stands ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, and specialists), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and dissemination of its work. The AAN remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We appreciate your consideration of our comments.

<p>There are numerous improvements in the draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease from the initial framework plan. Additional areas of the plan still need strengthening and improvement. CCAL appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to help strengthen the draft plan. The comments follow.</p>
<p><strong>General </strong></p>
<ul><li>CCAL suggests that the plan include the words "other dementias" and be known as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias. The terms "Alzheimer's" and "dementia" are often used interchangeably. Many internists and family practice physicians (among others in the health care field), for example, are still not well educated about assessing and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and use the general term "dementia" to explain cognitive decline to patients and their families. The addition of the terminology "other dementia" is more inclusionary and desirable.</li>
<li>Person-centered care is the widely recognized gold standard of services and supports for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PWD) (Alzheimer's Association, 2006; Edvardsson, et al, 2010). It is a foundational aspect of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The draft plan is silent about person-centered care. CCAL suggests that the plan integrate the philosophy and orientation to person-centered care throughout the plan.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Challenges Section</strong> (page 4)</p>
<ul><li>Notably missing as a national challenge is the over prescription and utilization of antipsychotic medications as a first line of management for behavioral challenges experienced by PWDs. The medical community as well as the formal and informal caregiver communities need to be educated about non-pharmacologic approaches to such behavioral challenges as agitation. Medications should be used only if and when non-pharmacologic approaches have not been effective. There is currently a dearth of readily accessible information about recommended non-pharmacologic approaches and practices.</li>
<li>Also missing as a national challenge is recognition that the quality of programs and services for PWDs who reside in residential long-term care (assisted living, nursing homes) across the nation continues to be uneven and often less than optimal. There is no national focus on or effort to address quality for these long-term care programs and services despite the fact that the number of people living with dementia will increase over fifty percent by 2030.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Plan's Three Guiding Principles</strong> (page 5)</p>
<ul><li>CCAL applauds the second Guiding Principle that supports public-private partnerships. We recommend that the detail for this principle be expanded to specifically include dementia experts who represent the practice, policy, and research sectors. All too often senior executives are included on advisory panels solely because of their positions. Unfortunately they often lack actual dementia expertise and experience. It is vitally important that the national plan be developed, planned, and implemented by a diverse group of dementia experts who can provide "face validity" both to the plan and the process of its development and implementation.</li>

<p>The Developmental Disabilities Nurses Association supports the specific inclusion of persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) as requested by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG). In most cases, nurses assess individuals with IDD on a more frequent basis than primary health care providers, and thus may note signs and symptoms indicative of early stages of dementia in the settings in which individuals reside or spend their days. This increases the likelihood of prompt referral for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that this medically underserved population, some of whom by the very nature of their developmental disability are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, are considered by the NAPA council for inclusion in its proposal.</p>

<p>People diagnosed with dementia frequently have mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>In addition, their family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems.</p>
<p>There is a great need to recognize and treat these conditions, so that patients' cognitive functioning and quality of life is improved( or at least maintained).</p>
<p>Families of people with dementia have the regular challenges of us all; in addition family caregivers have the responsibility of caring for an adult whose behavior can be quite erratic. The unpredictability of their loved ones' behavior can lead to anxiety and depression.</p>

					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1,2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3,4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just ot have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><em>The Solution</em>: Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meeting these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiences come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stokeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</li>
<li><strong>FNIH Biomakers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</li>
<li><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment forAlzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</li>
<li><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</li>
</ul><p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>The California Mental Health Planning Council (CMHPC) is mandated by federal and state statute to advocate for children with serious emotional disturbances and adults and older adults with serious mental illness, to provide oversight and accountability for the public mental health system, to advise the Administration and the Legislature on priority issues, and to participate in statewide planning. With passage of the Mental Health Services Act, the Planning Council also has responsibilities related to workforce development.</p>
<p>One of the Systems of Care Committees that support the Planning Council is the Older Adult Committee (OAC). At our quarterly meeting that took place in San Diego, CA January 18-20, 2012, the OAC discussed the problems counties are experiencing in regard to providing older adults who have mental health diagnosis integrated care when they begin to display cognitive problems associated with the onset of dementia/Alzheimer's disease. We are concerned that as their cognitive abilities decline, their level of care will suffer. Full integration of care is what we feel they deserve. Older adults with mental illness dealing with yet another serious health issue deserve our support.</p>
<p>The OAC strongly believes that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must address the mental health needs of people with dementia/Alzheimer's disease. As the final plan is completed, we urge you to address the mental health needs of people with dementia/Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive issues as well as their caregivers who also deserve our attention. By recognizing and treating all these conditions we will improve the functioning of our patients as well as improving the quality of life for them and their caregivers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments I will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>

<td style="text-align:center"><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the only priority of the Plan; its other four goals are of very limited importance.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I do not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But expecting to achieve this by 2025 is wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>I suppose those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts regarding Alzheimer's and other dementias could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere. But this is at best a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly urge HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are the sections of the plan that should reflect behavioral health needs.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, but</p>
<ul><li>The clear priority is bio-medical research seeking pharmacological treatments. There is also a great need for research regarding non-pharmacological, psycho-social interventions, which hold great promise for improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers virtually immediately.</li>
<li>In addition, there is a great need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. It is true that these medications are over-used for people with dementia and can be dangerous. Fortunately, it is also true that non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers, also need information about how to detect co-occurring mental or substance use disorders and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. People with dementia and/or their family members are often served in these settings. And when people with AD in crisis, it is usually the mental health system that is turned to for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders-end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with psychiatric disabilities, who often develop dementia as they age, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia. They, as well as caregivers, can benefit from informational material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other formal care settings such as assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. It is also important to address the likely overuse of anti-psychotics for people with dementia who live in their own homes or with family caregivers.</p>
<p>In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia and should be used only after non-pharmacological interventions have been tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful, failing to mention assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, housing for people with developmental disabilities, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan also fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders make them too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>In addition, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that <strong>there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone</strong>. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>I hope that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what to include in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. Let me add that behavioral health services are not only important for those who are experiencing mental or substance use disorders. In addition, <strong>care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia could result in vastly improved quality of life for them</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better for people with dementia and their families, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking an ultimate solution when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>We, Drs. Matthew P. Janicki and Seth M. Keller, are the co-chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. On behalf of the National Task Group, we wish to make our thoughts and recommendations available to the Advisory Council with respect to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To complement the National Alzheimer's Plan Act process, the National Task Group was convened and produced a report titled, "<strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em></strong>", which was designed, in part, to develop and enhance community care options for aging adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The National Task Group also issued the "<strong><em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em></strong>" as part of this report. The National Task Group issued this Action Plan in January 2012 in the hopes that it would promote better understanding of how adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities age and how dementia, in particular, affects them.</p>
<p>We note that the issues we identified in the National Task Group's report, which was submitted to the Advisory Council at its January 17th meeting, has many parallels with those raised in the Draft Plan. Our report summarized and addressed some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Our report also noted that older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have special needs that at times require different actions than those provided for people in the general population. Alzheimer's disease affects everyone; but not everyone can be treated the same way when they are affected by this disease.</p>
<p>We have submitted these comments in order to clarify and provide feedback to the Advisory Council regarding its Draft Plan. First, we would like to note that the National Task Group is pleased that the Draft Plan contains mention of intellectual disabilities (in Strategy 2.H) as this group of Americans is composed of a significant number of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for Alzheimer's disease. We also would like the Draft Plan to contain at least mention of some general issues that we have raised in our Report and also have more elaboration on some key specific issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Given this, we'd like to offer the following comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Missing mention of the significance of Down syndrome in Alzheimer's research</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the text under Goal 1, neglects mention of the research with respect to the needs of people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certainly sustained research is warranted to better understand the etiology and course of dementia in this group of individuals. Additionally, notwithstanding the competing beliefs of whether research involving people with Down syndrome will benefit general research into the nature and cause of Alzheimer's disease, we feel that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will certainly benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down syndrome also demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. We would like to emphasize that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention that given the high risk of Alzheimer's disease among adults with Down syndrome, there is the continued need for focused basic and treatment research involving people with Down syndrome -- and this should be included under Goal 1. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>We note with satisfaction that the Advisory Council's Draft Plan recognized the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). However, we would like to recommend that mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities receive mention earlier in this section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. We would like to see the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Further, under the Strategies noted under Goal 2, it is important to propose that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only look into improvements of care for this specific population, but also, and perhaps more importantly, increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities earlier in the second section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</em></strong></p>
<p>Under Strategy 2.B, we would also like to recommend that mention be made of the challenges of carrying out effective screening and diagnoses for dementia among most individuals with intellectual disabilities due to their inherently varying abilities and cognitive functions. When nationally applicable instrumentation is developed or recommended it would be highly beneficial to make mention in the Draft Plan of the need for specialized screening instruments for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The National Task Group is currently undertaking the development of such an administrative screen, which would have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population. Recognition of this special need and work by the National Task Group would go far to gain acceptance of a regularized screen applicable to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We also would recommend -- adding text under Strategy 2.E -- that the notion that community care, as noted in the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, be the paramount means of long-term 'dementia capable' care delivery. We note specifically the growing evidence-based research that is supporting the inclusion of small group homes -- as a viable assisted living model -- and their role as a potentially powerful alternative care setting for people with dementia, and in particular those with lifelong disabilities. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with certain intellectual disabilities and that any national guidelines produced contain this consideration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also strongly recommend the consideration of the use of small group homes for the community 'dementia capable' care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia as backed by evidence-based research in the intellectual disabilities field.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>As many adults with intellectual disabilities and in particular those with Down syndrome remain in their family homes living with their parents or other family caregivers as they grow older, it is crucial that under Goal 3 inclusion of the challenges faced by these caregivers -- when providing care-at-home to their relatives with intellectual disabilities and dementia -- be given due mention. These 'life-long caregivers' warrant special attention in the Draft Plan as they are providing an important and crucial bulwark against costly institutionalization and oft-times inappropriate admissions to long-term care facilities. They are also often vexed by emerging symptoms of dementia in their adult children who have successfully mastered many general activities of daily living and now are manifesting decline. Special mention to the situations of these lifelong caregivers should be made in the Draft Plan. In this context, the National Task Group also recommends that Strategy 3.C.1. be amended to recognize that in many settings concerned with adults with intellectual disabilities, decisions are often made by proxy (and not by 'middle-aged adults') and that adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs. Thus, consideration should be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the enhanced public education resources related to intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Under Goal 4, we strongly recommend including the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities under public education campaigns and that the greater coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector should get mention. As the state developmental disabilities authorities (agencies) are instrumental in helping organize state functions and programs with respect to intellectual and developmental disabilities it would be extremely beneficial to include these entities (and state developmental disabilities planning councils) in any public education efforts at the state level. Also, education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. As there are health care disparities, an aggressive education campaign should involve universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists as it relates to cognitive and functional disability and its detrimental effect on caregivers and quality of life of the individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The National Task Group recognizes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. Given this, we are very pleased that the Advisory Council recognized the import of the special challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this group in Strategy 2.H. We would hope for those adults with intellectual disabilities currently affected by dementia and those in the next generation who may be affected (as the timeline for the NAPA process encompasses the next 13 years) that the Advisory Council will recognize other areas of inclusion of the specific issues affecting individuals with intellectual disabilities within the Draft Plan and accept our recommendations for additional areas of mention and focus.</p>
<p>We trust the our comments and recommendations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are provided -- as the collective concerns and thoughts of a significant body of professionals, scientists, administrators, family caregivers and advocates, and persons personally affected by dementia -- who are represented by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</p>

<p>As a Social Worker addressing the needs of seniors with mental health issues, I see how overwhelming the diagnosis of Dementia can be for patients and the people who care for them.</p>
<p>Many people are in denial over the diagnosis and its consequences, and who can blame them?</p>
<p>There is no cure at this time, and more and more support services have been limited.</p>
<p>Please provide for the mental health needs of patients and their families, as the following are increasingly evident:</p>
<p><em>Dementia frequently co-occurs with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems. </em></p>
<p><em>Recognizing and treating these conditions plays a vital role in improving patients' cognitive functioning as well as the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.</em></p>

<p>I am very heartened to learn that the federal government released a draft of a comprehensive plan to address Alzheimer's disease. I do want to voice my fervent hope that adequate attention is paid to the mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers in the government's plan.</p>
<p>I worked as a psychiatric social worker for 17 years on a locked inpatient hospital geriatric unit, where the predominant diagnoses were Alzheimers or Dementia with agitation, depression, delusions and/or hallucinations. I witnessed the range and severity of symptoms that caused elderly people with dementia to neglect themselves, to become violent, refuse help offered to them even by their own loving children, to become paranoid toward loving family members, and the devastating effects this had on families. Without access to mental health treatment provided by knowledgeable geriatric psychiatrists and other practitioners, these individuals suffering from dementia would remain in agony and distress, harmful to themselves and others.</p>
<p>I applaud our government for addressing Alzheimers disease and urge you to carefully consider the mental health needs of this population in planning for the future.</p>

<p>I have reviewed the scientific agenda for the National Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is another document of which I am unaware.</p>
<p>However if this is the gist of the national plan then I would submit with urgency that there are enormous gaps in the plan.</p>
<p>As a Geriatric Neurologist who specializes in diagnosing and managing patients with dementia and caring for their families I see no where in the plan for a mechanism to increase clinical providers.</p>
<p>There is a national urgency to recruit and keep clinicians who care for people with dementia.</p>
<p>Currently, I am one of very few providers in my town of nearly 1million people who will see patients with dementia. I have been told that I spend too much time with them, so I would have to pay the clinic to see these patients.</p>
<p>I WOULD HAVE TO PAY!</p>
<p>I have since spoken with many other providers who have told me that they cannot afford to see these patients.</p>
<p>The Neurology residents at our medical school no longer rotate through our dementia clinics, since they have no intention of taking these patients.</p>
<p>I am constantly asked by the public where to turn for dementia providers. I am at a loss. I have asked Alzheimer's Association representatives for recommendations and they just shake their heads and say they cannot find providers either.</p>
<p>If we are to take important research findings and bring them to the public, we desperately need the providers to be there to deliver this care.</p>
<p>This will require a major shift away from current payment plans that value procedures over time spent with patients.</p>
<p>Please do not neglect this critical area in your plan.</p>
<p>If I can be of further assistance in this, don't hesitate to let me know.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 49, after struggling to get a diagnoses from age 39. We need to better educate our doctors.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to read many of the public comments. Many referred Psychologists and Neuropsychologists that may not have been in the plan. While I think they can add a benefit to people with AD, they can also hinder diagnose, as was done to me. In my experience it delayed my diagnoses for about 10 years, not to mention the financial burden it created to our health system. Many need to be better educated on how people with AD react to the test they provide. They also need to put some merit in what their patients and caregivers may share with them. Especially if the caregiver is a RN.</p>
<p>In June 1999, I had my first full Neuropsychological Evaluation conducted by Dr. Lindsey Robinson. The summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills relatively evenly developed. Neuropsychological testing revealed moderate to severe impairments in information processing speed and sustained attention, with mild to moderate impairments in verbal learning efficiency. Short-term attention, expressive/receptive language skills, verbal and nonverbal abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were within normal limits for age. There was no evidence of clinically significant depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder which might account for the patient's cognitive deficits. The etiology of Mr. Ellenbogen's cognitive impairment is unclear as, from a neuropsychological perspective, his symptoms are nonspecific. However, the magnitude of impairment observed on objective testing, in the absence of identifiable affective disorder, does suggest the presence of some form of organic cerebral dysfunction. Further neurological evaluation recommended.</em></p>
<p>I another appointment with Dr. Lindsey Robinson on February 2001. It was frustrating dealing with these doctors because every time I had to see a new doctor or take a test, my primary doctor needed to okay it. The other frustration was that sometimes I had to wait 5 months for appointments, which was the case with this appointment. The test that I was about to retake was questionable. I was not sure my insurance would cover the procedure, so I had to jump through hoops with the doctor and my insurance company. If the test was not covered, it would cost me about $2,500.00. When you deal with these insurance companies, document the conversation for yourself and ask them to do the same. I cannot tell you how many times they tried to get out of paying, but then they checked their records and saw I had received pre-approval. They kept putting up roadblocks and I had to be in touch with them a lot, when I should have been working. It was bad enough that I had to leave work for appointments, I did not need the added aggravation from the insurance company.</p>
<p>I finally met with Dr. Lindsey Robinson. She had commented on my other doctors findings in the beginning of her report: <em>The etiology of his cognitive symptoms was felt to be multifactorial, including normal aging, alcohol consumption, and anxiety.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I saw those comments, I was very angry. She was making up her mind before even administering the test.</p>
<p>Her summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with no significant discrepancy between verbal cognitive skills and nonverbal reasoning abilities, There is no significant change in overall intellectual ability in comparison with the evaluation in June of 1999. On neuropsychological testing, Mr. Ellenbogen displays generalized psychomotor slowing and inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and memory. In comparison with the previous evaluation, a variable, inconsistent pattern of change was demonstrated, with improvements on some measures and declines on others. This pattern of performance is not suggestive of focal or lateralized organic cerebral dysfunction, and is not consistent with the presence of a progressive cognitive disorder. Rather, Mr. Ellenbogen's neuropsychological test performance suggestive of fluctuating levels of attention, concentration, and performance speed. Objective psychological screening suggest the presence of mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and an introspective, perfectionistic personality style. These psychological symptoms are most likely playing a significant role in Mr. Ellenbogen's subjective cognitive dysfunction.</em></p>
<p>She encouraged me to seek a psychiatric consultation to determine whether a trial of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication might be helpful in ameliorating my cognitive symptoms. She got me so aggravated, and she would not listen to anything my wife or I tried to tell her. She just did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>I went back to Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson, the Clinical Neuropsychologist, in January 2006. She was going to redo the neuropsychological testing. I thought it would be best to use this doctor again because she had a baseline for me and could compare my new results with the old. It would take months for the results. The other issue was that there were not many doctors, who performed this test, that were covered under my health insurance policy.</p>
<p>In June 2006, just a few weeks after my 48th birthday, Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson finally got back with the results of my testing. Her results for neuropsychological testing were as follows: <em>Background -- Previous neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001 revealed fluctuating, inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and performance speed, and symptoms consistent with anxiety and depression. Summary and recommendations -- Multiple aspects of Mr. Ellenbogen's behavior and test performance suggestive of inconsistent/incomplete effort during the evaluation. Thus, this test results described are not regarded as a valid representation of his optimal cognitive functioning. Mr. Ellenbogen's clinical presentation and test are unchanged in comparison with prior neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001. There is no evidence of progression of cognitive impairments, and Mr. Ellenbogen's developmental history and current test performance are not consistent with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any other organically-based cognitive disorder. Mr. Ellenbogen demonstrated an anxious/ obsessive personality style and some symptoms of depression. His cognitive can be most parsimoniously attributed to affective disorder and/or other motivational or psychological factors.</em></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Impression;</em></p>
<p><em>R/O Dementia (not in evidence)<br />
					R/O Anxiety Disorder, NOS<br />
					R/O Personality Disorder, NOS</em></p>
<p>Her recommendations -- <em>Mr. Ellenbogen should be reassured that thorough medical/neurological evaluation on multiple occasions has revealed no evidence of neurological cause for his cognitive symptoms. A trial of psychotropic medication could be considered to address Mr. Ellenbogen's apparent effective symptoms. He is unlikely to benefit from psychotherapy due to his reluctance to accept a non-medical explanation for his symptoms.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I met with her and read this report, I was so upset that I had made the decision to go back to her. First of all, during my testing we were not in a quiet area. Anytime I hear noise, it just throws me off. I have difficulty processing and concentrating when that occurs. There was nothing she could do to make it better. I tried very hard to be accurate during my testing and worked as quickly as I could. I tried to inform her that she was wrong in her findings, but she did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>She was so confident in her failure to diagnose me properly, that when I had reach out to her to make her aware that other Psychologists and Neuropsychologists determined that I did have Alzheimer's. She insisted on writing a letter to tell my primary doctor, that the others were wrong and she felt that her diagnosis was correct. Since that day I tried to reach out to her and gave her the opportunity to see the conclusions that 3 other doctors cane up with, but her office refused. Doctors like this will only hurt people like me. There should be a specific testing they must go through before they can test YOAD patients.</p>
<p>Maybe someone from your office can educate her. [address removed]</p>
<p>As you can see, it requires special doctors with the right training to deal with YOAD. I hope you will insure that happens.</p>

He has been diagnosed going int the advance stage; little language skills, completely dependent on me for his personal care and sleeps 15 hours a day. The only outside help (other than family) I get is two afternoons a week when the Santa Fe Senior Services provide Respite Care for three hours, which gives me a chance for free time. I felt very lonely until I took advantage of various Alzheimer's groups, caregivers, Alzheimer Cafe and discussion groups each meeting is only one day a month. There are no day care programs or affordable home care. I am 85 years old and have full 24+7 caretakers responsibility, I can not leave Al alone to go shopping. I have had to give up all my interest my involvement with my church and various activities.</p>
<p>I feel more attention should be directed towards caregivers and their needs and their family. My desire is to keep Al Home as long as possible but I need more help at home. I am 85 years old and I am concerned about how much longer I can keep up with all the demands of being a caregiver.</p>
<p>The caregiver is like the elephant in the room everyone knows it is there but they keep their blinders on. Caregivers need to be recognized and helped in every way possible.</p>

<p>As a Caregiver and Advocate for those affected by Alzheimer's Disease, I am Extremely pleased with the Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Given the fact that people are living longer, this Dreadful, Devastating disease is on the Fast track to becoming an Epidemic, which I am confident The National Plan will in deed keep in check and make much more manageable, so long as it is Fully Supported and Enforced.</p>
<p>Below, I wish to offer my input, which comes from Real Life Experience as a Caregiver and Advocate</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you will find this input most helpful.</p>
<p><strong>With Respect To Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<p>One of the Keys to Success in Keeping Alzheimer's Disease In Check Is Early, Timely Diagnosis.</p>
<p>I have found in my work as a Caregiver and Advocate that Alzheimer's enters the lives of those affected in ways we may classify as minor or may overlook such as; having to write things down more often, patterns of not being able to locate items or patterns of memory lapses, all of which we may joke off as ' Pre- Senior or Senior Moments '.</p>
<p>It is up to All Of Us to Keep An Eye On Each Other and Those Around Us, Should we see these behaviors, we Must Take Them Seriously and Track Them As Such.</p>
<p>Cognitive Testing / Evaluations Must Become Part Of Routine Exams For Everyone ,As We Never Know Where or When This Dreadful Disease May Strike.</p>
<p>With Respect To Testing / Evaluation, It Must Be More than asking a person their name, what day it is, what year it is and who the President is. I Propose we include questioning about work, family, driving skills, life skills, household management, personal care. In addition to Monitoring Personality / Behavioral Status and Changes.</p>
<p>The Key here is Proper Evaluation, Monitoring, Detection of Changes and Knowing When To Red Flag.</p>
<p><strong>Education / Training:</strong></p>
<p>Education and Training are Critically Important and Mandatory in the Diagnosis, Treatment and Care of Those Affected By Alzheimer's Disease, and Must Be An Ongoing Process As The Disease Evolves Over Time.</p>
<p>Through my Exposure and Experience I have seen the Blood Boiling Impact that Those With Poor / Little To No Knowledge, Education and Training can have when it comes to Alzheimer's, from Arguing with Patients , Poor / In-Effective Communication Skills to Leaving Patients Un-Attended. All of which are 100 Percent Un-Acceptable and In-Excusable.</p>
<p>People who are working in Any Capacity With Those Affected By Alzheimer's Must Be The Best Of The Best, The Cream Of The Crop as There Is No Room To Settle For Second Best.</p>
<p>Ill Willed or Under Qualified People Pose A Grave Danger and Threat To Those With Alzheimer's and We Must Ensure, The Best Of The Best Are Ready, Willing and Able To Step Up and Provide The Necessary Care.</p>
<p><strong>Caregivers and Support:</strong></p>
<p>Formal, Thorough, Ongoing Education, Training and Support Are Essential at All levels of the Caregiving Process, and It Must Be Seamless.</p>
<p>There Must Also Be Flexibility Within Medical Coverage Of All Types To Allow For Flexibility and Out of Network / Program Services If These Out Of Network / Program Services Provide A Level of Care / Support Which Standards and Quality Exceed In Network / Program. Why Should Those With Alzheimer's and Their Caregivers Be Backed Into A Corner Which Forces Acceptance Of Sub-Standard Services?</p>
<p>Caregivers at All levels also Need Adequate and Timely Relief To Prevent ' Burnout ' and To Tend To Their Own Personal Health and Affairs.</p>
<p>Caregivers Must Be Educated and Informed Of All Available Support Services, which as a Caregiver , Myself Can Be Overwhelming , In and Of Itself, As Most Are Unsure Of How To Begin The Process Of Locating Services or Lack the Time and Energy To Do So.</p>
<p>Given This, I wish to offer my services, as an official community resource, with respect to assisting Caregivers research, locate, apply for and coordinate support services. I have Professionally and Successfully Linked Caregivers with a myriad of support services ranging from In Home Personal Care Services to Financial and Prescription Support Services.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>In Closing, I Agree That Alzheimer's Is Quickly Approaching Epidemic Levels and If We Fail To Act Now, This Failure Will Prove To Be Devastating To Say The Least.</p>
<p>The National Plan, When Combined With Input, Such As Contained In This Document, Ensure That A Proactive Approach Will Lessen The Burden and Devastation Of Alzheimer's At All Levels.</p>
<p>We Must Also Unite and Advocate Tirelessly To Ensure Every Aspect Of This Plan Does Not Fall Prey To The " Politics ' Of Our Government ,As That Too Will Prove To Be Devastating.</p>
<p>Thank You For The Opportunity To Provide Input On The National Plan, It Has Been An Extreme Honor To Say The Least and I Look Forward To This Being Fully Enacted and Enforced.</p>

<p>This is a follow-up to my speech yesterday with an expanded version. I was concerned in keeping my 3 minute limit, which made me a bit nervous.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to thank you, the federal and non federal committee members, and all others involved, for what have already been accomplished, but we still have a long way to go. Money is going to be the biggest issue, even though the president recently committed more.</p>
<p>I am a 53 year old, living with Alzheimer's. I was diagnosed at age 49 after struggling for 10 years to get a diagnosis from age 39.</p>
<p>I have a few issues to address. The first one is related to 2025 date which was originally thought of, I have heard many on this committee and others with the dissatisfaction of that date. I strongly recommend that we show urgency and use the 2020date that everyone seems to support. I know it will take some courage on many of you to rethink this date but do it for all of us who have been waiting so long already. Just look back at the momentum and target dates they were trying to shot for HIV and Cancer. They were much more aggressive.</p>
<p>Second issues is the disparity around this disease. While I would like to see more funding dedicated to Alzheimer's, that may not always be possible. Today 18.7 percent of the NIH research budget goes to cancer, 9.9% to HIV, and just 1.4% to Alzheimer's. We need to be more fairly with the designation of those dollar amounts. There are many more people living with Alzheimer's than HIV, yet it receives much less funding. More funding is desperately for Alzheimer. They are all important causes and should be treated fairly. Keep in mind 98 percent of breast cancer patients continue to have a normal life when it its diagnosed early. Yet Alzheimer's patients do not have any chance what so ever. In fact 40% of their last years are so horrific that you would not wish it on your worst enemy, but all of our families have to endure it and become ill in the process..</p>
<p>And last, a subject that no one wants to talk about, but can save millions. The right to die with the help of a doctors. Many of us who have this disease do not want to ride it out to the end. We want to be remembered in a more positive view. We also do not want our families to suffer or have the added financial burden. Please consider the right to die for devastating diseases like this. While I do not like to talk about this, it is important to know how so many of us feel. I have had the opportunity to speak with other like me and they feel the same way. My biggest concern is that I may take my life much earlier than I need to or I may even screw up in the process and great a bigger medical condition because I did it to late and failed. That would not have been an issue a few years ago, when I had guns in the house. I gave the up for the concern for my own family. I did not want to wake up one day and think that they were intruders and shoot them. I would love to opportunity to let someone know what my wishes are based on a number of question answered so they know at what point and time they should acct on my wishes. It can be as simples as a score on the mini mental exam done at two different times. Please don't make me and my family suffer more than I need to. Have some passion. And of course this is based on being able to make these decision when one was still capable to make those decisions with a sound mind, which I still have.</p>
<p>I would also like to volunteer my services to be on your committees to represents others like myself who has this debilitating disease.</p>
<p>I would also like to see an open public input conference line, for all future meetings. I think it's very important for people like me to voice their opinions. What I did not like about the meeting is where many companies are trying to self advertise their special interest for their companies. There is a time for that and it should not take away from the people who are living with the pain. One example was the person representing GE and the petscan. We all know this is great product and all know it's needed, but they should have more brains then that.</p>
<p>Thanks again for hearing my shorten version yesterday and reading my extended version now.</p>

<p>My name is Joan Uronis. I am 62 and have recently been diagnosed with AD. Long before my diagnosis, I have been a passionate advocate for those with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Since I am no longer able to work, my new full-time career is one of advocacy. I have held executive positions in the healthcare field for over 15 years. My last position was as General Manager of a Hospice where I met with caregivers of persons with AD as well as those with the disease. For some reason I found myself devoted to this population. I also worked as Executive Director of an Assisted Living where I had contact with this special group as well.</p>
<p>My mother had Alzheimer's and died in 2010 at age 92 of the disease. I was her part-time caregiver. I have worked the disease and now am living it. I am a support group facilitator for the Alzheimer's Association and volunteer at an Assisted Living in their Alzheimer's/Dementia care center.</p>
<p>Having worked and experienced the lack of care for those of us with the disease, I am a voice for the voiceless, a voice for those ashamed to speak out and a voice for the issues and concerns that face all of us. Our main concern is one of adequate quality care. Alzheimer's patients require a unique type of care. My observations of the care that is provided to patients in Assisted Livings, Nursing Homes, Hospitals and by some physicians leaves my heart hurting. It leaves me with little hope of what may be in store for me.</p>
<p>My recommendations to give hope to those of us with the disease and to ease the minds of their caregivers are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Care given by state certified persons trained in working with those with AD. They need to be required to be recertified to continue to work with this population</li>
<li>Physicians trained in Alzheimer's as most have patients with the disease</li>
<li>All Medical students should to be trained in Alzheimer's and how to give the respect and dignity that we deserve. We are still human.</li>
<li>Nursing schools should also train nurses in the same regard. Being cold and hurried does not ease anxiety and frustration and leads to dehumanization</li>
<li>Hospitals need to be particularly aware of those with Alzheimer's and ensure their safety and check on them regularly</li>
<li>Emergency Room staff need to be aware of patients admitted with Alzheimer's. This was brought to light by my mother who was taken to the ER from her AL, she was in the late stage of the disease. When I arrived, she was at the edge of the bed with no one in attendance. Being confused I could only image what may have happened if I had not arrived.</li>
<li>A place where we can go that is specifically for us, not a part of another facility. This place would have staff that is certified in Alzheimer's care. The ratio of caregivers to patients would be small enough to ensure quality care. This would also ease the minds of caregivers.</li>
</ul><p>These same concerns have been expressed to me by caregivers who have found the same to be true. We all need to be treated with dignity, respect, concern for our safety and given the unique quality of care that we deserve. Alzheimer's care is unique and requires a much better understanding. On behalf of myself and those with the most dreaded disease, I thank you for listening. Our future is in your hands. God bless.</p>

<p>We have no additional comments; however we have identified a few points of interests:</p>
<p>Unless the disease can be effectively treated or prevented, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's disease will increase significantly in the next two decades. Therefore, HHS has included the following five foundational goals:</p>
<ol><li>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</li>
<li>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency</li>
<li>Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families</li>
<li>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</li>
<li>Track Progress and Drive Improvement</li>
</ol><p>Also, Goals 3 &amp;4 have the most implications to our AAA programs as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families</strong></p>
<p>Supporting people with Alzheimer's disease and their families and caregivers requires giving them the tools that they need, helping to plan for future needs, and ensuring that safety and dignity are maintained. To help respond to the challenges faced by families and other caregivers, the Obama Administration's Alzheimer's disease announcement makes a new investment of $10.5 million in fiscal year 2013 to support the needs of caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>There are widespread and significant public misperceptions about diagnosis and treatment that lead to delayed diagnosis and to people with the disease and their caregivers feeling isolated and stigmatized. Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal of this project.</p>

<p>Having just recently released the <em>Dementia State Plan: Virginia's Response to the Needs of Individuals with Dementia and their Caregivers</em>, the Virginia Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Commission (Commission) welcomes the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (Draft Plan)</em>. The emphasis on promoting research and developing new treatments that prevent and effectively treat the disease, expanding support for people with the disease and their families, and enhancing care quality and coordination are shared goals of both plans and we look forward to working together as state and federal partners in addressing the rapidly mounting Alzheimer's crisis.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 1</em>: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong>, the Commission promotes research, supports all strategies to facilitate dissemination of research findings into medical practice and public health programs, and would welcome federal funding for provider education and outreach. Under <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 2</em>: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, Virginia's own plan calls for coordinating quality dementia services, integrated systems of care, and development of dementia specific training. The Commission welcomes any federal support of this state plan strategy.</p>
<p>The action items in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 3</em>: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families</strong> mirror our own state plan recommendation, "In order to survive, families need dementia friendly solutions for their safety, services and behavioral concerns, including: assessment and diagnosis, counseling and support services, care management, respite care, assistive technologies and home modification, transportation, and payment options including long-term care insurance." Additionally, the Commission supports <em>Draft Plan</em> action items for legal services and stable housing for people with the disease. Because of Virginia's large military and veteran population, the Commission advocates for federal and state partnerships to meet the dementia care needs of this population.</p>
<p>As noted in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 4</em>: Educate the Public About Alzheimer's Disease</strong>, some states and localities "have published plans to address AD that coverage many of the same issues as the National Plan. Leveraging the available resources and programs across these levels of government will aid in the success of these efforts" to advance Alzheimer's Disease awareness and readiness across all levels of government. Finally, both Virginia's plan and the <em>Draft Plan</em> recognize the need to improve data collection to better understand the disease's impact on people with the disease, their families, and the healthcare system and, therefore, <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 5</em>: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong> is also imperative. Specifically, the Commission requests coordination of shared federal and state data and the removal of barriers to sharing of information and best practices.</p>
<p>The Commission looks forward to the final version of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> this spring as the Commonwealth is just beginning its state plan implementation. Concerted efforts in national and state strategic planning will provide the best chance to overcoming this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>Please accept the following comments on the draft National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders from the State Unit on Aging in Connecticut:</p>
<ol><li>While evidence based research can be a reliable tool, more flexibility should be granted to community providers and researchers to explore innovative and creative non-pharmacological approaches to living with and treating Alzheimer's disease. Our CONNECTIONS grant from AoA and our work in CT with NECC and cognitive training has afforded us with many examples of the positive impacts of this intervention on the quality of life for the caregiver as well as the individual with dementia. Excluding such projects from funding opportunities, further exploration or dismissing them as models because they do not have the full complement of expansive research behind them is short-sighted and limiting to families. Often the most innovative approaches are the ones that afford families a sense of empowerment in combating the disease process.</li>
<li>The strategy area of "maintaining the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's Disease" is critical. The perception of this disease and the assumed burden that families incur upon diagnosis often negatively impacts the delivery of care received by those with the diagnosis. Training medical and legal personnel as well as other individuals in the field is an excellent way to begin addressing the stigma associated with the disease and some of the misperceptions and assumptions that are prevalent. Monitoring and reporting the use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes is an excellent proposed action, as is providing awareness training and education for professional caregivers.</li>
<li>It would be beneficial to incorporate hospice options into any training module offered to families as well as facilities working with this population.</li>
<li>The design and implementation of a national education initiative is enthusiastically supported. We are still struggling with the same level of stigma 14 years after implementing our Statewide Respite Care Program (for individuals with Alzheimer's disease) in Connecticut, and many conversations with our local Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association underscore this sentiment.</li>
<li>I strongly encourage the Plan team to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment before new activities are initiated. Since many states and individual organizations may already be implementing aspects of the plan, best practices should be observed to obviate unnecessary and costly duplication or delays.</li>
</ol><p>Please contact me or Cynthia Grant our Alzheimer's contract specialist at the above email address should you need more information.</p>

<p>Cambridge Cognition offers the attached document for consideration.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Cambridge Cognition welcomes the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. In response to the request for comments relating to Strategy 2.b 'ensure timely and accurate diagnosis', and action 2.B.2, 'identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools', the Committee is invited to consider a computerized solution; and the following is submitted:</p>
<ul><li>In the context of an annual wellness check and also in the context of early diagnostic assessment, the careful choice of an appropriate cognitive test is imperative. Many cognitive instruments do not measure with adequate sensitivity the changes in episodic memory that are the characteristic feature of early in course Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.</li>
<li>Cognitive assessments should be sensitive to the changes that occur at the early stages of dementia, norm-referenced, culturally unbiased, easy-to-use and standardized in administration. One example of such a test is the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, a non-verbal, visuospatial measure of cued episodic memory.</li>
<li>Computerized assessments are a vital part of the future of cognitive testing. CANTAB PAL, a test presented on touch screen, is being used in leading scientific and clinical institutions worldwide and by major pharmaceutical companies in their clinical research. This widespread use has resulted in over 70 peer-reviewed publications in dementia. Across a number of studies, the PAL test shows very high levels of sensitivity and specificity in differentiating mild Alzheimer's disease from healthy aging and clinical depression. Furthermore, impaired performance on the PAL test has been shown to predict rate of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with MCI (Swainson et al., 2001; Blackwell et al 2004, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2009; Egarhazi et al 2007; Chandler et al 2008) and in community dwelling samples of older adults (de Jager et al., 2002, 2005). Performance on the PAL test has also been shown to be associated with CSF amyloid beta:tau levels (Barnett et al., 2011).</li>
<li>Beyond its scientific credibility, any test used in a primary care setting must be easy to use, fast and reliable. Ideally, the same test should also be appropriate for use within the context of a comprehensive diagnostic work-up.</li>
<li>Experience gained from the deployment of CANTAB PAL in over 1000 centres has shown that the elderly find the touch screen presentation intuitive and easy to interact with, accommodating a broader range of motor function than other computerized interfaces or even pencil and paper tests.</li>
<li>The wide availability of iPad and other similar devices enables CANTAB PAL to be made available to mainstream healthcare for the first time. This form of the test, known as CANTABmobile, is particularly well suited for use in primary care settings. By using adaptive methodology, the test is completed within 5-7 mins.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile offers key benefits in being both language invariant and culturally neutral. The test instructions are automatically administered using a voiceover in the language selected onscreen. Currently 18 language options are available within the test, including American English and Latin American Spanish. This facility reduces the cost of translation services and ensures patients are assessed quickly regardless of their language. The voiceover and automated stimulus presentation also enables full standardization in test delivery, allowing non-specialist health care professionals to administer the test, again reducing costs and improving quality.</li>
<li>The test takes 5-7 minutes, and automatically finishes if the patient fails at a given level, avoiding patient distress, and ensuring efficient use of time. The results are automatically scored comparing performance against a database of more than 4000 adults, fully adjusting for age, education and gender. The test instantly produces a single page report which clearly indicates the suggested action using a simple traffic light system. The report can be immediately emailed, printed or saved as a pdf.</li>
<li>The CANTABmobile test platform also includes computerised rating scales for depression and activities of daily living, fulfilling the criteria for other aspects of the wellness check, reducing risk of misclassification due to depression. The outputs for these are similarly included in the physician report.</li>
<li>Furthermore, CANTABmobile allows monitoring patients over time (Fowler et al 1995, 1997, 2002), and also anonymized data collation across systems, achieving the aim of facilitating public health outcomes research.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile has been developed for primary care physicians alongside a partner product covering a multi-domain toolkit designed for specialists.</li>
</ul><p>In summary, CANTABmobile delivers a high level of scientific rigor and patient/practitioner convenience. Furthermore, the computerized format enables many additional and desirable features. Embracing computerized solutions, both in primary and specialist services, will enable effective early detection of memory loss and provide an expedient route to diagnosis and intervention.</p>

<p>How does the National Alzheimer's Plan address long term care insurance with Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p>In MD, perhaps nationally, if a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, they are NOT eligible for long term care insurance policy -- the very thing they need!</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Plan is promoting diagnosis; however this will PREVENT those individuals from getting the type of helpful insurance they need.</p>
<p>What is the plan doing to address this?</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. Together, with our more than 1,900 member organizations, we serve our nation's most vulnerable citizens: more than 8 million adults and children with mental illness and substance use disorders. We are committed to providing comprehensive, quality care that affords every opportunity for recovery and inclusion in all aspects of community life.</p>
<p>The National Council is, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>The National Council believes, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments the National Council will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:center"><tbody><tr><th scope="col" style="text-align:center"><strong>Goals</strong></th>

<td style="text-align:center"><strong>$156.0 million</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:center"><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the single priority of the Plan; its other four goals are evidently of very limited importance.</p>
<p>The National Council does not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But achieving any of this by 2025 is probably wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>The National Council understands that those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere, but this is a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>The National Council strongly urges HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are some sections of the plan that need to reflect behavioral health issues.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (though it emphasizes biological research), but it does not mention the need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, which probably are over-used currently and are dangerous. Non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers also need information about how to detect a co-occurring mental or substance use disorder and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. It should be noted at the very least that people with AD in crisis often are referred or taken to psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, who are expected to provide treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders--end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with serious and persistent mental illnesses who do not recover over time, as is true for many people with schizophrenia and other treatment refractory mental disorders. People with serious and persistent mental illness also often develop dementia, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment tremendously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other settings such as homes, assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful--such as assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders become too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay or in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>Finally, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The National Council hopes that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what needs to be included in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. The fact of the matter is that good care, care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia and the stress experienced by their family members, could result in vastly improved quality of life for them.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking a cure when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS OF CONSTANT CARE FAMILY MANAGEMENT SUBMITTED<br />
					TO HSS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					MARCH 5, 2012</strong></p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunity to offer our comments and recommendations regarding the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p>As memory care experts, our Autumn Leaves assisted living communities provide families and residents with compassionate care and innovative solutions that help our residents create a sense of well-being in a comfortable, home-like environment. While reviewing the Draft Framework, we agree with our industry partner, The Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA) that the framework is a good start but there are more components that need to be added to the story.</p>
<p>The recommendations below offer ideas, interpretations and new measures in the draft where we think the strategy can be better fortified to help industry professionals, and residents and their families make more informed decisions while promoting the need to educate, train, detect and respond faster to this deadly disease. Thank you for the opportunity to hear our voice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					Training and specialized programs need mandating for general practitioners, and the healthcare industry overall to recognize early signs and symptoms. Requirements need to be established for individuals 70 years of age and older. Parameters, tools, programs and interview questions that allow physicians to screen for Alzheimer's and dementia need to be implemented much like the way breast cancer checks and prostate exams are set up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					While guidelines for delivery of high-quality care and measures are needed, even more important is the focus on specialized cognitive care activities such as the way to evaluate an individual's ability to complete day to day activities. The goal should be to improve an individual's life by identifying their remaining abilities and offering recommendations and strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					More training and programs need to be implemented on the potential impacts of cognitively impaired individuals, and how transitions disorient and stress the individual.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Better controls and programs need to be established to understand family systems which can oftentimes present a barrier to diagnosis and treatment. Identify the cultural dynamic of communication in order to offer support, education, awareness and help. Likewise, provide support and assistance for younger families so they can have access to the latest information: where to get help, programs designed to provide that help and community outreach services to offer support.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					More awareness programs and information about the importance of planning for healthcare decisions and disease progress need to be available. The primary physician and social worker roles need to be better quantified so they can better help families navigate through this process. Recognition of specific dementia care and related long-term care settings must be identified by policy makers and the insurance industry. More help is needed to assist families with guardianship and how to plan ahead, understand how to deal with crisis moments and realize they need professional legal help for healthcare issues and financial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Programs, training and information need to be available to help educate families and individuals on recognizing abuse and exploitation. Consequently, safety programs, education and training need to be implemented to address issues like wandering and safe return/finding.</p>
<p>A series of safety programs need to be implemented to help:</p>
<ul><li>Caregivers prepare their homes for a loved one living with Alzheimer's.</li>
<li>First responders such as police, fire department, EMS and emergency room personnel understand the necessary steps to take when aiding individuals who are living with Alzheimer's or dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As the disproportionately high rate of African-Americans versus whites living with Alzheimer's continues to rise, more educational services need to be available in the African-American communities to help increase a greater awareness and knowledge-base of the warning signs of Alzheimer's and dementia. The Alzheimer's Association statistics illustrate that the age-specific prevalence of dementia has been found to be 14% to 100% higher in African-American.* The number of African-American age 65 and over will more than double by 2030, from 2.7 million in 1995 to 6.9 million.</p>
<p><strong>The Wandering Emergency</strong><br />
					Wandering is considered an Emergency. Although common, wandering can be dangerous -- even life threatening: speed is of the essence. The statistics show very poor outcomes for elderly wanderers missing beyond 24 hours, and many people cannot remember their name or address. They may become disoriented and lost even in their own neighborhood, and they may become fearful and hide. Many states do not track or report wandering and locating current, up to date statistics are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Wandering is an emergency situation and part of the disease process:</p>
<ul><li>6 in 10 people with Alzheimer's disease will wander.</li>
<li>18% of those with mild dementia wander.</li>
<li>50% of those with severe dementia wander.</li>
<li>Wandering has proven such a common behavior that experts predict 60% to 70% of all people with Alzheimer's will wander away from safety at least once during the course of their illness.</li>
<li>Many will wander 6 to 8 times before they are placed into a residential facility or an outside, qualified caretaker is brought into the home to help.</li>
</ul><p>At Autumn Leaves, we're exploring ways to adapt our communities into designated <em>Safe Havens</em>. We know as individuals lose more and more of their memory, they will often go in search of a particular person, place or thing.</p>
<p>We are working to provide a service where anyone in the public sector that finds an individual wandering, confused of their whereabouts or are lost, can bring that individual to an Autumn Leaves <em>Safe Haven</em> until authorities or family members are contacted. We want to be able to help the emergency responders, and give them the aid and support they need to return individuals back to their loved ones.</p>
<p>Our solution to this very serious issue is multi-faceted:</p>
<ul><li>Expansion of the Silver Alert Program needs activation standards set by federal legislation to ensure there is seamless integration nationally instead of state by state much like the Amber Alert system introduced in 1996. Approximately 29 states have a Silver Alert or similar programs -- all states need to implement and participate.</li>
<li>Education on wandering prevention needs implementation along with understanding GPS technology or emerging technologies.</li>
<li>The Safe Haven concept for 'found' wanderers needs regional awareness to inform the public where and how to find Safe Havens. Likewise, they will need to be informed of the steps in bringing Alzheimer's or dementia wanderers to safe communities.</li>

<p>I have worked in the healthcare industry for 20 plus years, specifically with the geriatric population. I am currently the Director of Therapeutic Recreation and Volunteer Services at a long term care facility in New York.</p>
<p>My comments, or rather hopes with this project are really very simple. I deal with individuals who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and other types of Dementia and have lived with it for years, by the time they come to our facility they may have lived in the community for 1 to 5 years before a loved knew that taking care of them at home was no longer a safe option.</p>
<p>My hope is that this project builds in funds for caregivers who provide treatment modalities such as therapeutic recreation, music therapy, art therapy etc., treatments that do not include psychopharmacological components only, treatments that treat the individual as a person with a personality, with nuances to their personality,or rather their new personality that has manifested itself via the disease. Things like painting, singing, reminiscing, cooking, gardening etc are in fact very important parts of treatment for the person living with Alzheimer's Disease, and are sometimes the most important aspect related to the quality of life for the person and their families.</p>
<p>Please know that those who provide this type of treatment are people like me, A Certified Dementia Practioner, with a Master's Degree in Community Health, a quality of life specialist, who treat the person as a person and not just a symptom. I do know that this is cliche, but please know how important it is for the day to day activities of these individuals to have meaningful activity with a sense of purpose and focus and most important...dignity.</p>
<p>Please build in funds for these disciplines in this industry, I know how utterly important it is to provide funding for research towards a cure, but these patients, these people, these grandmothers and grandfathers etc. Must have activity and must have some meaningful quality to their lives until the day we find a cure.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for your time and for working on this project.</p>

<p>I have read the draft and think it is great. I am a Gerontological Clinical Nurse Specialist and board certified though the ANCC since 1994. I am also a Certified Dementia Practitioner thru the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners. I think this type of certified educator would be beneficial. I would love to help in any way I can for this project.</p>
<p>And the final thing is that my Mom was diagnosed with AD last year -- so I am a caregiver as well. Thank you for this great initiative.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTARY RE: "DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE"</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect to the contributors and authors of this draft plan, I submit that, if finalized as written, it will do more to destroy the Alzheimer's community and set back any hope of progress toward a solution than anything seen to date in my lifetime.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>As written this is a blatantly politicized piece of campaign rhetoric. I, perhaps surprisingly, am a life-long Democrat and strong supporter of liberal causes who has burned a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors on behalf of liberal candidates starting with Adlai Stevenson in 1952, but I am and have been also a dementia caregiver for over 20 years. This Alzheimer's Disease issue SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! THE PROBLEM IS APOLITICAL, AND SO SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION!</p>
<ol><li>Starting with the Vision Statement. There is NO better vision than that of The Alzheimer's Association - "A world without Alzheimer's Disease".</li>
<li>Certainly President Obama should be given credit for his support, and his supporting statement deserves recognition in the plan, but other people such as former House Speaker Gingrich deserve equal recognition for their contributions toward developing and supporting these efforts as well.</li>
<li>This entire issue of age related cognitive impairment (I've read that there are nearly 100 probable types/causes) deserves the support of EVERY citizen, whatever their political persuasion, and this draft plan mitigates any possibility of achieving that necessary broad level of support.</li>
<li>Further, in the 27 pages of text, I count at least 8 specific references to the "wonderful" AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Why? One should be more than enough, Zero would be better since a) The administration is wavering on implementation with refusal to implement some parts of the law, b) the administration is providing multi-state waivers to other parts, c) there seems to be little agreement or consensus on interpretation of key elements among those few who have struggled to review those nearly 3000 pages, and lastly d) this controversial law has yet to be reviewed for constitutionality by The Supreme Court (partiallly or completely).</li>
</ol><p>I suggest that the intent of those statements can be preserved in a much less controversial way by simply replacing "Affordable Care Act" language with something like "existing and proposed legislation". I think that the PLAN might also allow for the possibility for proposing new, additional legislation should it be considered useful.</p>
<p>With respect to Strategy 1C, I feel it would be most appropriate to add an additional action to address the legal and ethical aspects of early detection. What about those people that show no signs of dementia but are discovered to have major plaque accumulations? Should they be told?</p>
<p>I agree that measurement of the disease's progression is extremely valuable to the caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals, but I think that more than imaging and biomarkers is needed. Today, the "gold standard" of American neurologists and gerontologists is probably the MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), although many more assessment tools have been developed and found useful around the world. Of even more significance is the Allen Cognitive Scale measuring patients ability to contribute to their care in later stages. The PLAN should include recommendations for assessment tool standards to be applied nationwide in evaluating AD/Dementia progression for use in clinical trials, medical reporting, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another observation formed from my having read the proposed draft report numerous times is that the research portion, despite expressing some valid points, still appears to be another somewhat disorganized "hip-shoot" relying on far too much luck and too little deliberate, well thought out planning. Dr. Eric Kandel said it best when he applauded the successes so far and recognized that this whole issue was extremely complex and we had a lot more to learn. The complexity of the challenges clearly represents a "system of systems" which the late Russell Ackoff defined to be a "mess". This entire program cries out for a well-organized systems engineering approach if any progress is to be made in an affordable, rapid manner. Ackoff would have been our guy, but perhaps a colleague or student of his might be found to accomplish this task as soon as possible. A few calls to the systems thinking community in Academia or the International Federation for Systems Research might identify some key people.</p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, I think we can rely on the following:</p>
<ol><li>Age related dementias (other than major vascular events) are slow in development (Some have said that AD may begin in a persons twenties).</li>
<li>AD mechanisms change as the disease progresses and as damage occurs.</li>
<li>Each stage may require markedly different treatments to achieve delay or prevention.</li>
</ol><p>Is it possible that we are discarding treatments because we are applying trials to an inappropriate stage of the disease? (or even to those that may be incorrectly diagnosed?) Can we confidently rely on the FDA to make the appropriate treatment decisions for all stages of AD? I assure you that the "front-line" families become more desperate as the disease continues it's slow progression. I further suspect that most people in the AD community care very little if the treatment is "FDA Approved". The issues really boil down to:</p>
<ol><li>Is the treatment available (anywhere in the world)?</li>
<li>Is the treatment affordable?</li>
<li>Where, when, and how can I get it?</li>
</ol><p>An example of a layman's assessment of possible "treatments" as of today is shown as Attachment 1 to this commentary.</p>
<p>With regard to rapidity, I also have seen other criticisms of the 2025 goal suggesting that a 2020 goal might be better. Certainly, I would like to see a goal of 2010, but I believe that 2025 might be attainable only if we restrict ourselves to those things that are in the "pipeline" today, which in turn have no guarantee of success. I would urge you to consider scheduling several goals, with separate time objectives, recognizing that we are in a cancer or AIDS-like program that might take 50 years to find a "cure". By the way, I also noted that "finding a cure" is not in the list of research objectives. Have you given up?</p>
<p>I would suggest starting as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Identify and treat risks (2012) - Suggestions for good/bad environmental and diet approaches (subject to vary with time and knowledge -- remember discarding our aluminum cookware?) This is like "No Smoking" in the fight against cancer.</li>
<li>Slow and/or stop degradation (2015) This is partially available now for those who respond to Aricept/Namenda combo treatment. Solutions are needed for the large number of people who do NOT respond favorably.</li>
<li>Early Prevention (2020)</li>
<li>Minimize Symptoms (2022)</li>
<li>Delay Onset (2025)</li>
<li>Reversal of Afflictions (2050) - "THE CURE"!!!!</li>
</ol><p>Of course, the above dates are unsupported figments of my imagination, but I hope you see the concept here.</p>
<p>I also found some statements and titles in the described actions that gave me a "where did this come from" moment. Namely, Action 1.B.3 that discusses clinical trials and international outreach. Do you intend to request non-citizens, off-shore, to participate in our clinical trials? This needs some explanation. Another point that underwhelmed me was Action 1.B.4. Is this just pro-forma government speak or is there a real point? Frankly, I am of the very solid opinion that Alzheimer's Disease is about as racially and ethnically diverse and unbiased in selection as is possible in all of humanity. Are you implying that there is bias in the clinical trial community? Is there managed selectivity in who gets the "stuff" and who gets placebo? I highly doubt that! In fact, I doubt that your assumption of higher risk for AD being either racially or ethnically related has any validity at all. I submit that the REAL reason for those observations lie in differences in life-long histories of environment, diet, and health care practices. For example, we are fairly certain that Americans (of my generation) of Greek or Italian ethnic heritage are at lower AD risk levels, most likely due to preferences for a mostly Mediterranean Diet. This risk reduction may not apply to younger generations if they've switched to Drive-Thru Bacon Cheeseburgers. In any case, I suggest that tracking data on historical environment, diet, and health care practices will be much more meaningful, and tracking racial/ethnic populations as suggested will provide little or no contribution toward improved outcomes.</p>
<p>A small, but significant, item that I have some issues with is the stated expected cost of nursing home care at $78,000. A much more representative (and far more meaningful) number can be shown if it were expressed as a range of state cost averages ($70,000 to $150,000) and further adjusted to determine the level of pre-tax retirement income required to sustain the nursing home option (don't forget to include costs for incidentals like toothpaste, shaving cream, haircuts as well as Medicare parts B,C, and D with those costs adjusted for "means testing").</p>
<p>I suspect you will be looking at $150,000 to $250,000 per year. Thus it will be much easier to understand the future economic pressures on Medicaid and will go a long way toward determining the adequacy of an individual's long-term-care planning.</p>
<p>Also, I am very disappointed that this draft plan promulgates the social stigmas so dreaded by those in the Alzheimer's community. I understand the enticement to encourage high funding levels and popular support through fear, but I believe this is counterproductive to the tasks of living with and caring for those with AD. I am also a strong supporter of redefining those people as being "deeply forgetful" as opposed to "Alzheimer's victims", "Alzheimer's sufferers", "Senile individuals", "People with Dementia" or "Cognitively Impaired". Please realize that NOBODY wants to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It WILL rapidly result in loss of life-long friendships, loss of independence, loss of self, loss of peer respect, etc. This is clearly why early diagnoses seldom happen, and why public education is SO important. The stigma extends and becomes tragic when overzealous and uneducated agents of Adult Protective Services who believe the unsupported and unproven claims spread throughout the Elder Abuse channels of government that "most elder abuse comes from spousal and parental relatives/caregivers". I believe that too many malicious prosecutions are executed throughout the country due to proliferation of this myth. Occasionally, States have admitted to errors, documented those errors, and revised state policies (see "HANDCUFFED" by Wisconsin DHS). Other states rigidly support their mistaken beliefs, and I have seen personally the destruction of families, and early, wrongful patient deaths not to mention large legal costs to these families or to the states if public defense is necessary.</p>
<p>Many caregiving families are threatened daily by the health care/ adult protection bureaucracy. Has no one heard of self-inflicted injuries due to agitation? This is why nursing homes use Posey Mitts (soft handcuffs) and load their patients with unwanted drugs. Should patients be arrested and confined if a caregiver is injured? Should caregivers be arrested and confined if a patient exhibits self-inflicted injuries? Should a caregiver be arrested and confined if a patient is inadvertently injured or bruised during an effort to protect another innocent person? Or attempting to protect the general public? Should families be destroyed, Power of Attorney ignored, and spouses of 50 years be separated without visitation upon arrest, with NO conviction? The Plan's legal advisors would provide a great service to the community by prioritizing for both home and professional caregiver's a list of who should get protection/arrest first: a) the general public, b) close bystanders, c) professional caregivers, d) home caregivers, e) spouses and children/parents, or f) the "deeply forgetful" themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some comments on caregiving support needs. The PLAN needs to clearly state as part of Goal 2 that the priority is to provide for in-home care as long as possible in order to provide more favorable outcomes, extend life and quality of life at less cost to both families and government taxpayers. My own personal experiences indicate that respite care for family caregivers and supervised productive day care experiences for the "deeply forgetful" are absolutely mandatory to the achievement of this objective. The only successful application that I have seen was a 1991-1992 experimental program in the State of Georgia with several counties participating. While I understand this program has ended, I believe it was well documented, and I guarantee that as implemented it was indeed a lifesaving experience for participants and caregivers.</p>
<p>As to Nursing Homes, reducing the inappropriate use of anti-psychotics is a good start, but further improvements are necessary, and should begin with significant modification to the criteria by which state licensing authorities evaluate these facilities. Current criteria covers physical safety very well, but ignore many quality of life issues that affect the "deeply forgetful" residents. We often need to remind ourselves that the deeply forgetful are NOT "empty shells", but simply require unique communication techniques. The Plan should look specifically at the results achieved by advanced compassionate thinking in facilities modeled after Lakeview Ranch, those practicing The Eden Alternative, Montessori based care for the "deeply forgetful" and suggest significant modifications to existing licensing and evaluation criteria that could be addressed by all State Licensing Authorities. Also, I am told that many facilities consider it to be too costly to maintain and update resident's care plans, apparently in direct violation of federal laws. This may be lack of education, but certainly indicates lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>Hospitalization offers additional caregiver challenges. "Deeply forgetful" patients require special care, and have special needs above and beyond normal expectations. Electronic (although privacy protected) records are a great idea but should be expanded to include primary caregiver advice and concerns. Hospital personnel need to understand time, behavior, and observation problems as well as the patient's inability to express needs, particularly if in discomfort and pain. Similar observations might be made about any social situation that is not a part of daily routine and familiar people. Examples such as travel (particularly by air), home care visitations, family outings, and especially holidays come readily to mind. People that interact with the "deeply forgetful" need to know that respect and personal dignity are paramount.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening.</p>

<p>OVERALL I FIND THE DRAFT PLAN A REASONABLE AND READABLE DOCUMENT, EVEN THE HHS BOILERPLATE. I HAVE SOME COMMENTS WHICH ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE, WHICH I WILL STATE BRIEFLY: MY WIFE, MARTHA, WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A/D AND COPD IN THE FALL OF 2007. I CARED FOR HER AT HOME WITH SOME RESPITE ASSISTANCE UNTIL I COULD NO LONGER DO SO IN JULY OF 2009. I MOVED HER TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER WHICH TWO HOSPITALIZATIONS MADE IT NECESSARY TO PUT HER IN A HOSPICE FACILITY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. IN JUNE OF 2010 I BROUGHT HER TO THE HOUSE ON HOME HOSPICE. I WILL NEVER REGRET DOING THAT. AFTER 55 DAYS, ON AUGUST 4th, 2010, SHE DIED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>PAGE TWO OF THE PLAN LISTS FOUR GOALS. TWO OF THEM ARE: "... ENHANCE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS' KNOWLEDGE ...", AND "... SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CAREGIVERS ...". THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GOALS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PROMINENCE AND A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. WHY? BECAUSE DISCONTINUITIES IN AVAILABLE MEDICAL CARE ARE A SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM - RIGHT NOW - AND ALZHEIMER'S SUFFERERS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE - RIGHT NOW. WE ALL HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY A CURE WILL BE FOUND FOR ALZHEIMER'S. BUT AN IMMEDIATE AND MORE ACUTE PROBLEM IS COHERENT AND GRADUATED CARE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, AND RELIEF FOR THE BURDEN THIS PLACES ON CAREGIVERS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US:</p>
<ol><li>IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET A DIAGNOSIS. AFTER TWO $600 SESSIONS WITH A MEDICAL "EXPERT" IN THE SPRING AND FALL OF 2007, HE STILL WOULD NOT DIAGNOSE A/D. OUR FAMILY DOCTOR, AN INTERNIST, HAD TO MAKE THE CALL AND BEGIN TREATMENT.</li>
<li>IN JULY 2009, AFTER A HELLISH TWO WEEKS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC TO GET THE RIGHT DOSAGE OF A/D DRUGS, THE DOSAGES STILL WERE NOT RIGHT AND OUR INTERNIST HAD TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS LATER.</li>
<li>BY THE FALL OF 2009 15-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS WITH OUR INTERNIST WERE NO LONGER ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS NO AVAILABLE MEDICAL "NEXT STEP". I FOUND THAT AT LEAST IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI, ALL THE GERIATRICIANS HAVE BEEN COOPTED AND ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL-HOSPICE, NURSING HOME OR HOSPICE INDUSTRIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR AND DO NOT WANT ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS. THEY PREFER PATIENTS WHO NEED MONEY-MAKING REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES.</li>
<li>MONEY IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER. WE HAD NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE PAID UP TO $254 A DAY. NURSING HOMES COSTING $230 A DAY HAD NO OPENINGS, PREFERRING PATIENTS NEEDING THERAPIES. I OPTED FOR A $90 A DAY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, WHICH WAS FINE UNTIL SHE WAS BED-RIDDEN AND HER NEEDS BECAME TOO GREAT FOR ASSISTED LIVING. AS IT WAS, BECAUSE OF THE 90-DAY EXCLUSION ON OUR NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WE BARELY BROKE EVEN ON THAT POLICY.</li>
<li>THE NEXT TRANSITION, AND IT WAS ABRUPT, WAS TO A HOSPICE FACILITY. THE HOSPICE BILLED MEDICARE $1000 A DAY FOR HER CARE. HER CARE THERE WAS PERHAPS TWICE AS GOOD AS IN ASSISTED LIVING, BUT IT WAS NOT ELEVEN TIMES AS GOOD AS THE BILLING WOULD SUGGEST. THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT IS A WONDERFUL THING, BUT THE HOSPICE INDUSTRY IS GETTING FAT ON WHAT IT CHARGES, AND IT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S.</li>
<li>THE LAST TRANSITION WAS IN JUNE OF 2010 AND IT WAS ALSO ABRUPT. I WAS TOLD SHE HAD TIMED OUT OF IN-PATIENT HOSPICE. I FOUND THAT NURSING HOMES WERE STILL NOT INTERESTED IN HER AS A PATIENT SO I OPTED FOR HOME HOSPICE. I PERSONALLY PREFERRED THAT TO A NURSING HOME, BUT EVEN THOUGH I HIRED A CNA AND AN LPN TO SUPPLEMENT MY EFFORTS AND THE HOME HOSPICE EFFORT, WHICH WAS UNEVEN, HER CARE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THAT IN A NURSING HOME . BUT, HOME HOSPICE STILL BILLED MEDICARE $250 A DAY, WHICH WAS MORE THAN A NURSING HOME.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I SAY AGAIN THAT CONTINUITY OF COHERENT AND GRADUATED MEDICAL CARE FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT AND RELIEF FOR THE CAREGIVER IS AN ACUTE AND GROWING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS GREATER EMPHASIS IN YOUR PLAN. IT IS A - RIGHT NOW - PROBLEM, NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHIPPED AWAY AT OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF MY WIFE'S COPD COMPLICATION, WHICH REQUIRED 24/7 OXYGEN, OUR ORDEAL WAS MERCIFULLY SHORTER, LESS THAN THREE YEARS, THAN IS TYPICAL FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. OTHERS HAVE IT HARDER THAN WE DID.</p>

<p>I HAVE DETAILED RECORDS FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID ABOVE. I CAN PROVIDE ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU NEED FROM ME.</p>

<p>As a 66-year old woman who is conservator for a relative with Alzheimer's and who has watched several other relatives lose their mental faculties and eventually all their other faculties before they died a very long drawn out death, I cannot urge you enough to increase the amount of money spent on research into Alzheimer's and other dementia diseases. Yes, Alzheimer's is devastating to the individual and possibly even more so to the families and caregivers.</p>
<p>When I see that HIV/AIDS research receives about $3 billion from our government whereas Alzheimer's, with 5 times as many affected Americans as there are American HIV patients, even with this new initiative will only get half a billion dollars, I truly don't understand why research into Alzheimer's is so underfunded. I also don't understand why HIV/AIDS patients receive much more government paid assistance than patients with most other diseases. I'm afraid the Alzheimer's lobby has not been vocal enough unlike the HIV/AIDS lobby. But I admire what has been accomplished in making HIV now a treatable chronic illness because of the resources invested in that research.</p>
<p>Don't waste a lot of funding looking for more expensive ways to diagnose Alzheimer's when simple questionnaires and interviews can determine that dementia is present or not. Since dementia is not contagious early diagnosis is only helpful for getting your affairs in order until a viable treatment is discovered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the drugs currently used for Alzheimer's have any long-term benefit and even short-term benefits are questionable. Basic research into what causes or leads to Alzheimer's is where most of the funding needs to go. Hopefully this could lead to understanding how to avoid Alzheimer's altogether as prevention is always preferable and less expensive than treatment. It is is important to include nutritional supplements such as curcumin and vinpocetine in the research since studies have demonstrated some success with several supplements. Just because they can't be patented by drug companies, not enough money is being spent on their research. How cost effective they would be for both patients and the health care system.</p>
<p>If prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is not found soon the cost to the government will be astronomical in the future, as families have less ability and inclination to care for dementia patients at home. I predict dementia patients will frequently be abandoned so they can receive medicaid-paid nursing home care.</p>
<p>I urge the Alzheimer's plan to be implemented quickly and research funding be increased exponentially.</p>

<p>In reference to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, as a psychologist I have found that I have been able to start the process of Alzheimer's identification by simple screenings such as MMSE or RBANS. If the Alzheimer's process is far advanced the screens alone can be sufficient, if not, it's an indication for further neuropsychological testing. I have found working in an outpatient primary care clinic that physicians rely on psychologists to help them with diagnosis of memory or other cognitive disorders. Psychologists and neuropsychologists then, should be an integral part of this initiative.</p>

<p>In relation to your research,published by the European College on Psychopharmacology, published by Reuters agency on 05.09.2011, from Prof.Dr.Hans-Ulrich Wittchen,I'm sending you the attached material.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SCREEN OF THE HEALTH IN THE HAIRY BACK</strong></p>
<p>Today we are living in a wold filed with tension, broken families, psychological whirlpool and local wars.The human self is torn apart, and it seems that prevents milion of people from being together and free.We consider that the reason for this is the Syndrom of the Emotional Breakdown (SEB),that has a visible external sign.We are convinced that there is a functional virus,that penetrates the limbic system of the human barain,as a result of improper emotional impact.</p>
<p>Reretfully,during the course of evolution,the human had developed his brain to a level,to be able to hurt himself by means of thoughts.There exist mental viruses,or functional viruses.They cause a contamination in the emotional assessments of the humans,and as a result of this he develops a diagnoses SEB.The contaminated person generates in the course of his daily life toxic thoughts that create in egological contamination.</p>
<p>In a person living with SEB, in the hairy back of the head could be visualised a red patch in different shades - from light pink , through bright red, to dark purple.It could be on spots , or on well-seen red figures- different variants exist.When the patch becomes dark purple, it means that this individuals is about 30-40 hours away from death.</p>
<p>We consider that the SEB is a reason for destruction of personality, the reason makes people live in disharmony with themselves and with society.</p>
<p>How could Homo Spiens be infected with the SEB f.virus?</p>
<p>By receiving improper emotional value,quarrel in a bus, short negative telefone conversation, scolding a child for breaking by accident the Christmas toy, not keeping the right of way on a crossroad, watching a conflicting T.V. show - in short experiencing negative feeling. (1)</p>
<p>The very act of infecting is a mental action, armed at hurting someone.In such a way an individual,or the society as a whole could be infected.Each person is in constant contact with other.Even the mere presence without talking, or seeing is a form of contact.</p>
<p>Long time ago the man had invented the mental weapon, but still there is no vaccine, or some kind of defence against the negative impact, that only humans are able to inflict upon each other.That is why when we are hurting others, we are hurt ing also ourselves.</p>
<p>After the f.virus gets in the limbic system it may be inactive for a period of time - sometimes it may take years before it strikes the host.An egological contamination of the planet is being created.</p>
<p>It has been observed, that in infants, the patch dissapears after a proper drug treatmentand parents care.There are adults with a well visible path, their body is fightingto reach the necessary balance.</p>
<p>A man is a buld in such a way, that from the day he was born till his last day he fights with the debalancing cataclysms.All the known pharmakopea exist in the human body - it is a system by itselfs. The patch is like a screen that reflects one's health status.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,still the drug or the vaccine to fight the SEB is not invented. There is a danger to human health when the SEB becomes host's essence. The f.virus contaminates the emotional assessment,which like a ruffled mirror reflects the incoming emotional values feelings like agression,envy,hatread, jealousy,indifference,addictional to alkohol, drugs,gambling,lonelines and pathology like diabetes,AIDS,cancer,cirrhosis, etc - the list could be quite long.There are different medical brands,fighting to balance the existing total disbalance.</p>
<p>For better clarity in determing the degree of contamination the following levels of SEB are distinguished:</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
					Humans,trying to get into conflict at first opportunity, or that are impartial to the suffiring of the surrounding people.The most typical feelings of these people are agression, hatred,jealiusy, greediness.The patch is light pink in colour,small in siza, andvery dangerous to to the host himself and to the surrounding.Family quarrels, cold blooded and cruel murders, divorces, etc. are due to the fighting hormons in the blood and cells of the host.We observe these people not as defendants,but as victims.Of course according to the law, everybody is responsible for his own actions.The people at 1-st level are most dangerous for themselves, and for the society as a whole.Their live is subjected to this plague of 21-st centuary.</p>
<p>Level 2- This level is causing the world economic crisis!<br />
					People that are infected with Level 2 cannot make a reightful assessment of the necessity of the investments for the benefit of the society.If we appoint a Level 2 infected person at leading position at a financial structure,the collaps of the institutiun is immienent. This condition is known as business destroyer.These are people that cannot distinguish between a friendly and enemy hand.Such people have difficulty finding a job, and cannot find their place in prosperous structures, if ultimately they get into such structures, it is for a very short time - 2 - 3 months.The patch is like drops of spray - small, red and very dangerous for the host's business.Such person is better not be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
					This is the level of the addicted to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, etc.These people think that being healthy or not is out of theirmanageability. Is there an alcoholic that considers that alcohol is dangerous to his health? Is there a gambler who does not belive that with the next bid he will get back the lost money, of not today, then tomorrow? The patch is red and big.It is very difficult to get out of this level, and it will long time.Large part of the body is contaminated, and this could be overcome only with relevant therapy and will.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
					This is level of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer high blood pressure, apathy, depression, psoriasis, etc. The patch is very big and pink to purple in colour.People at this level are better strict to medecines an diets, known to the traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Level 5<br />
					Level 5 is litle known, because there is no coming back.The patch is big purple - a warning that death is knocking on the door. Mothers had observed such patch at the back of their children that commited sucide.The patch dissapears 12 hours after death.</p>
<p>It is possible to suffer from chronic illness, without having SEB.It is possible to live the whole live without SEB.The patch is like a screen of the health status that warns, that if body could not cope by itself, it will need appropriate intervention - medical, egological or surgical.Many people live having the patch, but SEB had not turned to be their essence.</p>
<p>When SEB controls the man?</p>
<p>When the emotional perception is constantly distrubed.In a strong way the f.virus modifies the incoming emotional values.It is known, that when the SEB f.virus settles in the limbic system of the Homo Sapiens, it transforms the impulses to the pituitary. In the limbic system are built chains of neurous lymbic ways.Some of them by means of the talamic cores end in the cortex.In such a way the impulses coming from the limbic system are integrated into the nervous system.</p>
<p>Other ways end in the hypotalamic cores.Through the cores the functional influence is transmitted to the cores the functional influience is transmitted to the pituitary gland and to the entire endocrine system. Trough these ways an influence is effected also on the vegetative visceromotor cores.Thus the activity of the limbic system is interconnected with the endocrine orgnas, locomotive organs, the heart. They participate in the emotional behavoir of the individual.</p>
<p>The endocrine glands produce one ore several hormones.By means of blood flow these hormones reach all parts of the body, but effect influence only on some of them. A regulation of the function of the body is effected by means organic substances dispersed in body liquids. The endocrine glands excrete secretion in the blood.They are in close functional connection with the nervons system.When the improper emotional value enters the individual trough the way known to medicine, it is lead to the pituitary gland. The latter signals the the relevant endocrine gland, and in case the individual is contaminated by SEB, a hormonal ingredient is being created, which is of no need to the body in this particular moment.This hormonal substance jams the mitochondrias in the cells with parahormonal substance.</p>
<p>Thus the cell changes its mass.It cannot breathe and capsules itself, and cannot function properly. If this cell happens to be a nevron, pathologic change in the brain could occur, as a result of SEB. By this very mechanism excess quantities enter into mitochondrias of the muscle fibres, the structure of the cells of the locomotive apparatus changes, the structure of the host organs changes.</p>
<p>The foundations of the science called Egology, the studies and fights the SEB for more 24 years,are laid in Bulgaria.In a center Egology, for more 24 years the inflience of SEB is being ignored, more nine thousand photos are made to visualise the SEB. The cell mass of thousands of people is regenerated under a strict medical supervision. For the purpose of visualisation and indirect attack to ignore the SEB special test are created, that shows its avalibility in a person.Exist SEB-idirect neutrlalizators,Neutralizators are created that in an unexplainable way collect within themselves inorganic substances. The neutralizators like from the man the egological contamination.They change their colour without changing its structures.In the web seite egology by you can find filmed opinions thousands of patients that recover their health status after the SEB had been removed from them.In theses cases the SEB red patch fades.</p>
<p>The test are personal and for single use.They discover faultlessly the contamination,thus warning the individual.Exist also products, that help to balance the emotional status- internet side <a href="http://egologia.bg">http://egologia.bg</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, I wish to be involved in NAPA. I was a television executive, but I barely survived as a caregiver to my (once-adoring) obstinate elderly father and sweet but ailing mother, both with Alzheimer's which went undiagnosed for over a year. But after fighting through the medical system, endless tears, and depleting my parents' life savings and much of my own--I finally figured everything out medically, behaviorally, socially, legally, financially and emotionally. Passion to save others (especially from getting so frustrated they commit elder abuse) resulted in my first book, <strong>ELDER RAGE</strong>, a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, launching the <strong>COPING WITH CAREGIVING</strong> radio show, and becoming an <strong>INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER</strong> (CEU/CMEs) on Alzheimer's. I am compelled to educated on issues that so unnecessarily cost years of my life--and then nearly my life itself when I survived invasive Brst. Cancer. <strong>(Please let me know you received this.)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, submitted to the HHS Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong></p>
<p>The Pioneer Network is pleased to have this opportunity to submit comments relating to the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The creation of this plan represents an important opportunity to outline and launch a national approach to curbing a disease that negatively impacts millions of elders as well their families and communities. We agree that this national effort is a critical step for securing a brighter and higher-quality future for those affected by the disease today, as well as those that will be affected in years to come. Pioneer Network commends the Department of Health and Human Services and the Advisory Council on their action to move this agenda forward.</p>
<p>Pioneer Network is a national non-profit that serves as the leading national voice for culture change in long-term care and the promotion of person-centered care, dignity and choice for all elders. Pioneer Network achieves this mission by convening researchers, policy makers, regulators, providers, and consumers with a nationwide network of state Culture Change Coalitions to design and deliver the highest quality, evidence-based, person-centered approaches to enhancing the lives of elders, wherever they may reside. In the context of this approach, we submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for consideration:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Appropriate Domains</strong>: Pioneer Network is fully supportive of the goals of the plan as well as its comprehensive approach. Any responsible strategy to address Alzheimer's disease in the 21st century must include the elements already represented in this draft framework, with approaches targeting: research to improve prevention and treatment, care and support for people living with the disease and their families, public awareness, and measureable milestones. We are excited to see an emphasis on each of these areas, as they are the key to addressing the disease.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing the Person with Alzheimer's</strong>: There is no question that the need for increased investment in research to better prevent, diagnose and treat Alzheimer's is essential. In coming decades the impact of these efforts will be the ultimate discovery of a cure, with disease-modifying treatments in the interim. However, while strongly desired, such developments do not appear to be on the immediate horizon. Well in front of the horizon, presently straining our communities and healthcare system, are the more than five million people living with Alzheimer's today. These individuals and families need to know that while research moves us toward the future, their needs today remain a top priority; that they are not placed in second position to a potential greater good. Therefore, we recommend re-arranging the plan so that care for people with the disease is the #1 goal. By doing so, the plan sends a clear message that it is a top priority to serve people with the disease, by embracing, promoting and disseminating the many effective approaches to Alzheimer's care that are known today to improve quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Person-Centered Care</strong>: In the section entitled <em>Enhancing Care Quality and Efficiency</em>, the concept of "person-centered approaches to care" is noticeably absent. Person-centered (or person-directed) care approaches are the cornerstone of high quality care for people with Alzheimer's, as these approaches allow the individual continued autonomy to live their life in a manner consistent with their own values, preferences and desires. Alzheimer's disease is a condition that robs individuals of many aspects of independence, yet does not have to remove their ability to receive care in their manner of choice. We view the concept of person-centered care as embedded so deeply in any approach to achieving quality care, that we recommend replacing section <em>2.D. Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em>, in the current document, with "<em>Promote Effective Person-Centered Approaches to Care Across Settings</em>." First, we would note that evidence-based, consensus-approved guidelines for the care of people with dementia in many of the settings of interest already exist, including nursing homes, assisted living, and home care, with well established standards of care present in other settings as well. Thus, it is not the identification of guidelines that is the key success driver to quality care, but rather the use of the person-centered approaches that are included in the existing guidelines. Second, there are many resources and programs, developed by leading organizations in the field, currently available to guide organizations on how to provide person-centered approaches to care. Thus, stepping back to focus on guidelines is more of a regression than a progression in the field; the person-centered care paradigm already exists and is ready for dissemination. Thus, we recommend the change stated above to focus on bringing visibility to existing person-centered approaches and promoting their use as widely as possible in every care setting. Even if the Council considers this proposed change to the language of 2.D as being a step too far, in order to ensure that the document is relevant in the current care field it is important to include an emphasis on person-centered care, which should be highlighted as paramount in any approach to care outlined in this national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Care Settings</strong>: Also in the section entitled <em>Enhancing Care Quality and Efficiency</em>, there is an important recognition that people with Alzheimer's live and receive care in many different types of settings. However, it is particularly noticeable in the introduction to this section, as well as in other areas, that several key settings are omitted. "People's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, and nursing homes" does not nearly cover the range of care settings available to meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's. Certainly the inclusion of "nursing homes" is not intended by the authors to include all forms of residential care, given that it has a particular meaning in terms of licensure that does not include: assisted living, board and care homes, independent living, continuing care communities, or even memory care homes, all of which are settings in which people with Alzheimer's live. Further, there is no recognition of the role of Alzheimer's-specific (or general) adult day care settings. We recognize it could be cumbersome to list all possible care-related settings in a document such as this proposed plan, but would minimally suggest including assisted living, memory care and adult day care, or secondarily, replacing "nursing homes" with "long-term care residences," "long-term services and supports," or "adult day programs and various shared residential settings." Any of these options would be preferable to simply neglecting these other important places where people with Alzheimer's spend their time.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Language</strong>: Anyone who has been involved in the field of Alzheimer's knows the importance of language; essentially the "PC of Alzheimer's." Language can be used to either empower people with the disease to maintain their personhood and dignity, or it can increase stigma and marginalize people with the disease. Overall, this document does a nice job with language and is respectful of those affected by the disease. However, there are a couple points we have noticed where Pioneer Network suggests simple revisions to help make the plan more empowering for those it is intended to serve.
<ul><li>Replace "Patient" with "Person with Alzheimer's" or a similar derivation, in every case. While directly receiving care in an acute care setting, people with Alzheimer's may in fact be "patients" of the healthcare providers; yet in the scope of their everyday life, this is a fairly infrequent occurrence. However, at all times, they remain the individuals they have always been, though now they are living with a disease. Referring to someone as a patient is depersonalizing and implies identification as a medical record number, rather than as an individual. On the other hand referring to someone with the disease as a person helps maintain their identity and promotes involvement in decisions about their own care and experience.</li>
<li>Replace "facility" with "home" or "care community," in every case. The word "facility" implies institutionalization, which promotes stigma in the sense of needing to remove people with Alzheimer's from the general community. Despite the fact that assisted living residences or nursing homes offer support and care, they serve primarily as the person's home. The person needs to live in this new supportive home for their own well being, not in order to remove them from interacting with the larger community.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on this Draft Plan. Pioneer Network appreciates the chance to share our widely held perspective that caring for elders in the most effective and appropriate ways will not only enhance quality of life for individuals but make us stronger as a society. Our Network and its friends believe that people deserve the opportunity to continue to thrive and live up to their full potential until the end of life, despite their limitations, including those presented by Alzheimer's disease. This plan represents an important chance to move the field and society forward in thinking about Alzheimer's both in terms of the future impact of high-quality research and in terms of the present impact of high-quality care. Please feel free to contact the Pioneer Network with any questions, or to access the many resources available to promote quality of life for all elders.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <strong>DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong>.</p>
<p>The Virginia Assisted Living Association (VALA), representing assisted living providers from throughout Virginia, as well as thousands of residents and employees served by these providers, supported the passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. We strongly support the goals outlined in the Draft Framework, but we are disappointed in the lack of acknowledgement of the importance of and the extensive use of assisted living services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Assisted living is long-term care service provider, that offers a more affordable home and community based alternative to skilled nursing care. Assisted living providers focus on the resident and offer services that are unique to the individual needs of the residents to allow for individual choice and help residents maintain dignity and respect. Assisted living is a professionally managed, community-based option for seniors and disabled individuals to use when needing assistance with activities of daily living, including specialized care for individuals with memory loss.</p>
<p>Statistics will show that consumers prefer assisted living care over institutionalized care settings, which is directly contributing to the drastic increase in the population numbers of assisted living communities. As reported in the 2009 Overview of Assisted Living (research conducted and analyzed by Acclaro Growth Partners), more than 1/3 of all residents living in assisted living communities have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or a related dementia. The US Government has evidence of this in its release of the 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities as conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, which stated that 42% of the residents living in residential care have Alzheimer's disease. This number is expected to continue or even increase as the levels of care and the options of care continue to expand within assisted living communities for memory impaired residents.</p>
<p>We respectfully request HHS to acknowledge and to include assisted living as a viable option when educating and caring for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. We also request that the word "patient" be replaced with the word "individual". Below is listing of some of our recommendations of changes to the Draft Framework...</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2. Add licensed assisted living communities to the list of settings in the opening paragraph after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.B Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.C Change patients in the title to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Add assisted living and a transition options from the home to assisted living and from hospitals to assisted living</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Change patients to individuals and add assisted living to the list of transition settings after "home"</li>
<li>Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families, and add assisted living to the list of care settings after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize, respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for your time and consideration of these comments, and please contact me should I be able to offer you assistance in this ongoing Plan.</p>

					Feedback on the Draft Framework for the<br />
					National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) supports and applauds the development of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.</p>
<p>With appreciation for the magnitude of the task at hand and the complexity of the issues, LBDA is providing limited feedback that is a) relevant for dementia in general and b) an important consideration specific to the spectrum of Lewy body dementias (LBD): dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).</p>
<p>An estimated 1.3 million Americans have LBD, which features progressive dementia plus varying combinations of symptoms (especially at onset), ranging from parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations, to REM sleep behavior disorder, a severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications, mood disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Both clinical diagnoses within the LBD spectrum feature Lewy body pathology, but the timing and severity of symptom onset differs.</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies represents approximately 20 percent of all dementias and is the most frequent dementia type misdiagnosed clinically, most often as Alzheimer's. Features that differentiate LBD from Alzheimer's at the early stage include visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder and results of neuropsychological assessment.</p>
<p>Most older adults with Parkinson's disease have some degree of cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 80% of people with Parkinson's will ultimately develop dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease has not yet become common knowledge among clinicians. There is no general public awareness about dementia in Parkinson's disease. Caregivers of people with PDD report to LBDA that the progression to dementia ultimately proves to be their most difficult caregiving challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It's not always Alzheimer's. </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the importance of communicating the plan in a manner that is both straightforward and understandable by the general public. While Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, there are millions of Americans whose lives are deeply affected by related disorders like stroke, LBD and frontotemporal degeneration; while they receive nominal mention in the background material as being included in this plan, there is no mention of them in the draft agenda.</p>
<p>Public awareness and education is one of the core goals of the draft agenda. LBDA urges the names of related disorders be included in the opening statement of the draft agenda, so that educating the public about the most common forms of dementia begins now and continues throughout the advancement of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, through public relations efforts of federal agencies, disease advocacy organizations and academia.</p>
<p>As the plan receives coverage in the media, deliberate inclusion of related disorders will also minimize disenfranchisement of Americans affected by lesser-known, non-Alzheimer's dementias like LBD, many of whom might easily infer the omission indicates the federal government does not appreciate that their plight is as fraught with burden as those dealing with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<p>While improving the timeliness of diagnosis is important, the Lewy Body Dementia Association strongly recommends the inclusion of the word 'differential' when referring to diagnosis.</p>
<p>A general dementia diagnosis or an inaccurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease leaves people with LBD at risk for exposure to potentially severe or irreversible medication side effects. (Approximately 50% of people with DLB who are exposed to neuroleptics will experience a severe reaction.) Inaccurate diagnosis also prevents the opportunity to prepare families for the complexity of LBD symptoms, treatment and high toll of LBD caregiving. Accurate differential diagnosis not only leads to more appropriate therapeutic interventions but also improves the selection for study candidates in research trials.</p>
<p>Primary care physicians must become more familiar with the top four causes of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's, LBD, stroke and frontotemporal degeneration. Delayed or inaccurate diagnoses are further compounded by the low percentage of referrals from primary care physicians to specialists. Simple screening tools to highlight when a referral is warranted for differential diagnosis are urgently needed, especially for people with LBD.</p>
<p><strong>Care Quality </strong></p>
<p>When assessing the care needs of persons with dementia, it is essential to look beyond the cognitive deficits and their impact on employment, incidental activities of daily living and activities of daily living. In the case of Lewy body dementias, care quality must also address motor symptoms (such as the risk of falls), behavioral problems, sleep and autonomic issues. Other professionals who regularly provide care for people with dementia include specialists treating sleep and autonomic symptoms as well as physical, occupational and speech therapists.</p>
<p><strong>Care Guidelines across Care Settings </strong></p>
<p>Given the increased rate of hospitalization of people with dementia, hospitals should be included in the list of care settings for which dementia care guidelines and measures are to be developed. Many hospitals are not equipped to provide adequate care to people with dementia, especially those with behavioral problems, leading to excessive or avoidable treatment with antipsychotic medications. (This is especially dangerous to the person with LBD, who may experience modest to significant decline without a return to their baseline from as little as a single dose of haloperidol.) Additionally, consideration should be given to non-cognitive symptoms, such as motor problems, which affect activities of daily living and increase fall risk.</p>
<p>As LBD is a multi-system disorder, routine care coordination between multiple physicians is particularly challenging with LBD. By changing medications without consulting the treating neurologist, another physician may unknowingly exacerbate any one of several LBD symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>In addressing the long term care needs of people with dementia, caregivers need more accessible resources to provide quality care for the person with dementia in their own home as long as possible, while also maintaining balance of the equally important quality of life for the family caregiver.</p>
<p>Patient advocacy groups should be included in the draft framework as an important source of counseling, support and information to patients and families upon a differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness </strong></p>
<p>The general public needs to be educated about the difference between dementia and the disease processes that cause it, much like the education the public received about HIV and AIDS. Few people understand that dementia is sometimes treatable. Educating the public that dementia is a symptom requiring medical attention, not a disease in itself, will help de-stigmatize both dementia and the many related clinical diagnoses.</p>
<p>In order to improve the reporting to physicians of all dementia-related symptoms beyond memory problems alone, such as those seen in stroke and LBD, it is imperative that the general public learn that the most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, stroke and LBD, and what symptoms should be reported to their physicians.</p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association is encouraged at the expansive nature of this draft agenda, especially as it pertains to the impact of dementia disorders not just on the patient but on the family caregiver as well. We look forward to following the progression of your work with great anticipation.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<td>Jeff Morby (Cure Alzheimer's Fund)</td>
<td>
<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities. Matching funds from the government for private initiatives, or the other way around, could generate considerably more private capital for focused, high level science than is the case today.</li>

<td>David Holtzman (Washington University School of Medicine)</td>
<td>In regard to 1E below, there is nothing wrong with what is stated but this is not the problem! We need treatments! If there is nothing to disseminate, 1E is a waste of time. Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately. This may require new partnerships within the Federal Government and with the private sector, and outreach through new mechanisms.</td>

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>

<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is writing to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in regards to the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. SWHR has key scientific recommendations that it believes the Advisory Council should consider as it is finalizing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>SWHR, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research. SWHR appreciates the work the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) is and will be doing to focus our nation's resources on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain, and the brains of men and women are inherently different. While it is common knowledge that men and women think differently, recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated that the difference goes far beyond thought processes. Sex differences have been observed in the anatomy of the brain, behavioral traits, and in the physiological responses of the nervous system. Differences are also noted in the aging process and for generative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Significant differences have been found in men and women who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine, explained in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that "Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women: up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology, whereas it is found in only 8-10 percent of age-matched women." Abnormalities caused by Alzheimer's disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms for men and women with the disease, which may lead to the need for different treatment decisions.</p>
<p>In October 2011, SWHR hosted a one-day scientific roundtable of experts to discuss what is known about sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. The meeting focused on basic and clinical science perspectives, as well as those of the caregiver, and included input from industry scientists. Participants were asked what research questions needed to be answered for progress to be made in the disease. Key research recommendations from the roundtable are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Research on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease, specifically examining sex differences in the transition from normality to early stages of disease to dementia, and from dementia to outcomes.</li>
<li>Research on the influence of sex steroids, bioenergetic vulnerabilities, synaptic function, and cognition in the brain as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Re-examination of existing data for potential sex differences to help define the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and publishing sex-specific results.</li>
<li>Research on the differential impact of the caregiving role on men and women and design interventions to provide more effective services</li>
</ul><p>From the meeting it was clear that research on Alzheimer's disease must account for sex as a basic biological variable and include sex-specific analyses. This type of analysis would be an extremely useful component of a national strategic plan to combat Alzheimer's disease. Approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women, which is why it is extremely important to ensure that the clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent, manage and treat Alzheimer's disease include an adequate number of women within their study population to perform a sex-specific analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR strongly encourages that these recommendations be incorporated in the Framework goals and strategies and be a part of the continued discussions and work of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>In addition, SWHR would like to provide comment on several of the specific goals and strategies. Strategy 1.B states that, "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions." SWHR agrees and advocates for appropriate representation in clinical research based on the disease prevalence in the population, with the specific goal of enrolling sufficient numbers of men and women to achieve statistical significance in the resulting sex-specific data analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR believes that under Strategy 1.C, identifying early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease requires knowing whether there are any particular differences evident based on sex, race, age, or ethnicity. The reporting and analysis of such data should be a part of the strategy even if the results show no difference, as that is important to determine.</p>
<p>In Strategy 1.E, SWHR recommends amending the draft to require the reporting and analysis of sex, race, age and ethnicity in the research findings, as these factors directly impact the quality of the findings disseminated into medical practice. The reporting of these differences, or lack thereof, influences the knowledge and identification of disease by the public health system, including patients and caregivers.</p>
<p>The quality and efficiency of care under Goal 2 would be increased by the measurement of sex and gender differences as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. SWHR further recommends that gender be a part of the timely and accurate diagnosis strategy of 2.B as well as education and support to patients in Strategy 2.C. The more accurate and informative the information that is provided to patients, family members and care givers, the more likely it will be that they understand and are able to be engaged in medical decision making.</p>
<p>As women age, many experience comorbid illnesses and diseases, making the coordination of care even more critical. Strategy 2.F is critically important as, "coordinating care...can help reduce duplication and errors and improve outcomes," especially for those patients, particularly women with multiple chronic diseases. Coordinated care will also help to lessen the difficulty of decisions made by many women who are responsible for making the majority of healthcare decisions for their household.</p>
<p>While SWHR believes that the groups mentioned in Strategy 2.G are unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease, we feel that it is important to include women who are disproportionately affected in general as well as within these subgroups. We recommend that women be added as a subgroups being disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer's disease. It is known that approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women. Moreover, there is a need to examine the data by sex within each population identified in Strategy 2.G, including within racial and ethnic minorities</p>
<p>While SWHR agrees that information and training should be given to caregiver in a culturally sensitive manner, as stated in Strategy 3.A, it is important to note that this information should include information on sex and gender differences, as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. Providing caregivers with any information available on these differences would allow them to better support and care for persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In Goal 4, SWHR believes that the public would benefit from being provided with Alzheimer's disease facts and information specified by sex, race, and ethnicity. This will help ensure that they have all available knowledge, including information to address the widespread confusion and misconceptions surrounding Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the disease will allow for the development of more effective preventions, diagnostic tools and treatments through support of the general public.</p>
<p>Data are an essential element of all research and a critical component to the advancement of our knowledge of sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. SWHR is delighted to see that in Goal 5 there will be, "efforts to expand and enhance data infrastructure and (to) make data easily accessible to federal agencies and other researcher." SWHR would like to see that data include information on differences that may exist between sex, age, race, ethnicity and culture and that it is made accessible to the public in order to advance research, treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease . from patients to caregivers to families.</p>
<p>SWHR believes the recommendations and comments it has provided to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services will help to advance more targeted therapies in Alzheimer's disease for both men and women. This will lead to a greater understanding of risk factors for both men and women and more sex-specific treatment of cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>Should the Advisory Council have any questions or would like more information please contact me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of Division 40 (Clinical Neuropsychology) of the American Psychological Association with formal written comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Our purpose in contacting you is to inform you that many of our nearly 5,000 members are licensed healthcare professionals qualified to evaluate and treat persons with Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. Clinical neuropsychologists, through receipt of specialized training in cognitive psychology, psychometric &amp; measurement theory, and brain behavior relations, have long been leaders in developing and investigating valid and reliable measures of cognitive functioning used for assessing and tracking symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Members of our profession have also developed and investigated many of the behavioral interventions currently used for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given our field's interest and experience with Alzheimer's disease we offer the following comments:</p>
<ul><li>We strongly urge you to include in Strategy 1.C the use of neuropsychological measures of cognitive functioning, which thus far remain more sensitive to diagnosis and tracking of Alzheimer's disease symptoms than any of the biomarkers that have been studied.</li>
<li>Neuropsychologists, by virtue of their training in brain-behavior relationships, are uniquely qualified for providing valuable services to patients with Alzheimer's disease and should be recognized among those other professions listed in Strategy 2.A recommended for receipt of expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act.</li>
<li>Practitioners in the field of neuropsychology are often among the first to identify symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's patients and are often involved in planning and advance care counseling. This should be recognized through inclusion of neuropsychologists along with physicians in the activities described in Strategies 2.C and 2.D.</li>
</ul><p>We appreciate this opportunity to clarify the role of clinical neuropsychologists in evaluation and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and would welcome any questions or requests for additional information for this or any other similar national initiatives.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) is pleased to submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (the "Draft Framework"), released by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on January 9, 2012.<sup>1</sup> BIO represents more than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.</p>
<p>As the representative of an industry that is devoted to improving health care through the discovery of new therapies, BIO believes that any framework for improving diagnosis and care for serious, complex illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, must include measures to provide access to innovative treatment options, including new drugs and biologicals. We are pleased that the Draft Framework specifically includes strategies for enhancing scientific research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, coordinating research with international public and private entities, and facilitating the translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs. <sup>2</sup> We offer the following comments to make these strategies more effective.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Draft Framework Should Include a Strategy to Protect Patient Access to Innovative Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>The draft framework correctly recognizes that after research findings are published in the clinical literature, "additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately."<sup>3</sup> In addition to being shared with patients, caregivers, and practitioners, new clinical evidence also must be adopted into health plans' coverage and payment policies in a timely manner to ensure that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools that address the eight cognitive domains that may be impaired in Alzheimer's, as recognized in the NINCDS-ADRA Alzheimer's Criteria: memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving, and functional abilities.<sup>4</sup> This is particularly important now because there are exciting new diagnostic tools and treatments for Alzheimer's disease on the horizon, at the same time our health care delivery system is undergoing dramatic change, from the creation of Accountable Care Organizations to increased packaging.</p>
<p>There are several ways the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can protect patient access to care. CMS should assign Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes in a timely manner for new drugs and biologicals to facilitate claims processing and payment by all health plans. CMS also should expeditiously add new cognitive tests to Medicare's Annual Wellness visit so that beneficiaries will have access to this service on a regular schedule and without out-of-pocket costs. In addition, CMS should work with stakeholders to identify new preventive services and issue national coverage determinations that add those services to Medicare's preventive benefits. Other payers, including Medicaid and private insurance plans, as well as the state agencies that regulate health plans, will need to act promptly on similar matters to protect access to innovative diagnosis and care for patients within their programs as well. CMS and other payers also may need to reconsider their current rules on coverage and payment to support adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers, and to ensure that bundled payment systems do not discourage the use of novel therapies. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework be revised to explicitly acknowledge the need for prompt action by Medicare and other payers to provide comprehensive coverage, coding, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease to help meet the needs of this vulnerable patient population.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Draft Framework's Strategies Should Support the Development of Treatment by Facilitating Participation of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease in Clinical Trials </strong></p>
<p>BIO recognizes that no progress can be made without clinical research, yet we also realize that it is difficult for many older patients to participate in trials due to comorbidities and limited access to sites of care that offer trials. These obstacles are particularly significant for patients with Alzheimer's disease, who may have more difficulty deciding to participate in a trial or remaining in a trial unless they have strong support from their family members and caregivers and health care practitioners. The Draft Framework notes that "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions."<sup>5</sup> BIO believes these efforts are needed. Enhanced outreach is essential to increasing participation in clinical trials through educating patients' families and caregivers, facilitating their access to the patient's health information, and supporting their role in helping patients make treatment decisions. These efforts also need to be applied across all research efforts -- in the U.S. or other countries, public or privately funded -- to encourage optimal participation in these essential trials. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework specifically recognize the need for enhanced efforts to address the factors that frequently inhibit patients with Alzheimer's disease from participating in clinical research. To facilitate this, we recommend that the Secretary involve, consult and engage with industry to address those factors through "new partnerships and outreach efforts."</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>BIO appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Draft Framework. We look forward to continuing to work with ASPE to refine and implement this plan to improve diagnoses and care for Alzheimer's disease. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding our comments. Thank you for your attention to this very important matter.</p>

<p>I was informed by our national affiliate, the Assisted Living Federation of America, that the recently released "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease" omitted Assisted Living from all strategies and recommendations, with the exception of the strategy on elder abuse. We fully agree with their comments submitted on January 20, 2012.</p>
<p>In addition, I am writing on behalf of LeadingAge Colorado. We are the state affiliate of ALFA and LeadingAge. We represent the full spectrum of aging services and senior housing providers, including assisted living residences and nursing homes. In Colorado we have worked with providers, regulators, legislators, consumers, and other advocates to ensure that their are care options for seniors as their needs change over time. We have particularly looked at initiatives to allow more individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders to have home- and community-based options through our Medicaid Waiver program.</p>
<p>In coalition with the Colorado Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association we have spent a great deal of time in recent years educating policy makers about the important role that Assisted Living Residences play in providing an alternative to expensive nursing home care. The state chapter has been particularly helpful in our efforts to increase Medicaid waiver funding for assisted living residences in Colorado. We know that Medicaid recipients have been inappropriately placed in nursing homes when their diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders did not require twenty-four hour nursing care. We also know that demographic projections for our state include a higher than average projection for individuals who will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders. Not only does it not make fiscal sense to omit this residential option from a national plan, consumers and their family members prefer the home-like environment and resident centered philosophy of care provided in Assisted Living residences.</p>
<p>I urge you to include Assisted Living Residences in this draft framework for the national plan. Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS OF THE RI ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION (RIALA)<br />
					SUBMITTED TO HHS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					JANUARY 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>.</p>
<p>The Rhode Island Assisted Living Association and the forty eight of providers who are our members supported passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act one year ago. We are pleased to see the Administration is currently pursuing a plan for a coordinated national strategy to address Alzheimer's disease. While the Draft Framework is a good start, we were dismayed to see the lack of acknowledgement of the role assisted living has in caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. In Rhode Island alone our members care for 3,500 residents most of whom experience some cognitive loss.</p>
<p>As you are aware, assisted living is a home and community based alternative to skilled nursing care. The philosophy is resident centered and the care is provided to support individual choice and help our residents maintain dignity and respect. In the past decade consumers have shown a preference for assisted living over more institutionalized care settings. The population of assisted living residents with Alzheimer's and related diseases is rapidly increasing. According to the 2009 Overview of Assisted Living (research conducted and analyzed by Acclaro Growth Partners), more than 1/3 of all residents living in assisted living communities have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or a related dementia. A survey of the top 80 senior living providers by Senior Living Executive in 2011 confirmed that 17% of the total residents served by these top providers are residents living in special memory care accommodations. The 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics released data that 42% of the residents living in residential care have Alzheimer's disease. We expect this trend to continue as many consumers prefer the state of the art programming that has been developed for memory impaired residents in assisted living. Indeed there are some assisted living companies that are dedicated exclusively to caring for residents with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>How can assisted living communities not be part of a national plan to address caring for people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia? The fact is assisted living is becoming the most popular form of residential care and services among consumers. Assisted living is a professionally managed, community-based option seniors and their families can turn to when needing assistance with activities of daily living, including specialized care and service for seniors with memory loss.</p>
<p>The senior living business is growing to meet the demands of seniors with memory loss. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing &amp; Care Industry estimates there are 105,000 memory care apartments available in custom built, appropriately licensed senior living communities. Most of these apartments are part of a special neighborhood within more than 36,000 assisted living communities. About 600 memory care-only communities operate in the U.S. However, due to growing demand from families needing full time assistance with the care of a loved one with memory loss, more capacity is being added each year, but growth rates will need to increase in order to serve greater consumer demand expected in the next five to ten years.</p>
<p>Regardless of the increasing popularity of professionally-managed senior living communities as a care option for seniors with memory loss, both government and private sector reports continue to confirm that assisted living communities are more affordable than nursing homes, and potentially even more affordable than home care depending on the level of need and situation of the family and senior. Additionally, options like offering home care to every senior are not practical given the shortage of healthcare professionals interested in serving seniors.</p>
<p>Social and safety benefits of assisted living communities should also be considered for seniors with memory loss. Studies continue to demonstrate that seniors with mid to late stage Alzheimer's disease thrive with a meaningful and purposeful life. Assisted living communities help create this life for their residents with memory loss. Professionally trained caregivers focus on the seniors' interests -- it could be as simple as singing songs, playing music, painting pictures or holding their hand. What's more, other residents and people are around as a supportive social network for the senior. Additionally, due to the professional and social nature of an assisted living community, more people are around to observe the resident to help both promote and protect his or her quality of life.</p>
<p>I am sure you can understand my concern that assisted living was not included in any of the goals or strategies that referenced care setting for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Assisted living has been and will continue to be an option that can provide not only the most appropriate setting for individuals with this disease but a cost effective option as well.</p>
<p>Assisted Living providers in RI have been huge supporters of our local Alzheimer's Association Chapter, through frequent sponsorships of fund raising events; such as the walk and the golf tournament. Our industry helped create the Culinary Challenge Event that has raised a significant amount of money for the RI chapter. I was shocked to read that, to date Assisted Living has been left out of the frame work for a national plan.</p>
<p>The recommendations below cite some specific places in the report where we would appreciate the inclusion of assisted living.</p>
<p>We also respectfully request that the word "patient" used through out the document be changed to "individual" or "resident". While we understand that someone under a physician's orders is called a patient, individuals residing in assisted living and other home and community based options are referred to as individuals or residents. Thank you for your time.</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2. Add licensed assisted living communities to the list of settings in the opening paragraph after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.B Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.C Change patients in the title to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.D Add assisted living as a care setting after "physicians office"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Change patients to individuals and add assisted living to the list of transition settings after "home"</li>
<li>Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families, and add assisted living to the list of care settings after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize, respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) is a non-profit collaborative of eleven national organizations that represent a unique blend of key stakeholders in assisted living. CEAL promotes high-quality assisted living, serves as a convener to bring together diverse stakeholders to discuss and examine issues related to assisted living, helps bridge research, practice and policies that foster quality and affordability, and maintains an objective national clearinghouse of information and resources about assisted living.</p>
<p>The CEAL commends the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy for developing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to address the growing need for treatment and services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their loved ones.</p>
<p>Assisted living plays an increasingly important role in providing services for persons living with Alzheimer's disease in a safe, structured community based setting. Over 31,000 assisted living communities across the United States provide care and services to nearly 750,000 residents; with more than 40 percent of those individuals living with some form of dementia.</p>
<p>Services offered in assisted living that can benefit individuals living with cognitive impairment include health monitoring, medication management, assistance with activities of daily living, social activity programs, nutrition services, and others. Offering these services in a structured and secure environment creates a unique solution to meet the immediate care and supervision needs of persons living with Alzheimer's disease now and in the future. Indeed many states have special disclosure and staff training requirements for assisted living communities that provide dementia care.</p>
<p><strong>CEAL Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Because assisted living is clearly a setting of choice for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, we recommend the following technical edits to Goals 2 and 3 outlined in the National Plan:</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency<br />
						"High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis through the end-of-life and in settings including people's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
<li>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support<br />
						"People with Alzheimer's disease and their families need supports that go beyond the care provided in formal settings such as doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and/or assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
</ul><p>On behalf of the CEAL board of directors I thank you for this opportunity to comment on the draft framework, and I offer our support for the ongoing work of the advisory council and the Department in implementing the important goals outlined in the National Plan.</p>

<p>I am writing today to express my concern regarding the draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. I stand with the Assisted Living Federation of America and the Alzheimer's Association in their call to include assisted living communities in this discussion. Assisted living communities play a vital role in the lives of memory impaired residents. The omission of assisted living is completely unacceptable. Below are the changes/additions that we want to see included in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<ul><li>We request that the word "patient" used throughout the document be changed to "individual" or "resident". While we understand that someone under a physician's orders is called a patient, individuals residing in assisted living and other home and community based options are referred to as individuals or residents.</li>
<li>Please add "licensed assisted living communities" to the list of settings throughout the document</li>
<li>In Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families.</li>
<li>In Strategy 3. D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings." In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>
</ul><p>As we all work together to fight this terrible disease, I eagerly anticipate the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Please do the right thing and include assisted living communities.</p>

Added information: "...Benchmark Senior Living where we provide housing and care for residents with Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias. I see daily the wonderful impact we have on our residents and their families, providing not only high quality care, but as importantly, an engaging lifestyle in a residential atmosphere...in my opinion, a night and day difference from the traditional "old school" nursing home which still exists. I am a member of the Tri-Country Partnership for the Alzheimer's Association here in Western Mass and volunteer in other capacities with the Alzheimer's Association. I also am a family member of a loved one who has experienced memory loss through Alzheimer's Disease which eventually required placement in a care community."</p>

It is my sincere hope that she will be able to remain at home until her passing, but if that is not possible and she begins to develop Alzheimer's or any other form of memory impairment, I will be seeking an assisted living community to accommodate her needs. We, as a nation, must care and protect our elderly and stop treating them as a "disposal" segment of our society."</p>

To me it is one of the most insidious diseases there is. It not only robs the individual of their memories but the most painful is the family members that are lost in a fog. The saddest moment I can recall was watching a granddaughter coming down the stairs crying because her grandmother no longer knew who she was. We associates working in Assisted Living communities are trained not only to deal with the loss of memory for the person but we have a heart for the family members that are so affected by this disease. I took the time that day to sit with the young lady and explain the process that her grandmother was going through. I told her that it was a progressive disease but assured her that her grandmother may remember her once again for a short time. This convinced her to keep coming. Over the next few months she kept coming and to her delight there were times that her grandmother remembered. Because of the care we give and the training we have that young woman got to enjoy the last months of her grandmothers life, occasionally as her granddaughter but mostly (in her grandmothers words) as that wonderful young woman that was always so pleasant. This is a small part of what we in the Assisted Living field bring to the table."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Submitted on the<br />
					Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					February 3, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>. CCAL is a national advocacy organization working to ensure that person-centered practices are always the foundation of all aging services and supports. Ensuring that person-centeredness is integrated into healthcare practices elevates the experience from a clinical one to a humanistic one. The human emotional experience is important to achieving well-being as are clinical outcomes. The bond between the person receiving services and the individual (as well as the organizations' culture) that provides a healthcare service must be based on the following four principles all working in harmony:</p>
<ul><li>Relationships - valuing the uniqueness of each person</li>
<li>Compassion -caring to build a connection and bond with the person</li>
<li>Empowerment - providing information and options to the person and their caregiver(s)</li>
<li>Autonomy/Choice - respecting the right of the person and their caregiver(s) to make their own choices</li>
</ul><p><strong>Global Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Person-Centeredness </strong></em></p>
<p>Nowhere can principles and practices of honoring the personhood of each individual be more significant than in a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, yet the draft framework is silent on person-centeredness. We respectfully submit that this National Plan should include person-centeredness in its philosophical foundation, core principles , strategies and goals as does the Department of Health and Human Services' National Health Care Quality Strategy and Plan (NHCQS): "Person-centeredness and family engagement will guide all strategies, goals, and improvement efforts". This is "one of the core principles intended to serve as the underpinning of NHCQS and should be reflected not only in the framework, but in how goals, targets, and plans are developed across health care and long-term care settings."</p>
<p>Person-centered language should be used throughout the National Plan. To honor the personhood of each individual and recognize that patient only refers to clinical services and not the broader holistic context, the term "patient" should be changed to "person" throughout the Plan; i.e., "Educate and Support the <em>Person</em> and their Family Members Upon Diagnosis". Indeed, person-centeredness should be a fundamental component of all prevention and treatment plans; i.e. Strategy 2.D - "Guidelines for delivery of high-quality <em>person-centered</em> care and measures of quality are needed…"</p>
<p><em><strong>Enhancing Quality of Life as well as Quality of Care </strong></em></p>
<p>This framework does not reflect our national commitment to providing meaningful lives for all older Americans. Enhancing quality of life and meaningful engagement for individuals with Alzheimers and related dementias must be a fundamental principle and a goal, implemented through training, education, and outreach strategies in tandem with, and comparable to, those for Goal 2 Enhancing High Quality of Care.</p>
<p>Meaningful relationships, purposeful engagement, social interactions and impromptu conversations all serve to enhance the individual's psychological, social and emotional well-being. All should incorporate the person's interests, preferences, strengths, and skills to best maintain their sense of self and to slow down the deleterious effects of the disease. The National Plan should include training for family, caregivers, and staff to heighten their sensitivity to and understanding of positive pathways for communication, interactions, relationships, and meaningful engagement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Family Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p>For those of us who care for loved ones with Alzheimers' and related dementias, we know this National Plan must move beyond encouraging "family engagement" to encouraging caregiver/family/ provider partnerships to best guide and enhance person-centered quality of care and quality of life.</p>
<p>Individuals and families should be empowered through interactions and resources so that they are prepared to make informed choices and be active participants and decision-makers regarding their loved one's care. We recommend the following goals and approach from "Partnering with Patients and Families to Design a Patient and Family-centered Health Care System: A Roadmap for the Future, A Work in Progress" (<em>2006, Institute for Family-centered Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement</em>)</p>
<p>"…Develop a shared vision and action plan for improving health care by advancing the practice of patient-and family-centered care and creating partnerships with patients and families in all health care settings and within the organizations and agencies having an impact on health care"</p>
<p><em><strong>Utilize Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Methodological Approach </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adopting the CBPR methodological approach to AD applied research efforts to best inform the work through multiple perspectives and expertise of community-based partners (representing key stakeholders, including family members, direct care staff, practitioners, social workers, long-term service providers, etc.) to inform the research, ensure its relevancy, and enhance understanding and dissemination across research, policy and practice sectors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Public Education Campaign </strong></em></p>
<p>We firmly believe that any public education campaign should highlight non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment options for enhanced quality of life and care.</p>
<p>We would encourage sustained community-based outreach to the general public through the creation of a "Real People; Real Life with AD" component of this campaign to enable the general public to meet, greet and hear from regular individuals and families who are going through this journey of AD-related life experiences and challenges. We are not suggesting celebrities or authors who have written about family caregiving. We do suggest including the voices, perspectives, and insights of individuals who are living with AD or whose loved one has AD.</p>
<p><em><strong>Improve Coordinated Dissemination of Information </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adding this goal as there is no national coordinated network of information about Alzheimer's and related Dementias for professionals or non-professionals. DHHS funds numerous AD research centers, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and initiatives throughout the country, i.e., Administration on Aging's AD Demonstration Grants; but information and findings are not networked and easily made available.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Psychosocial treatment modalities (non-pharmacologic) for AD should also be included in the framework for the national plan</p>
<p><strong>1.A</strong> Ensure that invited expert participants to NIH's May 2012 summit include an appropriate number of non-research, non-clinical dementia experts as well as family caregivers in order to best inform and shape the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>1.C</strong> Consider : a) ethical issues related to such efforts; and b) the potential psychological, social-emotional, medical and economic impact (and unintended consequences) on individuals and their families receiving a diagnosis 10 years prior to emergence of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>1.E</strong> Consider educational campaign on appropriate and safe use of psychoactive drugs and sedatives and non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment modalities as related to individual's quality of life</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A</strong> The plan should address solutions for recruiting and retaining high-quality direct care and paraprofessional workers. Best-practice models for AD training should be noted.</p>
<p><strong>2.C &amp; 2.D</strong> The plan should address how individuals and families can be actively engaged in decision making and act as partners on the care team if they so choose. Some individuals and families may just wish to receive counseling, support and information. Both should be addressed.</p>
<p>Palliative care and end-of-life care should be addressed. What interventions are available; what decisions need to be made to have personal wishes carried out by healthcare and long-term support system(s); i.e., individuals with Alzheimer's may want to leave a living will; families should understand the decisions that they may need to make.</p>
<p><strong>2. D CCAL</strong> suggests using a community-based participatory process in which individuals, families, and direct care staff can be partners with experts in developing the guidelines. We suggest examining the national Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) "Person-centered Care Domains of Practice" for HCBS which identifies domains of: personhood, relationships and community, governance/ownership, leadership, workforce practices, meaningful life and engagement, services, environment, and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>2.E</strong> Even "safe and effective" transitions can be traumatic for people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly for people with advanced Alzheimer's who are sent to emergency rooms for relatively minor conditions. Emphasis should be on: 1) limiting transitions; and 2) when transitions are necessary--how to make them safe and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3. Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend including families and direct care staff as active partners in the process of Expanding Person &amp; Family Support, from creating and disseminating culturally sensitive education and support materials to serving as Person &amp; Family Support Guides.</p>
<p>CCAL commends all who were involved in creating the framework for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias; and appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the process by providing person-centered feedback on its contents.</p>

<p>As a cognitive aging researcher, it's appalling that the new draft framework on AD does not mention the influence of lifestyle and the environment in <strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Assuming that AD is entirely a biological disease and it not influenced by the environment and the stimulation that a person receives goes against basic psychological, cognitive, and neuroscience research (e.g., even rats placed in stimulating environments show more neuronal growth). In addition to this complete oversight, such a framework for prevention assumes that there is nothing a person can do (i.e., "we'll give you a drug, and hope for the best"). Providing older adults with ways they can take control of their own future, and possibly influence their own likelihood of preventing AD (e.g., not smoking, not being overweight, stressed, and staying cognitively and socially engaged) is a far more universal and economical approach and avenue to take, in addition to research on pharmacological interventions. Psychological research has been occurring on AD and MCI for years, and failing to acknowledge this contribution is ignorant and hurts the overall goal of addressing AD.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that relying entirely on general practitioners, not trained in detecting dementia symptoms is a poor focus as well. Personally, my aunt was recently having some memory problems, and after having a MRI that was clear, was sent to her GP for follow-up. Without even conducting a MMSE, the GP told her she had dementia, and he would prescribe Aricept. He didn't conduct a MMSE until 2 weeks later, at which point she received a score of 27/30, and the GP said, "oh, I guess she's fine". There is no way dementia can be diagnosed with such little knowledge, and not even simply relying on the MMSE is sufficient. There is a rich literature on neuropsychological testing in diagnosing AD, other dementia types, and using those tests to detect MCI and other conditions. If we can't subject every person with small memory problems to a spinal tap, neuropsychological testing that has been developed to be sensitive to small changes in cognition is a front-runner in where to focus our efforts. Relying on GPs for this type of diagnosis is not appropriate.</p>

<p>In 2008, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. As one of 5.4 million people living with this debilitating disease, I currently live every day to make a difference. In fact, I am now an advocate for the education and eradication of this disease. While I only had an opportunity to watch it the second day of the NAPA meeting last month, I found it very interesting, yet my memory had already started to fade away. Some of my issues that I came up with are.</p>
<p>The 2020 date should be the date we shoot for as a cure date for Alzheimer's. 2025, should be the date that we eliminated it completely from all who have it, or at least stopped thee progression at their given state. People react to dates and when they see date so far out they will not even give it a second though, that is human nature. I use to see that with all the project I ever ran. While sometimes a date may be unrealistically, it is better to use one that is sooner than further away, keep the momentum going. That is what they also teach in project management.</p>
<p>I could see and hear the same frustration as I had from many of the committee members (both the non and federal) related to the date. Let's do what is right for those have been overlooked for so many years already. Use your heart to make the right decision. I have had the opportunity to speak to some of you, and you are not even sure why it's taken so long to get to this point. Let make this meeting count and make a statement to the World, that you do care about Alzheimer Patients and the injustice will end now.</p>
<p>I also feel the two days was kind of short and the original time given seemed to be cut short based on what needed to be talked about -- that's my viewpoint as an outsider.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have dial in conference number, so the public can also be included to make some statements.</p>
<p>While public can go to the meeting if arranged in advance, I would like to see a separate call in line for people who are invited in advance by phone, into the same conference call #. Just with priority over the drop in callers people.</p>
<p>While I think the use of metrics is great, it should not slow progress down at all. I would even recommend bringing in a master six sigma person who would be able to show how the spending of money now, can lead to the greater saving and man hours in both the health system and government from a short and long-term perspective. The long term savings numbers would blow their minds and they can relate to those expenditures.</p>
<p>As far as the 2 million needed, to fund this, which I still consider that amount to small and should also be raised, If no additional funding exist, then we should cut back from some of the other parts of the pie related to other high priority diseases and make it much fairer.</p>
<p>Everywhere you turn you see something related to Cancer and HIV. Our government contributes 18.7 percent of the NIH research budget to cancer, 9.9% to HIV, and just 1.4% to Alzheimer's. Why so little for Alzheimer's? There are many more people living with Alzheimer's than HIV, yet it receives much less funding.</p>
<p>We need to stop the disparity, or what I almost consider a form of discrimination.</p>

<p>My name is Dr. Steve Hume and I am a member of the Alzheimer's Association national Board. I was also diagnosed with AD at the age of 60.</p>
<p>Feedback: I feel the framework and recommendations to date are on target and broadly cover the important issues.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see a recommendation directed to Medicare that ensures it will develop and fund innovative in-home and in-community programs and services for persons with AD and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Many AD persons have Medicare but are inelligible for Medicaid. This precludes them from receiving in-home services, respite care and day treatment.</p>
<p>Many families cannot afford these services out-of-pocket. The result is either the caregiver reduces or eliminates their work hours or AD patients are forced into nursing home care prematurely.</p>
<p>When caregivers are unable to work the family suffers, more dollars are spent on welfare programs and the economy suffers as they leave the workforce.</p>

<p>Respite Care Funds for Care Givers:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>Respite Care funds must be made available for those people who lack private resources, funds, transportation and family support. Many caregivers provide 24 hour care in their home with no break, financial assistance or outside help. This leaves the care giver exhausted. Many of our nations care givers are elderly themselves. Caring for someone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia is a full time job. Care givers provide full time supervision, medication disbursements, ADL care (bathing, toileting and dressing), housekeeping services, meal preparation, transportation to and from appointments, etc. Many are unable to work due to the time required to care for a loved one. This depletes their funds.</p>
<p>The respite funds should be used to either place a loved one in adult day care program, hire a private duty aide/home health aide, have a senior companion volunteer come to the home, utilize nursing home and assisted living respite services or whatever community program that works for the Care Giver.</p>
<p>Currently, care givers are exhausted with no relief in sight. Many are depressed and lonely. They are cut off from their friends, church members and neighbors. They are unable to enjoy a quality of life many of us who are not full time care givers take for granted. They are unable to go to church, participate in a hobby or any other social event. Just going grocery shopping is challenging.</p>
<p>Isolation can also lead to abuse and neglect. Most care givers have the best intentions but abuse and neglect can happens when there is stress, isolation, lack of funding and lack of support.</p>
<p>Where there are respite services in a state the Care giver lacks funding and transportation. I saw first hand as a facilitator of a support group the desperate needs of the care givers. Some respite services are time consuming with lengthy paper work required. There may be waiting lists making respite services unattainable when they need it the most. Many community respite services require the care giver to transport their loved one and they are unable to provide this. Or there may be no respite community services with in their community.</p>
<p>There must be state and federal funds available for caregivers without funding to use for respite services. Each community should be looking at ways to keep the patient in the home and provide the care giver options such as home care respite services, assisted living and nursing home respite services and volunteer senior companion programs all of which provides options for the care giver.</p>

<p>I am a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner working with the Geriatric Population. I care for and diagnose Dementia on a very regular basis. After reviewing the document for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease I recommend the following amendments:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A </strong></p>
<p>Add Neuropsychologist to the list, they are invaluable in the accurate diagnosis of many of the other Dementia's and early identification of mild cognitive disorders, which will likely progress to Alzheimer's. There are not enough of these very specialized professionals to address the wave of dementia that will be occurring with this rapidly growing aging population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D </strong></p>
<p>There is a large portion of the population with Dementia, that would be best served by an Assisted Living Setting (not safe at home alone, no family support available, no skilled nursing needs). This large group often live in unsafe conditions because there is no funding source (other than private pay) for this intermediate level of care. Those that need help with meals, transportation, ADL's r/t safety (in and out tub), perhaps medication monitoring/reminders/set-up, daily checks, built in emergency call system in case of falls. This would not have to be manned by RN's like SNF in LTcare. But perhaps monitored by an LPN or Designated Geriatric Provider of some kind with training in the care of mild to moderate Dementia. Families often struggle with putting a loved one in a "nursing home", so those with Dementia are either provided too high or too low a level of care. This would very likely decrease the cost of expenditures for long-term care, as it would substantially delay the use of LTC.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.B </strong></p>
<p>Provisions for in-home respite care for those who choose to have loved ones live with them, is an invaluable service, which would allow for less caregiver burn-out and delay admission to a 24hr facility. Thus cutting down the expenditure of resources, before they are necessary</p>
<p>This Very complex issue will not be solved quickly or easily, I hope the above suggestions from a practitioners point of view are helpful in improving the quality of care and quality of life for those suffering with Dementia.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer Disease Comments from the Professional Affairs &amp; Information Committee National Academy of Neuropsychology</strong></p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN). NAN is a professional association with 3,500 members dedicated to the advancement of neuropsychology as a science and health profession. The majority of our members provide direct care to individuals who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, and many other neurological disorders. Our members work in many medical settings, interface closely with other medical and mental health specialties, and receive referrals from neurologists, physiatrists, neurosurgeons, oncologists, radiologists, family physicians, pediatricians, and many other healthcare professionals. We have expertise in the evaluation of normal and abnormal brain functioning, and our assessments are utilized in complementary fashion to neuroimaging and other neurodiagnostic activities. In addition to our work as diagnosticians, clinical neuropsychologists are actively involved in the research, diagnosis, and treatment/management of persons suffering Alzheimer's dementia and in supporting their caregivers (including educating and counseling loved ones, and consulting with staff in assisted living and long term care facilities).</p>
<p>NAN applauds your efforts to aggressively address Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this process. We have reviewed the HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer Disease and have the following comments that we hope will help facilitate your efforts in this regard.</p>
<p>Comments/Suggestions:</p>
<p>General: The language of the document is almost entirely directed toward physicians. Clinical neuropsychology offers its services as researchers and clinicians to the cause of addressing the burden of AD on patients and caregivers.</p>
<p>Strategy 1.C: Stresses the importance of the use of biological markers in the diagnosis of AD.</p>
<p>Please consider adding sensitive neuropsychological measures to this section in support of the biological measures. While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data.<sup>1,2</sup></p>

The diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease: recommendations from the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease. <strong><em>Alzheimer's Dementia</em></strong>, 2011; 7(3):263-269. (From the abstract: "The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia.")</li>

Epub 2011 Apr 21. (From the Biomarkers of AD section of the pre-print e-published article: "Progression of clinical symptoms closely parallels progressive worsening of neurodegenerative biomarkers," and "In the <em>symptomatic predementia, MCI, phase</em> biomarkers are used to establish the underlying etiology responsible for the clinical deficit." Both of these statements, and others in the article, emphasize the importance and effectiveness of neuropsychological/neurocognitive measures in the identification and tracking of clinical symptoms of AD.)</li>
</ol><p>				Neuropsychologists have developed very sensitive neurocognitive test measures that can be used along with biological measures to help characterize early, subtle symptoms of AD, which can then be used to stage neurocognitive decline and/or the effectiveness of experimental biological and/or behavioral interventions for AD. The above citations support the conclusion that neurocognitive assessment is the most effective means of measuring disease progression and functional status.</p>
<p>Goal 2, Strategy 2.A, &amp; Strategy 2.D: Mentions healthcare providers except neuropsychologists and psychologists.</p>
<p>Please consider mentioning neuropsychologists along with other care providers. Neuropsychologists provide a high quality of care and service to patients with dementing conditions and to their families and other caregivers.</p>
<p>Strategy 2.B: States "Research has helped identify some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease...(citation #5)."</p>
<p>Citation #5 (Jack et al., 2011, above) does not mention specific assessment tools, but assessment of cognition and function are hallmarks of the practice of neuropsychology. Please consider mentioning that neuropsychologists can be useful in the administration and interpretation of cognitive and functional assessment measures, and assisting in the accurate diagnosis of AD.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated by when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients as well as other factors. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup></p>

</ol><p>Strategy 2.C: "...even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment..."</p>
<p><em>Please consider including neuropsychologists as one source of identification of cognitive impairment (this is our specialty and physicians and other providers and care givers routinely refer to us for diagnosis.)</em></p>
<p>Strategies 3:A,B,C: The language is neutral regarding professionals.</p>
<p>Goal 4: "Health care providers..."</p>
<p><em>Many neuropsychologists, as well as social workers, nurses, etc., provide care to dementia sufferers and their caregivers (e.g., families, long term care facilities), and it may be helpful to mention this in these sections and in other relevant areas in the draft.</em></p>
<p>Strategy 5.B: "The National Plan is intended to be a roadmap for accomplishing its five goals. It is a document that is designed to be updated regularly. HHS is committed to tracking progress and incorporating findings into an updated National Plan anually."</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<p>Comment: Often Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias relate to a long continuum of treatment, home care and hospitalization. Upon review of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, I find a lack of related concern for the spiritual needs of both patients and family members/caregivers. On the multiple pages of the document I find no reference to spiritual care or an assessment of the spiritual need of the patient/caregiver.</p>
<p>Frequently a patient and his/her related caregiver(s) have a relationship to a church, mosque, synagogue, or other spiritual connection. When they do not, they may move into a long period when high-quality professionals with appropriate skill do not assess nor address their spiritual needs. Referral to a professional chaplain trained in spiritual care with patients and caregivers is a necessity for high-quality care.</p>
<p>Professional practitioners are encouraged in medical literature to take a spiritual history. Christina M. Pulchalski, MD., George Washington Institute of Spirituality and Health suggests that medical caregivers address a patient's faith, belief and meaning in life, the importance and influence of spirituality, the spiritual or religious community with which the patient connects, and how the health care provider might address spiritual issues in the course of the patient's health care.</p>
<p>I suggest specifically in Goal 2 and Strategy 3.A., references for referral to professional spiritual care providers and the creation of suitable spiritual suggestions that may be included after taking a spiritual history of the patient/caregiver especially at key points of treatment -- at diagnosis, upon true onset of symptoms, at hospitalization, institutionalization and especially anticipating end of life.</p>
<p>I suggest in <strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, paragraph 1.</p>
<p>"Providing all people with Alzheimer's disease with the high-quality care in the most efficient manner requires a multi-tiered approach. High quality care requires an adequate supply of professionals with appropriate skills, ranging from direct-care worker to community health and social workers/spiritual care providers to primary care providers and specialists. . ."</p>
<p>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</p>
<p>"Caregivers report that they feel unprepared for some of the challenges of caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease -- for example, caring for a loved one with sleep disturbances, behavioral changes, or in need of physical assistance can be an enormous challenge. Giving caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner helps them better prepare for these and other challenges. Examples of potential actions under this strategy include identifying the areas of training and educational needs, identifying and creating emotionally supportive, spiritually suitable, and culturally-appropriate materials. The assessment of spiritual needs, the distribution of appropriate materials to caregivers, and the use of information technology is needed to support persons with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is now available. The draft framework is structured around five ambitious goals:</p>
<ul><li>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025.</li>
<li>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency.</li>
<li>Expand Patient and Family Support.</li>
<li>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement.Track Progress and Drive Improvement.</li>
</ul><p>HHS is seeking input on the draft framework including Goals and Strategies and additional ideas that would inform the development of an action plan.</p>
<p>Please note that throughout the draft framework, the term "Alzheimer's disease," or AD, refers to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, consistent with the approach Congress used in the National Alzheimer's Project Act. Unless otherwise noted, in this draft framework AD refers to these conditions collectively.</p>
<p>HHS will be collecting input through <strong>February 8, 2012</strong>. Please send your comments to NAPA@hhs.gov. All comments will be shared with the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Are dental X-rays causing Alzheimer's disease?</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Caroline Rodgers. I am a researcher and writer specializing in public health issues.</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone here would agree that Alzheimer's disease has turned the prospect of aging into a scary and uncertain future that will rob many of us of our memories, our dignity and even our lives. I am here because I envision a world in which Alzheimer's is once again a rarity and our senior years are a true Golden Age.</p>
<p>Last year my article proposing that dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease was published in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses<sup>1</sup>. I also made a poster presentation on the subject at the 2011 Alzheimer's Association International Conference<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The technical explanation of my hypothesis is:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ionizing radiation from dental X-rays shortens the telomeres of microglia, which are critical to maintaining neuronal health. This reduces the lifespan of microglia, stranding neurons. Stranded neurons subsequently die, causing irreversible dementia. </strong></em></p>
<p>More simply stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>Head exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is causing us to outlive the brain cells designed to support our neurons all lifelong. </strong></em></p>
<p>NOTE: Dental X-rays are the only form of ionizing radiation that virtually all Americans are routinely exposed to at regular intervals throughout their entire lives, starting in early childhood. Although low-dose ionizing radiation amounts have been compared to background radiation exposure received during long airline flights, the amount of whole-body ionizing radiation received cannot be fairly compared to the amount beamed directly into the head.</p>
<p>It is not realistic to believe that decades of dental X-ray exposure would be without consequence for all people. The question is not, "Why should we consider whether dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's," but rather, "Why didn't we think of this sooner?"</p>

<p>30% to 43% adults have never visited a dentist<sup>7</sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence about half of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>UNITED STATES</p>
<p>1% have never visited a dentist<sup>8</sup><br />
					13% of people 65 and older have AD<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>Let's test this hypothesis against the facts </strong></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The emergence of AD symptoms is delayed 10 or more years following the presence of AD brain pathology.</p>
<p>Microglial telomere shortening would have a delayed effect on neurons because it reduces microglial lifespan, not function.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD mortality increased rapidly after 1979, making it the sixth leading cause of death by 2000.</p>
<p>Since AD symptoms are delayed by 10 or more years, it is worthwhile to look at health trends taking place in the decades before the surge in AD mortality. This was a time of major changes in the nation's dental health habits.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong> it wasn't until the '40s that X-ray machines were common in America's dental offices<sup>10</sup>. However, nearly two decades later, in 1954 . . .<br /><strong>1957</strong> only 37% had visited a dentist within the year, while 18% reported never visiting a dentist<sup>11</sup>.<br /><strong>2008</strong> 59% had visited a dentist within the year, with only 1% never having visited a dentist<sup>8</sup>.<br /><strong>2010</strong> The national average that had been to a dentist or dental clinic within the year was 69.7%<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to suffer AD-related damage.</p>
<p>It contains both microglia and neural progenitor cells which -unlike other mature brain cells -- keep dividing, making them more susceptible to radiation-induced damage.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Men die sooner than women following an AD diagnosis<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Older men have shorter telomeres than women the same age<sup>13</sup>, so they would have less time if their microglia telomeres were prematurely shortened.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Virtually all people with Down syndrome have AD brain pathology by age 40 -- but there is a wide variance in the onset of dementia<sup>14,15</sup>.</p>
<p>People with Down syndrome lose telomere length faster than the general population, but just like others, there is variation in newborn telomere length<sup>16,13</sup>. Also, people with Down syndrome are subject to many genetic dental anomalies that could entail additional X-ray exposure.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD prevalence is higher in urban areas<sup>17</sup>.</p>
<p>City dwellers make more dental visits<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD is increasing most rapidly in developing countries -- especially Latin America<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, many countries started providing free dental care to all citizens, such as Cuba in 1976, Venezuela in 1999 and Brazil in 2004,.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD does not respond to anti-inflammatory or cholesterol-lowering drugs -- even though AD is associated with brain inflammation and high cholesterol<sup>19,20</sup> .</p>
<p>Neither treatment can help neurons that have lost their support system.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Mentally stimulating activities initially delay AD, yet ultimately accelerate it<sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>Additional brain growth would eventually overwhelm microglia struggling to support existing neuronal networks.</p>
<p><strong>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's, it raises new questions and concerns, such as:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Could diligent dental care explain the increase in non-familial early-onset AD?</li>
<li>At what price, a smile: What are the long-term risks for orthodontia patients exposed to cone-beam CT scanners that create 3-D images -- at much higher radiation levels?</li>
<li>Could head X-rays after sports injuries contribute to early-onset dementia?</li>
<li>If dental X-rays pose risks, could brain imaging utilizing ionizing radiation to monitor AD accelerate disease progression?</li>
<li>Do plateaus in declining cognition relate to intervals between X-ray exposures?</li>
<li>Could the ratio of dental professionals to population be used to create accurate algorithms to predict dementia trends?</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are the prospects for Alzheimer's prevention, treatment or cure? </strong></p>
<p>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease, future cases can be decreased by eliminating or strictly limiting dental X-rays. Dentists can also turn to alternative imaging technologies already developed, yet not in common use. Interventions for people already exposed to dental X-rays yet without AD symptoms could include developing ways to safely transplant self-donated bone marrow or dental stem cells to replenish microglia populations. Other possibilities would be to develop ways to preserve or even lengthen microglia telomere length or to selectively remove permanently senescent microglia cells to stimulate replacement microglia that would actively provide neuroprotection. Sadly, there is no evident cure for people who have already lost their microglial support system to the point where enough neurons have died to cause symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Closing comments </strong></p>
<p>I don't know the answer to the questions I have raised in this short talk. I do, however, know that we have to look in new places with open minds to solve the puzzle of AD's emergence as a major killer and to restore health, dignity and luster to our "golden years."</p>

<p>While I am grateful that you have set a deadline for the Alzheimer's Prevention or to slow down the progression of the disease, 2025 is not nearly soon enough. There will be millions of more people with the disease by then, and millions of more lives lost. We need a cure or prevention and we need it now.</p>
<p>I am a caregiver for a mother with Advanced Alzheimer's and while it will be way too late to save her it can save me and millions of others. Alzheimer's and Dementia run in on my mother's side of the family; my Grandmother had it when I was a teenager and she lived with us until the end and so I have lived through this before and now again with my mother, my mother's sister also had Dementia and she passed away last year. It is completely devastating to watch and to go through, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, my father and I are completely exhausted, but we want to keep my mother home with us until the end. I am worried that I will have it very shortly because it seems to run in the family and it scares me to death after going through this twice I would rather be dead then to be diagnosed with this extremely horrible disease. I am a single women with no children and if I should get it next, I am worried what will happen to me, I will have no one to care for me and it terrifies me so much I can't sleep thinking about it. It robs you of everything, your memories, your thoughts, your independence, your dignity, you can't do anything at all for yourself anymore and you cry all the time, because you actually know something is happening to you and you are scared to death. That is how my mother feels every day. She cries all the time and says what is happening to me, why can't I do anything anymore, why don't I feel well, don't leave me I am scared, she thinks people are poisoning her and trying to kill her, she thinks she is lost. I could go on and on, but if you know someone personally in your family that has this horrible disease, then you know what I mean. Please try to get this done way, way sooner, at least by 2020, which is still way too late. Thank you for listening.</p>

<p>There are many young people living with Alzheimer's disease. Many of them are frustrated, frustrated, and more frustrated. Not because they have Alzheimer's, but because of the disparity and stigma surrounding this disease. The 2025 date is proof of the lack of interest to a cure.</p>
<p>Everywhere you turn you see something related to Cancer and HIV. Our government contributes 18.7 percent of the NIH research budget to cancer, 9.9% to HIV, and just 1.4% to Alzheimer's. Why so little for Alzheimer's? There are many more people living with Alzheimer's than HIV, yet it receives much less funding. More funding is desperately needed.</p>
<p>No one wants to talk about this disease. The people directly impacted by this disease do nothing because they are overwhelmed dealing with the disease. Alzheimer's disease impacts so many aspects of people's lives, careers, hobbies and the many things we take for granted each day. Most patients find it difficult to learn something new, which ends up creating many issues for the patient and family. Most patients die within 4-8 years of diagnosis. There are no survivors of Alzheimer's disease. Why are stars or famous people not proud to stand up and support this cause? There is no pretty outcome, but that is why their help is needed.</p>
<p>Today something can be done to change that. We can start by advocating for the cause. Let's start by speaking up for the many others who can no longer write, speak or have passed on. Please help support their cause like we do for others. We need to enlist the backing of famous people so the perception will change from what exists today. Remember, it does not only affect the older generation. Alzheimer's disease can strike way before the age of 65. This younger-onset version has an even bigger impact on those diagnosed with it. Alzheimer's disease is a crisis in America and the predicted cost of care will be $1.1 trillion, based on today's dollars, by the year 2050. The number of people diagnosed will more than double by then without our action now. This is the 6th leading cause of death, and the only one out of the top 10 causes of death in the US that cannot be prevented, cured, or even slowed down in its progression. It is very easy to read this article, experience a moment of sympathy, and then move on without doing anything.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this could one day affect you, your spouse, your son or daughter, their grandchildren, or even a close friend. Please do not wait until that day. Do something today.</p>
<p>Please help by joining the cause to make others aware of this debilitating disease and how it also affects young people. The youngest on record is 24 years old. Please reach out to the website so we all can work together to find effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Someone will develop the disease every 69 seconds. That number will increase to every 33 seconds by 2050.</p>

<p>Many of us believe that it is very important that the National Alzheimer's Plan address mental health issues in the lives of people with dementia and their family caregivers. That was the gist of the discussion that took place at SAMHSA on December 16 when a group of experts were brought together to provide recommendations for SAMHSA regarding NAPA. This past week I published a short piece in the <em>Huffington Post</em> that elaborated on this position a bit. I would be glad to provide more extensive ideas if that would be useful.</p>
<p>Here is the link to my piece. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-friedman-lmsw/dementia_b_1189082.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-friedman-lmsw/dementia_b_1189082.html</a></p>

<p>People living with Alzheimer's or other dementias often have mental health problems -- especially depression and anxiety disorders -- as well as dementia. Memories they have always relied on become hazy and uncertain. Knowledge and skills cultivated over a lifetime diminish. Relationships change or are lost. Ordinary activities at work, home or leisure become difficult. Eventually, other people may be needed to help manage finances, make plans, get back and forth from home, eat, stay clean or go to the bathroom. As these sources of identity, personal pride and satisfaction are lost, people with dementia can become deeply sad, fearful and/or angry. Sometimes their behavior becomes a challenge for people who care for them.</p>
<p>These obvious facts should be part of what drives our nation's preparation for the vast growth of the number of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias that will take place over the next two decades.</p>
<p>The good news is that pursuant to The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/</a>] signed into law in January 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has begun to develop a long-term plan regarding dementia. The planning advisory committee for this project includes a representative of the Substance Abuse and Services Administration (SAMHSA) as well as representatives of many other federal agencies. In mid-December SAMHSA brought together a small group of experts who recommended that SAMHSA speak to the critical importance of addressing mental health problems experienced by people with dementia, Hopefully, it will do so at the next meeting of the advisory committee, which will take place on Jan. 17 and 18.</p>
<p>That's the good news. The bad news is that there is a battle shaping up about what the nation's priorities regarding dementia should be.</p>
<p>Some argue that there should be one and only one priority -- investing in research to discover a cure for Alzheimer's or at least to invent medications to stop the ineluctable decline the disease brings with it. For example, in an editorial in <em>Alzheimer's and Dementia</em>, Zaven Khachaturian of the Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease by 2020 argues, "Ultimately, the only deliverable that counts is a credible plan of action that calls for significant and systematic increases in the allocation of resources and funds for Alzheimer's research... particularly in the discovery and development of interventions to prevent disability."[1]</p>
<p>Others of us believe that, however promising biomedical research is, it will probably not bring relief in time for the 5.4 million Americans who already have dementia or for the additional five to six million people who will develop dementia over the next two decades. [2] We believe that humane care to help them have the best possible quality of life is the critical goal. We see this not as competing with biomedical research but as work that is necessary in addition to it.</p>
<p>But even among those of us who are focused on the need for more humane and more effective services and supports, there is some dispute about the importance of mental health services.</p>
<p>In part, this is the result of an outmoded view about the separation of mind and body. Dementia has physical roots with mental manifestations. Many advocates for better Alzheimer's care and treatment focus on the physical roots and do not regard dementia as a mental health condition. Others of us believe that mind and body are inextricably intertwined and that both physical and mental health perspectives and interventions are needed to help people with dementia and their families to have the best possible quality of life.</p>
<p>Many mental health issues arise in the lives of people with dementia and their caregivers. In a recent article in the same journal that published Khachaturian's editorial, Constantine Lyketsos and others argue that "neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias." They cite "depression and apathy ... verbal and physical agitation ... [and in later phases] delusions, hallucinations and aggression" as particularly common and important to address with mental health interventions, preferably non-pharmacological interventions. [3]</p>
<p>Psychological understanding can also contribute to improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families even if they do not have diagnosable mental illnesses. Dementia is often thought of as an unmitigated horror, but the truth is that some people with dementia lead lives that they find satisfying. Helping people with dementia to retain a sense of self-worth and be at peace with who they are is a very important goal for them. [4]</p>
<p>Mental health issues also touch family caregivers who provide 80 percent of the care for their relatives with disabilities. They are at high risk for depression, anxiety and physical illnesses that contribute to burn-out. Solid research by Mary Mittelman has shown that psychological support helps family caregivers live better with the stress they face, resulting in delay in nursing home placement by upward of 18 months. [5]</p>
<p>If the National Alzheimer's Plan does not reflect these facts, life for people with dementia and their families will end up far worse than it needs to be. That is why I and many others are advocating [<a href="http://www.imstillhere.org">http://www.imstillhere.org</a>] that the plan establish meeting the mental health needs of people with dementia and their families as a core priority for our nation.</p>

<p>I was reading about the upcoming legislation regarding Alzheimer's. I am very happy our Government is taking steps to address this upcoming tsunami called Alzheimer's that is going to hit our country. I am not sure where to start? so i will start at the beginning my Mother was diagnosed 11 years ago with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the journey I am on with her and this disease. She is now in the late stage of the disease she does not know me very much but that's OK. What I learned from my experience was that there was not enough help out there for caregivers and family members of Loved ones with the disease!! The statistics are that 64% of caregivers of Alzheimer's are hospitalized or Die before their loved ones!! That has to change we need to be giving some tools to these people so they can survive the caregiving process. I took three years to go and investigate and learn everything I could so I could take care of my Mom the best I could. In that process i saw the need to educate the people dealing with their loved ones on how to take care of their loved ones while keeping their stress levels down!. I can't state the importance of this. If we could help everyone understand how to do this we would save Money those same people would be healthier staying out of hospitals and keeping the Health Care costs down. I am not sure if this interests you but if it does I have alot more to say about my experiences talking to thousands of people dealing with this disease. I Lead 5 support groups a month for my Church and the Alzheimer's Association locally. I am providing a link to a local article written about me for some background. I would be happy to help in any way I can. <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/care-333943-says-home.html">http://www.ocregister.com/articles/care-333943-says-home.html</a></p>

<p>I shared the following comments with the Alzheimer's Association about the draft of the National Plan (NAPA), and wish to share them directly, also, with your office.</p>
<p>My father was diagnosed from autopsy with Alzheimers and other related disorders. I am not a medical professional.</p>
<p><em>Comments:<br />
					I believe the document should mention related disorders as a group, or specific examples of related disorders such as Lewy Body Disease and Parkinson's Disease. It seems to me that research is headed in the direction of finding that the large group of people that we formerly referred to as Alzheimer's Disease patients are now being determined, by exam or autopsy, to have various related disorders, sometimes instead of or in addition to Alzheimer's Disease. The way the draft was written, I foresee that some patients/clients/test subjects could, at some point, be excluded if they are found to have a related disease. They could be excluded from participation or services. If the related disorders are not accounted for in this document, it may be possible that some research or projects become derailed, if the test subjects are found to primarily have one of the related disorders.</em></p>

<p>There is an ongoing focus on curing AD, However, with the continued emphasis on "cure" the immediate need is often overlooked or minimized. The actual beneficial need is for relief early on so as to increase the probability of quality of life for the individual AND the designated caregiver.</p>
<p>Even with the great promise shown in early trials J-147 will take years to come to market in approved use. There are several genuine advances that hold much promise yet they do not address the needs of the moment. Consideration must be given to those individuals and their loved ones suffering with this debilitating malady right now. As a civilized society we cannot stand idly by as we wait for a "cure" we must act with what will be of benefit today and improve the quality of life for those unfortunates. How can one not justify this morally and ethical position?</p>
<p>Florida currently has more than 10 percent of the reported AD population in our Nation. The impact on caregivers is staggering. There are more qualified AD facilities than any other state. The fact that this huge increase in AD confirmations is real and factual.</p>
<p>What is of great need is the early screening and detection of AD at the earliest possible stage. For many reasons this is not being emphasized, due to stigma or denial or other reasons. By placing an emphasis on early detection through education and PSA's (all media has a provision for such) highlighting local community screening facilities there will be an early means of detection and increased quality of life for all concerned.</p>
<p>We must take advantage of currently available meds for relief TODAY as the cure is remote and in the future. The acknowledged treatment of Aricept in conjunction with Namenda offers relief at present time. At least this will furnish an improved condition for the individual so diagnosed.</p>
<p>It is projected that the number of diagnosed AD patients could increase by 50% through the widespread availability of early screening that would lead to official diagnosis. With the advent of the "boomer" generation becoming into the known range it is felt that this is mandatory in order to provide relief for the coming wave of incidents.</p>
<p>Elder Care Advocacy of Florida has been long involved in this battle and participated in numerous seminars and panels over the years. As an effort with much experience it is felt that we must consider the needs of the "here and now" while we await further advancements in research and medical trials. We have had all too many friends and associates pass from this mind=robbing and life destroying disease that steals the very soul of our fellow loved ones.</p>
<p>The opportunity to be of service is always appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for your work on Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias. Please note that I support a more ambitious date than 2025 to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's Disease. This date affords no hope for those who are recently diagnosed and their loved ones. Alzheimer's was first identified in 1906; I believe we have the capacity to END Alzheimer's by 2020; we cannot afford to wait more than a decade to achieve this goal. Please revise your target date and give hope to the millions of Americans suffering from mild cognitive impairment, early onset Alzheimer's, and other devastating dementias.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to commend HHS for proactively working towards a comprehensive plan to address the personal and public impact of Alzheimer's disease. This plan is needed to ensure that there is proper allocation of resources to address dementias both empirically and clinically.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that the plan did not mention the field of Psychology. Psychological researchers have played an integral role in the knowledge base on dementias and have developed diagnostic tools which are highly specific, yet cost effective. Furthermore, Psychologists and Neuropsychologists are often called upon to make formal diagnosis of dementia, relay this diagnostic information to patients and families, provide psychoeducation and support, assist with advanced care planning, assist teams/families in identifying and using non-pharmacological strategies for managing difficult behaviors, and provide services at the end-of-life.</p>
<p>As a Psychologist within the VA healthcare system, I provide such services within our Community Living Centers (i.e., nursing homes). Psychologists are specially trained to understand the psychosocial factors impacting older adults, as well as cultural/diversity impacts. As such, Psychologists are poised to deliver high quality assessment and intervention services to persons with dementia and their families. Furthermore, Psychologists have unique skills in assessment and program evaluation which allows us to monitor and measure our work in a way that can be directly linked to cost savings. I have seen how Psychology's presence on the CLCs has led to more positive outcomes, such as the significant reduction of use of antipsychotic medications, reduced caregiver burden, improved mood functioning for patients, and reduced strain on staff.</p>
<p>The exclusion of Psychologists in this framework could have detrimental financial impacts on our ability to provide these services in the future. I strongly believe that the elimination of Psychology from the interdisciplinary teams serving dementia patients would have dire effects on the provision of quality care.</p>
<p>I appreciate your strong consideration of including Psychologists in this framework.</p>

<p>Thank-you for the opportunity to suggest several minor enhancements to the "National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>The third sentence of Goal 2 to "Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency" should be edited as follows, to be inclusive of the 114,000 secured Assisted Living settings in the US that provide specialized programming and care for those with various forms of Dementia and Alzheirmer's (data source, National Investment Center, <a href="http://www.nic.org/research/faqs1.aspx">http://www.nic.org/research/faqs1.aspx</a>):</p>
<p><em><strong>High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis through the end-of-life and in settings including people's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, licensed assisted living communities and nursing homes. </strong></em></p>
<p>Including this reference will balance the fact that the only other current reference in this document to the Assisted Living industry is within the context of abuse in Strategy 3.D.</p>
<p>The wording in Strategy 3.D provides information, but is not proposing any changes or enhancements to minimize the abusers or to properly recognize that the vast majority of those providing care for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias do "maintain the dignity, safety, and rights of peoples with Alzheimer's Disease." I propose the following wording enhancements:</p>
<p><em><strong>People with Alzheimer's disease are particularly vulnerable to financial exploitation, physical or emotional abuse, and neglect both at home and in institutional care settings <s>residential care facilities</s>.<sup>18</sup> Reports of elder abuse are handled by state Adult Protective Services, which is charged with responding to and resolving alleged abuse. State survey and certification agencies investigate abuse in licensed facilities, which may include nursing homes, assisted living facilities and board and care homes. AoA's National Long-Term Care Ombudsmen are advocates for residents of nursing homes, board and care homes, assisted living facilities, and similar adult care facilities and can help address issues related to potential abuse or neglect. National trend reporting of substantiated cases of abuse or neglect for those with Alzheimer's by care setting type, as a percentage of total residents cared for, should be enhanced to better inform the public of those settings most likely to provide the type of care and support expected and the low incidence of this type of abuse.</strong></em></p>
<p>Please let me know if you have questions that I may be of assistance with or need a clarification related to my suggestions for improving your plan documents.</p>

<p>I am a clinical psychologist with training in gerontology, working within the VA healthcare system as part of the Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) program. HBPC serves a population of chronically ill and disabled Veterans and their families, including many with Alzheimer's Disease, providing services within their home or assisted living facility. This program is a relatively new national initiative within the VA system and has already been shown to meet many of the initial goals for improving care and reducing costs. It is considered cutting-edge health care for this most vulnerable and complex group of patients. In recognition of the value of addressing mental health as well as physical health for these patients, HBPC interdisciplinary teams are mandated to include a full-time mental health provider, which is almost always a PSYCHOLOGIST.</p>
<p>The wide range of expert services that a psychologist can offer to persons dealing with Alzheimer's Disease -- including but not limited to cognitive testing, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric symptoms, caregiver support, and training of families and facility staff -- cannot be duplicated by any other professional discipline. Indeed, psychologists are integral to the clinical care of persons with Alzheimer's Disease, not only in my work setting within the VA, but across the nation in clinic, home, and nursing facility settings. In addition, it goes without saying that much of the most important research in the area of Alzheimer's Disease is conducted by psychologists.</p>
<p>I was shocked when I realized that the words "psychologist" or "psychology" do not appear once in the Draft of the National Plan. Psychologists are not listed as one of the essential disciplines under "Goal 2," though many of the services that we provide are noted as vitally important to focus on in the coming years. I see this as a serious error - not because of my desire to protect the "turf" of psychology, but because it simply does not reflect the reality of healthcare today for persons with Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I urge you to correct this omission and formally recognize the significant role Psychology already plays in the diagnosis and treatment of persons with Alzheimer's Disease. For example, the National Plan should include language to note the importance of supporting training for geropsychologists and funding for psychological services for these persons and their families.</p>

<p>My name is Mary Hogan. I am one of 8 older siblings of the late Bill Hogan. I submit this request to you today, December 30, 2011, in honor of my brother and hopefully for other families who are facing the challenges related to Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In January 2006, at the age of 45, Bill was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer's type. Over the course of the next 4 years his journey became far more complex. He experienced a very rapid deterioration during the last 13 months of his life and died of chronic aspiration pneumonia on February 25, 2010, two months shy of his 50th birthday. My brother was a member of a subgroup of individuals with Down syndrome that develop AD early, decline rapidly and face a premature death. This has been a great loss for our family and Bill's community at large.</p>
<p>Extraordinary efforts to advocate for Bill were required during the final years of his life. Active advocacy was sometimes lonely and often a frustrating process. Obstacles for advocacy increased significantly after Bill's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Our experience is most likely replicated in other families as well.</p>
<p>I write to you today to request the following considerations for the National Alzheimer Project Act Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services:</p>
<ol><li>People with Intellectual Disabilities, and their caregivers, should be included in future planning with the <strong>same access</strong> to appropriate care and support as individuals in the general population. The growing incidence of Alzheimer's disease will be mirrored in the ID population, most especially with individuals with DS who have a far greater likelihood of developing this insidious disease by age 60. Inclusion in any future planning will be ensure that this often marginalized group will have access to appropriate care across their lifetime.</li>
<li>Most often individuals with ID, including those with DS, are cared for by their families well into their adult lives, often by aging family members. Recognition of the need to enhance support for this group of caregivers will be critical in the future. I ask that NAPA Advisory Council recognize the need for improved dementia care for individuals with intellectual disabilities in conjunction with increased support for family members as caregivers and advocates.</li>
<li>Since individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, families, caregivers, agencies, medical providers and researchers will need to work together to maintain their "quality of life". Families facing DS/AD need access to information about both disease process and advocacy. I suggest a review of what has been produced by Alzheimer's Australia and the Australian government as a sample of what might be provided.</li>
<li>A consortium of providers (i.e. Alzheimer's Association, Health and Human Services, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities or Administration on Aging, UCEDD, families, and advocacy organizations, etc.) should disseminate best practice guidelines related to adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia. This will include training and education for care providers across a multitude of settings. I suggest careful consideration of the forthcoming document produced by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</li>
</ol><p>I am hopeful that in this day of limited funding the needs of <strong>all</strong> people with Alzheimer's disease will be addressed creatively and with the greatest of compassion and that the National Alzheimer Project Act Advisory Council will provide leadership and direction for the future.</p>
<p>I thank you for the considering this request.</p>

<p>We thank you for all of the work you are doing to implement the law and are excited to see the draft plan soon!</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>As the Co-founders and Co-chairs of the Bipartisan Congressional Taskforce on Alzheimer's Disease and House authors of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), we are writing to urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to continue its swift and efficient implementation of the Act. NAPA is intended to be transformative, creating a groundbreaking, far-reaching, and thoughtful National Alzheimer's Plan to improve care for Alzheimer's patients across the country and ultimately cure this disease.</p>
<p>We applaud the ongoing work of the Nation Alzheimer's Project Act's Advisory Council and federal agency working groups. We are pleased to hear that a draft National Alzheimer's Plan required by the law will be read by early next year. As you know, several of the largest Alzheimer's advocacy, care, and research organizations have submitted ideas and priorities for the National Alzheimer's Plan.<sup>1</sup> We hope that the agencies working to develop the draft plan will strongly consider these various proposals.</p>
<p>We provide below our recommendations for your consideration as you prepare the National Alzheimer's Plan:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Increase medical research funding and coordination</strong></p>
<p>As millions of baby-boomers age and retire, Alzheimer's is becoming a national pandemic, threatening to undermine our Medicare and Medicaid systems. Today the federal government spends $93 billion out of Medicare to care for Alzheimer's patients -- almost one out of every five Medicare dollars (18%) each year. This money pays for hospitalizations, doctor visits, and drugs associated with the disease. An additional $37 billion comes out of the Medicaid budget every year -- more than one out every 10 Medicaid dollars (11%). Taken together, that's $130 billion every year from Medicare and Medicaid that is spent on this one disease alone.</p>
<p>In addition, nearly 15 million caregivers provide approximately 17 billion hours of unpaid care to family members and friends with Alzheimer's, which represents a large drain on the time and the resources of families and employers. Now more than ever, we need to accelerate research breakthroughs in the causes, treatments and prevention of this disease and reduce the emotional and financial burden of Alzheimer's on families and federally-funded programs.</p>
<p>Basic research is our best hope for understanding the fundamentals of this disease and finding a cure. Currently, Alzheimer's research is underfunded across the federal government, academia and the private sector. According to data from HHS, Alzheimer's disease receives a franction of the research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) compared to other diseases. Today, the NIH spends about $6 billion a year on cancer research and $3 billion a year on AIDS research. Alzheimer's has five times as many victims as AIDS, yet receives only $469 million in research funding a year -- less than 1/6 the amount spent on AIDS research.</p>
<p>Deaths from AIDS, cancer, and heart disease have fallen in the last decade. As a nation, we should learn from our past successes. Prioritizing and funding medical research has lead to breakthroughs and treatments and ultimately saved lives. In the same way, we must expand funding for basic medical research for Alzheimer's disease, which continues to have a dramatically increasing number of patients every year across the country.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>It is also our hope that in drafting the National Alzheimer's Plan, HHS will also explore ways to better coordinate research and grants dollars within the centers and institutes of the NIH. Currently, over a dozen institutes at the NIH support or conduct Alzheimer's related research. Perhaps there is a need for an institute focused solely on the disease or a way to enhance data sharing amongst researchers. Whatever the solutions, the National Alzheimer's Plan should include concrete ideas to guarantee that all money, given through grants or used internally, is spent effectively and in coordination with other research projects in support of a larger research agenda.</p>
<p>In addition, we urge HHS to consider innovative projects to facilitate research and therapy development across public and private sectors. For instance, HHS should consider the feasibility of increasing accessibility to lumbar punctures for patients in order to develop national databases and registries for at risk patients. Cerebral spinal fluid tests are proven to identify those at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.<sup>3</sup> Increasing access to this screening technique would help facilitate entries into clinical trials, and, once therapies have been developed, identify those who should receive such therapies.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Incent private sector research and development</strong></p>
<p>Biopharmaceutical companies have approximately 21,000 ongoing clinical drug trials in the U.S., yet only 100 of them are focused on Alzheimer's disease. It is our hope that new incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and therapy development, including the development of new drugs, devices, biological products, biomarkers, or diagnostic tools, are included in the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>Federal agencies have adopted methods in the past for encouraging research and therapy development under adverse conditions, including: extended market exclusively for demonstrably effective treatments, priority review or fast-tracking by the Food and Drug Administration for treatments in the pipeline, review of guidelines regarding clinical trials, and patent life reform. It is our hope that the benefits and consequences of all methods are thoughtfully examined and considered in this case.</p>
<p>In addition, we urge HHS to consider ways to increase public-private partnerships for research and therapy development including possible strategic investments in start-up or growth companies engaged in advanced research and novel therapeutics, especially those companies willing to match funds from HHS.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Expand public awareness efforts</strong></p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Plan should call on relevant government agencies to work with local and state governments to develop public awareness campaigns around Alzheimer's disease, in the way HHS and the Centers of Disease Control have spearheaded public awareness campaigns in the past. It is our hope that the campaigns would focus on: the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the importance of diagnosis, how to access clinical trials, and the availability of resources and services for patients, families and caregivers.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Provide reimbursement for comprehensive diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Reports estimate that as few as 19 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease have a documented diagnosis of their condition in their primary care medical record.<sup>4</sup> African-American and Hispanic populations are even less likely to be diagnosed than whites despite being at higher risks for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Medicare currently covers diagnostic evaluations and some imaging tests. However, if the signs of dementia have not been detected in the first place, a diagnostic evaluation is not conducted. Furthermore, after a diagnosis has been made, time constraints and lack of reimbursement often preclude a necessary discussion with the newly diagnosed patients and their caregivers regarding the diagnosis, treatment options, and support services available. As a result, many people with dementia and their families are not effectively connected to resources to help them manage the condition and avoid crises.</p>
<p>With an early diagnosis, patients and families can prepare for the oncoming symptoms of the disease. Facilitating conversations between doctors and caregivers and providing resources for patients' families can help mitigate the number of hospitalizations and complications for patients and ultimately bring down Medicare costs.</p>
<p>H.R. 1386, the Health Outcomes Planning and Evaluation Act (HOPE) for Alzheimer's, which we co-authored, proposes that the Centers for Medicare And Medicaid Services develop a new Medicare reimbursement code for a comprehensive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to help drive best practices among doctors. This includes reimbursement of the following: screening of dementia, diagnostic evaluation, discussion with doctor and caregiver, and medical record documentation.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Expand outcome-oriented care programs and dementia training for healthcare professionals</strong></p>
<p>Models such as Independence at Home (IAH) and Resources for Enhancing Caregiver Health (REACH) have proven to improve the quality of care for patients and reduce health care costs by keeping patients in the comfort of their own homes longer and coordinating care services. IAH, currently a demonstration project slated to begin January 2012, creates a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, physical therapists and others to provide proactive care in the home for seniors with multiple chronic conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and congestive heart failure. As you know, there are more than 57 million Amerians living with multiple chronic illnesses in our country. These patients typically have numerous prescriptions written by an array of doctors, and struggle to visit their physicians when they need care. IAH aims to end the current disjointed approach of caring for these patients. Such successful programs that reduce costs and improve health care outcomes should be considered in the National Alzheimer's Plan and enacted across the country to support caregivers and increase access to quality care for all patients.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In addition, it is our hope that the National Alzheimer's Plan will call on federal agencies to work with state and local governments to increase Alzheimer's and dementia training for health care professionals, social workers, employees of long-term care facilities and law enforcement. Increased training and education could dramatically improve the treatment of Alzheimer's patients and help avoid unnecessary costs and harm as the result of wrongful diagnosis and mistreatment.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Encourage State Plans</strong></p>
<p>30 states currently have or are in the process of developing plans for supporting Alzheimer's patients.<sup>6</sup> The Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs, for example, established a committee of experts to evaluate services and resources available to Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers and develop a strategy for improving care. Their initial reports focused on the need to diagnose patients early, connect patients and their families to available resources, and facilitate at-home care.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease are too varied and far-reaching for the federal government to tackle alone. From improving transportation services for patients in rural neighborhoods to assisting in the creation of new adult daycare centers, state and local governments are well positioned to improve the day-to-day care of Alzheimer's patients. In order to fully support the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease and their families struggling to care for them, we need local and state governments involved in developing appropriate service models.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we hope the National Alzheimer's Plan will encourage states to assess the services they currently provide and develop plans for caring for the growing number of patients in the future. In addition, the National Alzheimer's Plan should look for ways the federal government can support or reward state efforts to improve and coordinate care, especially if states develop innovative solutions with measurable cost-savings or improvements in care.</p>
<p>Caring for the aging baby-boomers will be one of the greatest tests of our society. Today, over 5 millions Americans and their families are struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Unless we find a way to prevent, slow, or cure this disease, in less than one generation those struggles will nearly triple, as millions more Americans face the prospect of an Alzheimer's diagnosis. We must change our current trajectory. NAPA was intended to outline innovative and large-scale strategies for improving care for our senior citizens, to which we owe so much, and ultimately find a cure for this devastating disease. We encourage HHS and its partnering federal agencies to continue their diligent, timely, and thoughtful work to implement NAPA and draft this historic National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is writing to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in regards to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). SWHR has key scientific recommendations that it believes the Advisory Council should consider as it is establishing an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>SWHR, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research. SWHR appreciates the work NAPA is and will be doing to focus our nation's resources on Alzheimer's disease. While Alzheimer's disease is a disease of the brain, the brains of men and women are inherently different. It is common knowledge that men and women think differently; however, recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated that the difference goes beyond thought processes. Sex differences have been observed in the anatomy of the brain, behavioral traits, and in the physiological responses of the nervous system to outside stimuli and internal perturbation. These differences are also noted in the aging process and for the degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>SWHR believes that sex differences in Alzheimer's disease are critical to scientific advancements in diagnosing and treating the disease and need to be a part of the plan's scope. In October 2011, SWHR convened a one-day scientific roundtable of experts to discuss what is known about sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease, from both a basic and clinical science perspective as well as those of the caregiver and what research questions needed to be answered for progress to be made in the disease for all who are impacted. From the meeting it was clear that Alzheimer's disease research must account for sex as a basic biological variable and include sex-specific analyses and would be an extremely useful component of a national strategic plan to combat Alzheimer's disease. Key research recommendations from the roundtable that NAPA should include:</p>
<ul><li>Research on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's Disease, specifically examining sex differences in the transition from normality to early stages of disease to dementia, and from dementia to outcomes.</li>
<li>Research on the influence of sex steroids, bioenergetic vulnerabilities, synaptic function, and cognition in the brain as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Re-examination of existing data for potential sex differences to help define the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and publishing sex-specific results.</li>
<li>Research on the differential impact of the caregiving role on men and women and design interventions to provide more effective services</li>
</ul><p>Significant differences exist between men and women who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine, explained in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that "Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women: up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology, whereas it is found in only 8-10 percent of age-matched women." Abnormalities caused by Alzheimer's disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms or behavioral problems for men and women with the disease and may lead to the need for different treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>Biology of Sex Differences (BSD)</em> published research on sex differences of certain brain cells and their response to inflammation in the article, "Sex Differences in the Inflammatory Response of Primary Astrocytes to Lippolysaccharide" on July 12, 2011. Sex differences in incidence, age of onset, symptoms or outcome are evident in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Astrocytes, one of the glial cells of the brain, show sex difference in number of cells, function, and differentiation. Glial cells are involved with physical support for neurons, while others regulate the internal environment of the brain, and provide nutrients to neurons of the brain.</p>
<p>With the increasing number of known sex differences found in research in Alzheimer's disease, SWHR recommends gaining a better understanding of the relationship between pathology and how disease presentation affects men and women differently leading to future sex-specific therapies for the disease.</p>
<p>Through our research recommendations above, SWHR seeks to put before the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services the need to advance more targeted therapies in Alzheimer's disease for both men and women. This will lead to a greater understanding of risk factors for both men and women and more sex specific treatment of cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>Should the Advisory Council have any questions or would like more information please contact Eileen Resnick, Director of Scientific Programs at SWHR.</p>

<p>CAUSES AND PREVENTION CAN BE DISCLOSED WITH STATISTICS! I am an 84 year old woman and a member of a genetic-Alzheimer's family. In my lifetime I am aware of eight family members who have been victims of Alzheimer's, the last three in my generation. Like so many families, I have watched my mother and my sister slowly lose their identities to this tragedy.</p>
<p>In the 21 years since an autopsy specified my mother's AD, dementia-research has mostly consisted of the very limited success of pharmaceutical trials, and more recently, gene-testing. This tunnel-vision has resulted in many family's continuing tragedies.</p>
<p>Currently, researchers are seeking new ways to identify pre-symptomatic members of such genetic families. They are searching for methods to identify those at high-risk, who are not yet experiencing cognitive impairments, so as to test "preventive" medications or life-styles.</p>
<p><strong><em>There is no need of evaluating pre-clinical subjects, when critical diagnostic testing and histories already exist, or can be researched, for those who have already been diagnosed with dementia. </em></strong></p>
<p>Current testing is uncovering conditions that may be causing dementia; injuries, diet, diseases, pathologies, environment, without the additional knowledge of possible <strong><em>linkage to commonality!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>It is time to invest in a "National/International Registry" to uncover the comparative histories of millions of patients. A computerized dignostic framework and guiding terminology needs to be created, to organize a vital public-reference as an ongoing global study of all brain diseases. </em></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NAPA National Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Advocacy for the Rights and Interests of the Elderly (CARIE) is pleased to submit the following recommendations for inclusion in the NAPA National Plan. CARIE is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for frail older adults by working to protect their rights and promote awareness of their needs and concerns. Since 1977, CARIE has been providing advocacy services and options counseling for older adults and their caregivers. CARIE coordinates the Dorothy S. Washburn Legislative Committee comprised of legal, health and human services professionals as well as older adults who advocate to improve public policy impacting older adults and their caregivers.</p>
<p>CARIE is concerned about the issue of unbefriended elderly, more specifically, those with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia who do not have a caregiver or responsible party to help them. There have been problems with these older adults being prematurely admitted to nursing facilities or being denied in-home services because of concern about liability. CARIE requests that the NAPA National Plan begin to address the needs of this population. There should be a dialogue about how to best strike a balance between preserving autonomy and allowing consumers to take some risks versus ensuring safety through more protective measures. While there is an abundance of information about Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and support for caregivers, there is little, if any, information for those who do not have a caregiver or responsible party. There is enough anecdotal evidence to assume that not all older adults have family or close friends available to help.</p>
<p>CARIE's Dorothy S. Washburn Legislative Committee makes the following recommendations for the NAPA National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations </strong></p>
<ol><li>Include the issue and needs of unbefriended elderly in the NAPA National Plan and encourage the inclusion of the needs of this population in state plans.</li>
<li>Implement an epidemiological study to identify the scope of the problem.</li>
<li>Implement research to help identify best practices for ways to ensure early diagnosis for unbefriended elderly. Issues related to stigma and cultural differences should be addressed. Quality assessments should be readily available in all communities for consumers who are becoming concerned about symptoms.</li>
<li>Design and fund demonstration projects to identify best practices and practical, cost-effective models for service delivery. There should be a balance between consumers' safety and their need for autonomy. Different needs, preferences and values should be considered. Models should be tested among various cultural groups to identify potential variance with approaches. Identify benchmarks and performance measures that foster good outcomes.</li>
<li>Research, design and implement clinical tools to help assess the decision-making capacity of individuals and work to maximize autonomy and ensure individuals are engaged and involved in making decisions to the greatest extent possible.</li>
<li>Identify and utilize an ethical framework for assessment, planning and service delivery to ensure autonomy to the best extent possible as well as cultural considerations.</li>
<li>Identify best practices for health care professionals, social workers, and paraprofessionals needed to work with this population including competencies and knowledge needed.</li>
<li>Create training programs and help implement best practices for public safety officials such as police and fire fighters, emergency management personnel, and postal workers to help them identify those in need as well as where to turn for further assistance. Information should include but not be limited to what to do for someone who is found wandering.</li>
<li>Develop strategies to prevent financial exploitation and premature guardianships for those in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Ensure access to legal services.</li>
<li>Create, test, and implement model community educational programs to increase public awareness and decrease stigma.</li>

<p>The single most staggering dilemma facing our Nation today is the upcoming tsunami of "boomers" barreling down upon us that will become victims of Alzheimer's!</p>
<p>At this time, Right Now, visionary leadership is absolutely essential in order to effectively direct action that will lessen the hardship that will be experienced by millions so stricken as well as their loved ones. Decisive action towards implementing screening that will diagnose severity with appropriate treatment being scheduled at the time of screening.</p>
<p>While the emphasis remains on "The Cure" we cannot afford to lose sight of the here and now and the fact that today there are meds available that will lessen the impact of this mind-robbing malady and provide relief for friends and loved one of these individuals in the way of quality of life extensions. Early detection must be recognized as a priority concern.</p>
<p>Florida, with its huge Elder population, leads the Nation in this devastating and incurable disease. It is projected that in just a few years this amount may increase three fold. Now s the time for action/Further delays will be a reflection of an abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p>As a caregiver who has experienced first handthe horrific loss of individuality by those who have no control of this I stand firmly for immediate priority action to alleviate the suffering associated with Alzheimer's. As a civilized society we can do no less to insure the respect and dignity of these souls.</p>

<p>I have been conducting training for health care professionals for over 20 years, including physicians on Alzheimer's disease. It is a fact the thephysicians are not prepared to assess for symptoms of the disease nor able to cooperate with the community health and social agencies on coordinating services that are needed. There needs to be much more education at the basic level through the tele-health programs, especially in the rural areas, on basic skills in assessing for Alzheimer's</p>
<p>The other issue is the importance in establishing a base line for possible early signs of dementia -- i.e. MCI. About 80% of early assessments of MCI usually end up within 10 years or so being "diagnosed" as Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Suggestion is that a baseline, as one does for blood pressure, using a modified mini mental status test be made for the population starting at 50.</p>
<p>Redo it every year when visiting the doctors office -- and compare the changes. If there are changes then further investigation is needed with possibly early intervention using Aricept or Memantine. These have been shown to be effective together the earlier they are administered.</p>

<p>As you undertake this crucial work, please consider the nearly 14.9 million unpaid Alzheimer's caregivers, many of whom are overwhelmed by their caregiving role. This number will grow year by year as will the number of those diagnosed with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>In more than 20 readings and discussions which I have conducted this year, I inevitably find a thirst among caregivers for honest, lived, true stories of caregiving. Tonight I will address this issue at a meeting in St. Louis. The issue was framed for me this way: What happens when you have to parent your parents? How do the parents react who are now in the role of care recipient? The FAQs from my meetings represent a document of the profound and thoughtful concerns of audiences from Michigan to Washington state to Missouri. I urge you to consider this aspect of the Alzheimer's "dilemma."</p>
<p>The literature of lived Alzheimer's experiences is invaluable as a tool for caregivers. It complements the excellent medical and advice literature in its human and humane perspective. Please consider its role as part of an outreach to the millions of caregivers who feel as if they are swimming solo in their duties.</p>

<p>While a large number of researchers are focused on using new imaging techniques to diagnose this disease earlier, I find in my practice that many people who have had this disease for years are going undiagnosed. I believe that this is because primary care physicians are intimidated by this diagnosis and many psychiatrist and neurologists just not interested in making this diagnosis.

<p style="text-align:center">Comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					September 27, 2011</p>
<p style="text-align:center">By Matthew P. Janicki, Ph.D. on behalf of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices</p>
<p>I am the co-chair, along with Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry, of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. The National Task Group was created in 2010 by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD), and my university center, the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging and Developmental Disabilities (Lifespan Health and Function) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Our charge was to examine the state of practices related to dementia and people with lifelong intellectual disabilities, their families and caregivers, and the organizations that support them, and provide commentary on what needs to be done to further services and practices in the United States related to this population. Our charge also was to provide information and recommendations to the Advisory Council formed under the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>To this end, the National Task Group, composed of some 100 administrators, academics, providers, clinicians, families, and advocates, have coalesced with a number of national disability and family based organizations, federal agencies, and provider representatives to create a report on our findings and recommendations. The report, "'<em>My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected By Dementia to Remain In Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em> " is currently in development and we anticipate having it launched at our next National Task Group meeting in November.</p>
<p>In advance of the release of our Report, it is timely to provide the Advisory Council with some key points from the Report for its use. We have prepared these comments, which I trust the Council members will find informative and helpful:</p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affects adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in similar ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound impact due to particular risk factors -- including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. While mostly the disease follows a typical course, at times some adults are profoundly and aggressively affected. Yet all need the typical types of supports and services usually associated with dementia-capable care. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- believe that adults with intellectual disabilities require the same early and periodic diagnostic services, community education, and community-based supports for themselves, their caregivers, and the organizations responsible for them, as do other adults with dementia in the general population</em>.</li>
<li>Many families are the primary lifetime caregivers for adults with intellectual disabilities and when Alzheimer's disease and dementia occurs, they are particularly affected and need considerable supports. These families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. Many such families are at a loss for providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes progressive and care demands overwhelm them. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased home-based supports for caregivers who remain the primaries for care for adults affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Many intellectual disabilities provider organizations that are the primary resources for residential and day supports are vexed by the emerging trend of increasing numbers of adults with intellectual disabilities in their services showing signs of early decline and dementia with potentially more demanding care needs. In such cases, staff may be unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and may misrepresent or ignore these changes, when early identification could prove beneficial. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased education and training of personnel with respect to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and invest in promoting best practices in models of community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>As it is important to pick up signs of dementia-related cognitive decline early on , we -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and health authorities undertake a program of early identification screening - beginning at age 50 for adults with intellectual disabilities and at age 40 for adults with Down syndrome and others at early risk. We recognize that the Advisory Council may be debating the issue of early identification and screening in the general population. In this regard, <em>the National Task Group</em> has identified a screening instrument, applicable particularly to adults with an intellectual disability, which seems to work as a first-instance screen and <em>recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to begin to identify those adults at risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Most adults with a lifelong intellectual disability live in community settings with support from families, friends and service providers. Research has shown that community-based models of care for adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia include community-based options, such as support for living at home or in small group homes, are viable and gaining preference for all individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. Institutionalization of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia is anathema to the core beliefs and commitments to care practices in the intellectual disabilities field and such institutionalization (via use of long-term care facilities) has been shown to have an adverse affect on lifespan and quality of life. The group home model, where a handful of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia live in a specialized care home, is becoming more prominent across the world. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that these models be expanded and an investment be made into enabling provider organizations to develop and maintain such care efforts, including developing more small community-based specialized 'dementia capable' group homes</em>.</li>
<li>Dementia has a devastating impact on all people one way or another -- including people with intellectual disabilities and the many families, friends, and staff involved as parents, siblings, advocates, and caregivers. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- wish to give emphasis to this point and ask the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to include concerns and considerations for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities in any and all documents, plans, and recommendations to Congress that are part of the work of the Council</em>. The National Task Group stands ready to assist and contribute to such efforts and is pleased that this Council recognizes Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as an ultimate public health issue and a problem to which we collectively need to attend.</li>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to give suggestions regarding areas for inclusion into the National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease. I am a Board Certified Family Nurse Practitioner working in a Primary Care Internal Medicine practice and also the daughter of a person with Alzheimer's (late stage, diagnosed in 2000 with symptoms for at least 3 years prior to diagnosis).</p>
<ul><li>
<p>I would like to see changes in the current care delivery when it is not possible for people affected by the disease to be primarily cared for by family members in their private homes. I believe the current wide spread choices of secured Assisted Living facilities or Long term Intermediate Care in Nursing Facilities are not the best solutions and we need to do a major overhaul in our traditional way of thinking about this type of housing and care. It is not cost effective and certainly does not result in high levels of satisfaction among persons with the disease or their loved ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly I believe it is a travesty that we have allowed the federal funding of this illness to be so grossly inadequate that we have no significant answers about how we can prevent this illness and no hope of being able to offer treatments that will change the course of this disease. This illness is sapping a huge amount of funding from federal, state and private resources and yet our legislators can't commit to setting aside more than a pittance as compared to funding for other major illnesses. Please imagine the devastation of being diagnosed with AD and having no hope for cure or even remission of symptoms for any period of time but knowing the illness is progressive and fatal. When you look at the history of how concentrated and dedicated effort to research and development changed the outlook for those with HIV/AIDS you have to believe it IS possible to change how a person diagnosed with Alzheimer's could expect the rest of their life to unfold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this time of advanced electronic communication we should be able to conduct research without burdening people and their families with the need to travel long distances to be seen in major research centers. With the use of (and low intensity training of) qualified people in areas remote to research centers patients could easily undergo periodic evaluations and assessments using tools such as Skype and other Internet communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to involve mass media resources such as newspapers, television and e-communications to inform and update the public of the realities of Alzheimer's. There has been too long a stigma attached to this illness that keeps even intelligent and otherwise forward thinking people and families from allowing any common knowledge of being diagnosed or affected with the illness. These same people would not hesitate to inform others if they were diagnosed with cancer or heart disease but act as if the diagnosis of Alzheimer's is shameful or an indicator of a personality weakness. It is time for AD to come "out of the closet"!</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for the work you are undertaking and for being dedicated to providing real change for those Americans affected by Alzheimer's either personally or by witness of the illness with anger, sadness and hopelessness. We MUST change the impact of this disease for the millions of Americans who live it daily.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's has a very simple and avoidable cause: steam-refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils. I have been working this out since 1990.</p>
<p>The unsuspected vitamin E deficiency in these widely consumed food oils leads to brain cell membrane oxidation, that impairs the function of important enzymes that normally degrade the beta-amyloid protein. This protein therefore accumulates, incredibly slowly, in the brain of a regular consumer of deodorized vegetable seed oils.</p>
<p>After the age of 65 or so, accumulated beta-amyloidmay release highly toxic soluble aggregates (called oligomers), that are the immediate cause of synaptic toxicity and neuronal death.</p>
<p>That is exactly how over 5 million Americans have ended up with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>My suggestion to your Government, is simply to legislate a requirement for all refined seed oils in your country to have any vitamin E deficit (usually 30%) corrected before distribution and sale. This simple step will also prevent ADHD occurring during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Already, this basic preventive step is under consideration by the Australian Government's Food Standards Authority, and we may be the first nation in the world to eliminate the twin brain epidemics of Alzheimer's and its prenatal partner, ADHD.</p>
<p>The USA--where vacuum steam-refining of seed oils was invented, in 1899 (David Wesson, Savannah)--has no shortage of brain power. What you lack is a safe level of vitamin E in your brain-oxidizing vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Can you fix the problem, and catch up with Australia?</p>
<p>When your Norfolk, Virginia shipyards were mass-producing Liberty ships for WW2 Atlantic convoys, a large banner was hung across the docks, saying:</p>
<p>IT CAN AND WILL BE DONE!!</p>
<p>Can you make vegetable oils safe? Can you do this too?</p>
<p>I attach a draft hypothesis for your inspection: I shall be trimming it down shortly, for submission to The Lancet, in London.</p>
<p>Here, at long last, is the direct cause of the disease: knowing this, we can easily prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease And Attention Deficit Disorder May Share A Single Cause: Refined Vegetable Oil</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>By Dr Robert Peers, General Practitioner, North Carlton, MELBOURNE</strong></p>
<p>In 1990 I identified a potential cause of typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), reporting my findings (a small case/control study) in a letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal [Ref 1] in 1993 (letter: "Alzheimer's Disease And Vegetable Oils"). I found that 12 cases of diagnosed AD had all consumed refined polyunsaturated seed oils for many years, contrasting with 20 age-matched control subjects with good memories, none of whom used such oils.</p>
<p>The reason for seeking a dietary cause was simple and compelling: AD had been seen to sometimes affect only one of a pair of identical twins [Ref 2], a striking finding that points strongly to some toxic or dietary cause. In addition, it was very unlikely to be caused by ageing itself, since the other twin was the same age, but remained unaffected in the long term; and because most older people do not in fact get the disease. I reasoned that those who were affected were somehow getting it from their diet, but how?</p>
<p>My initial reading even disclosed a likely dietary suspect: Professor Scott Henderson, an Australian research psychiatrist, cites in his 1988 AD review/hypothesis paper [Ref 3] a remarkable study [Ref 4] done by Professor Denham Harman in 1976, in Nebraska. Harman had a free radical theory of ageing, and knowing that both seed oils and the brain are rich in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids, he wondered whether feeding safflower oil to his rats might cause free radical damage to the brain: it certainly did, as his rats soon lost their way in a maze. Furthermore, giving vitamin E to a new group of rats, fed the same oil, prevented these cognitive deficits--a finding that suggests that his oil, and perhaps other seed oils too, were low in vitamin E.</p>
<p>This work made me very curious about common vegetable seed oils, which were well known to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk, but nobody had previously suspected them of actually causing a disease, and here they were evidently oxidizing the brain!</p>
<p>Soon after setting out on my library search for a dietary factor in 1990, I discovered that deodorized seed oils lose about a third of their antioxidant vitamin E during refining [Ref 5]--a potentially serious deficiency not seen in the soft margarines made from the same oils, which suffer polyunsaturate losses during hydrogenation, restoring the vitamin E/polyunsaturate balance. I realized immediately how important this deficiency would be in the brain, whose nerve cell membranes are very rich in highly oxidizable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Since the main function of vitamin E is to protect these vulnerable essential fatty acids against oxidation, a low level of vitamin E in the nerve cell membrane would invite cerebral "lipid peroxidation". Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids breaks up the fatty acid chain, and among the fragments are neurotoxic aldehyde molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidized Omega-6 fatty acids, in particular, release the highly reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), whose toxic effects on nerve synapses may account for the faulty memory seen in "Seed Oil Syndrome", described below. But 4-HNE does more than that: it activates a key enzyme involved in AD development, and may also--more importantly--mediate the impaired beta-amyloid clearance caused by cerebral lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Elena Tamagno, in Turin, has shown [Ref 6], in recent years, that 4- HNE indirectly activates the pivotal AD enzyme beta-secretase (BACE 1), a small rise in the activity of which causes a sharp increase in betaamyloid formation [S Cole, Ref 7]. Beta-amyloid is a peptide--a small protein fragment--that is the molecular cause of AD, as in rare genetic cases, where a gene mutation increases the production of a more toxic form of this peptide (the longer form, with 42 aminoacids, rather than the 40 residues seen in the much less toxic and more abundant form).</p>
<p>Although small amounts of this important protein fragment are produced in the normal brain, it is easily cleared away by degrading enzymes, and it can also exit the brain through the blood-brain barrier. However, people consuming refined vegetable oil will be forming increased beta-amyloid in abnormal oxidizing conditions, that may damage the clearance mechanism, resulting in progressive betapeptide accumulation and, ultimately, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One possibility is that lipid peroxidation products, like the same 4-HNE, might inhibit a key clearance enzyme, called Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (which also degrades beta-amyloid). In fact, an amyloid clearance problem is all that is required to cause AD, since even a mild over-production of beta-amyloid--as I postulate above--may still be successfully cleared.</p>
<p>So my theory does require a clearance defect, whether or not amyloid production is increased. And now, in 2009, Dr Y Nishida in Japan has shown [Ref 8] that by blocking vitamin E transport to mouse brain, lipid membrane peroxidation ensues, which impairs beta-amyloid clearance, by somehow reducing the expression of the gene coding for the above Insulin-Degrading Enzyme. Vitamin E-depleted seed oils, likewise, lower vitamin E levels in most tissues, causing lipid peroxidation [Y H Wang, Ref 9], which must include the brain, as shown by the early cognitive deficits seen in Harman's pioneering work (above), and their notable prevention with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Common Omega-6 seed oils, which are usually steam-deodorized, have been linked to cognitive decline in Holland [S Kalmijn, Ref 10], and also in Greece [D Psaltopoulou, Ref 11]), and to over double the risk of incident dementia (70% being AD) in the prospective "Three Cities Study" in France [P Barberger-Gateau, Ref 12]. Processed safflower oil, as discussed above, was shown many years ago (1976!) to cause memory faults in rats, which could be prevented with vitamin E. For some reason, Dr Harman did not alert the US food safety authorities to this alarming discovery.</p>
<p>Low vitamin E levels in corn, soya and safflower oils were first demonstrated by Dr David Herting in Rochester, New York State (Ref 5--see "herting d and 1963" on <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>, to find and download his free Journal of Nutrition paper). He concluded that widespread vitamin E deficiency would occur in populations consuming processed polyunsaturated seed oils. However, he did not realize the extreme peroxidation vulnerability of the brain and retina, where reduced vitamin E levels mean rapid lipid peroxidation of long-chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, in synapses and in retinal rod cell disc membranes. Had he known this, he could have predicted a new disease of the brain, with the further possibility of a new childhood brain disorder, arising in the fetal brain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It was precisely these most vulnerable tissues that were tragically ignored in the landmark nutritional study, completed in 1960 in Illinois, on which current recommended daily intake of vitamin E is based [Ref 13]. Although lead investigator Dr Max Horwitt should have been aware of the brain's rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mentioned, for example, in 1950s biochemistry texts), he judged vitamin E requirement exclusively by testing the fragility of red blood cell membranes in vitamin E-deprived human subjects, finding even greater fragility when the subjects were given vitamin E-stripped corn oil.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Horwitt to ask his vitamin E-deprived subjects about higher mental functions like memory or mood. Memory difficulties (and glare sensitivity and night-blindness from retinal damage) are likely to occur long before the red cell test becomes positive in response to gradual dietary vitamin E depletion, because the oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are much less concentrated in the red cell membrane, than in retina and brain. Lipid peroxidation is a very rapid chain-reaction, that proceeds much faster in a vitamin E-depleted cell membrane containing a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when those fatty acids--as in brain and retina--are of the long-chain variety, full of oxidizable double bonds.</p>
<p>To his credit, Horwitt did realize that the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids, so he based the recommended daily intake on the ratio of vitamin E to the intake of these fatty acids. He assumed that higher polyunsaturate intake, for example seed oil, would automatically mean higher vitamin E intake, but neglected the possibility that processed seed oils might lose some of this vitamin E during refining, and so cause some new disease specifically involving tissues prone to lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Indeed, he failed to pursue this possibility, even when he found that some members of staff at the Elgin Mental Hospital, who were not on the vitamin E deficient test diet, also had an abnormal red cell test. He did not ask himself how that could have happened, but could have taken a dietary history, and might have discovered that they were consumers of common vegetable oils, which could therefore have had something in common with his experimental stripped corn oil: low content of vitamin E. He may then have gone on to investigate the vitamin E content of such oils, and found it to be low--as David Herting found three years later, in 1963. Had Horwitt detected mild memory faults in consumers of refined seed oils, and set himself to do a little thinking, he could have nipped Alzheimer's in the bud, in 1960.</p>
<p>Any child, young person or adult consuming refined seed oils will report, if asked, memory problems, poor dark adaptation and glare sensitivity (photophobia--which is irreversible). I discovered this syndrome in general practice, and I call it Seed Oil Syndrome, and it probably reflects 4-HNE neurotoxicity in the synapses. Lipid peroxidation, which in the long term causes impaired beta-amyloid clearance, has early clinical effects due to synaptic damage: 4-HNE impairs neuronal glucose uptake, among other effects.</p>
<p>I have seen this hitherto undescribed syndrome in 100s of oil-using patients in family practice, over many years. The memory responds well to vitamin E (I sometimes add fish oil, for a faster response), except after the age of 50 or so, when subjects report long-term stability of memory, without actual improvement.</p>
<p>I am hoping that these cases, who, after some 20-30 years of refined oil exposure, may have a significant brain amyloid load, will not progress to AD, once off seed oils, and using olive oil, vitamin E and fish oil supplement. I also have some of them on Inositol, a seed sugar known to neutralize toxic Abeta oligomers [Ref 14] and improve language and orientation in established AD [Ref 15].</p>
<p>This simple glucose isomer, which is easily obtained in the diet (from grains, nuts, legumes, soymilk, cantaloupe and citrus), may prove to be a powerful weapon--along with cessation of refined-oil exposure-- in preventing Seed Oil Syndrome progressing slowly to Mild Cognitive Impairment and, ultimately, diagnosed AD. Given the extensive neuronal damage already evident in these two later stages, ultra-early prevention is now thought to be the only way to stop this disease, and nutrition--if it can do the job--is far preferable to preventive drugs.</p>
<p>From the public health angle, all cases of Seed Oil Syndrome--which is easily identified by symptoms and diet history--should change to olive oil (or any cold-pressed oil), eat a high.Inositol diet (even citrus juice is very rich in Inositol), and preferably take fish-oil capsules as well.</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake from butter, cream, cheese, fatty meat, pastries etc., must also be reduced, for it commonly causes co-morbid vascular dementia in the Alzheimer victim.</p>
<p>Inositol, given as a higher dose (5 gm/day) via supplement, also reverses anxiety disorder and depression [Ref 16], which affect perhaps 40% of AD cases. Anxiety alone doubles the risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD [Ref 17], possibly because of cortisol-induced hippocampal damage, low Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels and poor hippocampal neurogenesis. Depression, often resulting from anxiety plus fatty diet, may increase inflammation--pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1-beta may aggravate neuronal damage and increase stress axis activation even further. Anti-anxiety doses of Inositol also have a place here, by greatly decreasing stress-induced comfort-eating of fatty foods like chocolate, cheese, cakes and pastries [author's clinical observations].</p>
<p>One extra benefit from Inositol in brain disease is its unexpected antiageing effect [Ref 18], a possible example of which is the NIH 31 grain-rich mouse diet, that prolongs the median lifespan of female mice by 25% [Ref 19]. By altering the same genes that are altered by caloric restriction--including the key mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC 1 alpha--Inositol is clearly a caloric restriction mimetic, with the same potential as dietary restriction to provide neurotrophic, antioxidant and energizing benefits in brain, as described by nutritional neuroscientist Mark Mattson [Ref 20]. Already, a multiple sclerosis animal model has been found to respond well to caloric restriction [Ref 21]: Inositol is a more practical intervention.</p>
<p>Variations in AD incidence around the world (low in West Africa, very high in Wadi Ara Arabs in Israel, 4 times higher in Pittsburgh than in Ballabgarh, Northern India) probably reflect local patterns of refined seed oil consumption. In Northern India, unrefined traditional oils are still very popular (eg. pungent mustard oil, crude peanut oil), and in the South there is mostly coconut oil and crude peanut oil--and possibly an even lower AD rate.</p>
<p>Refined oils are, however, encroaching on these traditional markets. Palm oil is the main cooking oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, where AD rates may be low, but in the US and Europe--and the Middle East too-- refined oils are the rule, apart from those people lucky enough to still use mainly olive oil. A study in Bari, Italy, some years ago, showed cognitive decline in older subjects not using olive oil [Ref 22]; they were apparently using common refined supermarket seed oils, which are widely used in Italy for frying.</p>
<p>An oil that causes a serious brain disease in adult life might also be expected to affect the fetal brain: when asking many oil-using patients about symptoms of Seed Oil Syndrome, I have noticed--as a family doctor--that young adults with the syndrome frequently have children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I proceeded to do a pilot case/control study on retrospective pregnancy diet, in 80 cases versus 80 controls.</p>
<p>Almost all (78) of the mothers of ADHD cases gave a history of regular consumption of refined seed oils during all or part of the pregnancy, often from fried takeaway food. All of these mothers had permanent glare sensitivity (most carried sunglasses, usually perched conveniently on their head), and those who still consumed these oils had ongoing memory difficulties and impaired night vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have met young adults with residual ADHD, who report that their mother, if still using such oils, and now in her mid- to lateforties, has an obvious memory problem. The Scottish breath-analysis scientist Brian Ross has found evidence of lipid peroxidation (increased breath ethane gas) in some children with ADHD [Ref 23], probably due to ongoing childhood exposure to the same refined seed oils that caused their condition during gestation.</p>
<p>In my child patients, such further exposure significantly worsens the ADHD, by increasing cognitive problems, mood issues, aggression and impulsivity--all of which improve rapidly by stopping the exposure and recommending fish oil, to assist synaptic recovery and plasticity. Not only does fish oil work faster when refined oils are first excluded from the diet (to prevent peroxidative destruction of the fish oil fatty acids in vitamin E-depleted synapses), but the synaptic benefits of fish oil may be greatly enhanced by adding two more "synaptic building blocksh--uridine and choline--as proposed for Alzheimer's, by nutritional neuroscientist Dr Richard Wurtman, at the Massachusets Institute of Technology [Ref 24]. Uridine sources include brewer's yeast, broccoli and beetroot, while choline is found in egg, chicken, lecithin and wheat germ. Wurtman's "Souvenaid" synapse-restoring mixture, which increases synaptic density and cognitive function in gerbil rats, does improve Alzheimer symptoms, and may work even better in the developing ADHD brain of a young child, to the extent that usual medications for the latter disorder may become obsolete, due to advances in brain nutrition.</p>
<p>I believe there is enough evidence available to conclude that deodorized seed oils are a major public health hazard, being directly responsible for ADHD, widespread Seed Oil Syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. I notice in my clinic that Seed Oil Syndrome causes depression and irritability in anxious subjects, and aggravates ADHD in children and adolescents, promoting delinquency, serious aggression, antisocial behaviour, and substance abuse. These problems are now endemic in Western cities, and increasing world-wide.</p>
<p>Correction of all such brain peroxidation problems is very simple: to protect their citizens, while at the same time keeping these heartfriendly oils available, governments must be persuaded to pass laws requiring that all deodorized seed oils be rendered safe, with respect to their vitamin E content, before being sold. Natural vitamin E can 8 easily be recovered from the steam distillate at the food oil refinery, and replaced in the deodorized oil: or synthetic vitamin E could be used instead. Urgent action is required.</p>
<p>The highly desirable result of fixing this seed oil catastrophe would be to eliminate the twin epidemics of Alzheimer's and ADHD, along with the alarming antisocial effects of refined seed oils, as specified above.</p>

<p>I am a retired public school principal (age 64) and a caregiver for my wife (age 65), who has Alzheimer's Disease (AD). I have written two articles that have recently been published in <em>American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Other Dementias</em>. "Alzheimer's and Baby Boomers" was published in their September, 2010 issue, and "Ten Things You Should Do When the Diagnosis is Alzheimer's" appeared in their March, 2011 issue. I also had a third article published, "Forget the Mental Status Test and Learn to Listen," as a lengthy Letter to the Editor in the May issue of <em>Journal of Family Practice</em>. These three articles were written to help doctors improve their process of diagnosis and treatment of AD patients ... and their caregivers ... based upon my experience to date. I am now writing a fourth article to educate the public on the urgent need to increase federal funding though NIH for research. I have appended a draft of that piece to the end of this email.</p>
<p>I respectfully request that your Advisory Council address the issues raised in my three articles, as well as in the attached draft. Aside from the need to increase AD research funding,</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's ... Our New Cancer?</strong><br />
					Allan Vann</p>
<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in this country. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control reported that between 1971-2007, the number of cancer survivors in the United States grew tremendously due to "earlier detection, improved diagnostic methods, and more effective treatment," among other reasons. Furthermore, according to CDC, "about 1.1 million of the (cancer) survivors had lived with the diagnosis for more than 25 years."</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the sixth leading <em>and fastest growing</em> cause of death in this country, and the <em>only</em>one of the top ten causes with <em>no means of prevention or cure</em>. Unlike with cancer, CDC cannot report <em>any </em>AD survivors. <em>None</em>. Most people only live for 8-10 years after an AD diagnosis, and between 5-10% of those with Alzheimer's are still in their thirties, forties, and fifties when diagnosed.</p>
<p>Our country faces a huge AD crisis in the years ahead. More than 5 million Americans have already been diagnosed with AD, and with so many baby boomers now turning 65 each day this number is expected to triple in the next 30-40 years.</p>
<p>One politician seeking greater funding for AD research is Maine Senator Susan Collins. She noted that, "We spend one penny on research for every dollar the federal government spends on care for patients with Alzheimer's. That just doesn't make any sense." Care for Alzheimer's patients already costs this country nearly $200 billion a year and, according to Senator Collins, "If nothing is done to slow or stop the disease, Alzheimer's will cost the United States $20 trillion over the next 40 years."</p>
<p>This year, our National Institutes of Health (NIH) will allocate <em>more than $6 <strong>billion</strong></em> for cancer research ... but <em>less than $500 <strong>million</strong></em> for AD research ... just as was true last year. This doesn't make any sense. Despite the need to reduce overall federal spending, we must increase NIH funding for AD research. Aside from the human cost to AD patients, caregivers, and their families, current research spending is penny wise and dollar foolish. As Senator Collins suggested, without major breakthroughs in treating AD, let alone finding a cure, future long term costs to our Medicare system will be astronomical.</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with AD at age 63. No treatment or cure will arrive in time for her. But if our country begins to devote funding for AD research as we have for cancer, then perhaps one day some people will be able to say that they are AD survivors. And perhaps our health care system will be that much further away from bankruptcy.</p>
