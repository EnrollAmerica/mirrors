<p>I am Matthew Janicki. Along with my colleague, Dr. Seth M. Keller, we are the Co-Chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices -- the "NTG". The NTG is a national group affiliated with the American Academy on Developmental Medicine and Dentistry and the University of Illinois's Center on Developmental Disabilities and Health. We are a membership organization supported by a range of formal and informal organizations and are made up of more than 250 members -- representing a broad range of interests focusing on advocating for solutions to issues faced by adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia -- and their families and formal caregivers. The mission of the NTG is multifaceted:</p>
<ul><li>Promote adoption of a specialized screening instrument and process.</li>
<li>Define ways to assess 'cognitive impairment' as part of the annual wellness visit requirement under the Affordable Care Act.</li>
<li>Develop practice guidelines for health and social care practitioners.</li>
<li>Promote 'best practice' service models and systems of care that meet the unique needs of individuals with disabilities and their caregivers.</li>
<li>Aid families by providing information and aids for coping with dementia and its challenges.</li>
<li>Assist in adoptions of standards of care.</li>
<li>Institute public education and training programs.</li>
<li>Collaborate with national and regional organizations in public education, legislative and services development campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>The NTG also has been working in concert with the activities emanating from the <em>National Alzheimer's Project Act</em> (NAPA) to <strong>raise awareness within the context of NAPA of the needs of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia, and their families and other caregivers</strong>. Over the past five years we have watched the Council address a number of issues affecting people with dementia in general, and have been pleased by the actions cited in the Plan related to intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We appreciate the work of the Advisory Council and welcome those of you who are new members and trust you will help address the continued mission of the Council and its work as per the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. With this in mind we would like you to know why focal consideration needs to be given to people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<ul><li>Even as most adults with intellectual disabilities are affected by forms of dementia at the same rate as other adults, adults with Down syndrome are at extreme high risk for dementia and most show early onset and compromised longevity.</li>
<li>Early identification of signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and dementia among adults with intellectual disability is an important first step in managing the course of the disease and providing quality care -- but typical assessment and diagnostic measures are not appropriate for this population due to variability of cognitive abilities.</li>
<li>Many organizations providing community supports are still unprepared to adapt their care practices for older adults who are experiencing decline due to dementia and are in great need of technical assistance and access to creative models of community care.</li>
<li>A large number of older-aged adults with intellectual disabilities live with their families and dementia-related impairments increase the challenges for, and oftentimes overwhelm the capacities of, older caregivers.</li>
<li>An emerging model of dementia-capable' out-of-home care is the use of small community-based group homes and more technical assistance is needed to help providers adapt their care practices to make optimal use of this model.</li>
<li>Supportive education, training, and services can help caregivers minimize fatigue and prevent burnout, and help maintain affected older adults in community settings, but more coordinative and specialized education and training is needed.</li>
<li>Collaborative efforts at the local level, among disability, aging, and health providers can be effective in adapting services and supports to aid adults affected by dementia, as well as their caregivers -- and more emphasis on such collaboration is needed at the state and local level.</li>
<li>With appropriate services, adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia can continue to have quality lives in community settings and because of the presence of such settings the unnecessary institutionalization of older adults simply because dementia is present can be avoided.</li>
</ul><p>In today's remarks, on behalf of Dr. Keller, myself, and the NTG, we would like to offer our appreciation to the Council and its federal partners in their on-going efforts in recognizing the special needs of aging adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia and responding to the issues we have raised over the past five years. We are particularly appreciative of the results of the current series of awards by the Administration on Community Living for the Alzheimer's Disease Initiative grants and the special consideration given to intellectual disabilities, and to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for its multiple awards under the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) and its willingness to draw from the NTG's national education curriculum on dementia and intellectual disabilities so as to assure that issues related to intellectual disabilities will be covered in the education and training to be undertaken by the awardees. We are also very appreciative of the National Institute of Health (NIH) for its efforts to seek out solutions leading to the early identification of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities via the funding of two major multi-site studies designed to identify biomarkers among adults with Down syndrome, as well as support other dementia-related research among persons with lifelong disabilities.</p>
<p>Lastly, the NTG would like to offer its support to the pending proposal to establish a dementia-related caregiving summit among the federal partners and non-governmental organizations, and looks forward to the inclusion of issues facing caregivers of aging people with intellectual disabilities affected by early, mid-stage, and advanced dementia.</p>
<p>We thank the Chair for this opportunity to address the Council and look forward to continued fruitful collaborative endeavors designed to achieve the goals of the National Plan by 2025.</p>

<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 77 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me.</p>
<p>Congratulations and best wishes to the newly appointed members of the Advisory Council. We look forward to you building on the strong legacy of your predecessors, forging even more productive bonds with your colleagues, and being the catalysts for truly transformational progress in the quality of life for people facing dementia and the scientific pursuit of a world without dementia.</p>
<p>For the past several years, I have said during the public comment portion of Advisory Council meetings that the National Plan needed to match the aspirational and transformative 2025 goal for biomedical progress with similarly aspirational and transformative goals for clinical care and long term services and supports. At the Advisory Council's July 27 meeting, that conviction appeared to have sunk in with quite a few of the Council members. In particular, I want to thank Laurel Coleman and Harry Johns for their expressions not only of exasperation but of determination that this Advisory Council, this National Plan, and this country must achieve vast improvements in quality of life for those living with dementia and for their families.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'll offer a sample of a dozen actions that might help the Advisory Council get started (I'll be happy to flesh out any of these points):</p>
<ul><li>Because the National Plan should be about person-centered progress that improves lives, not about issuing reports, holding events, and delivering units of training or service: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for lowering rates (among people with dementia and their caregivers) of isolation; neglect, abuse, and exploitation; falls; wandering; premature institutional placement; depression; pain; impoverishment; and inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in home and community-based care settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Because transformative innovation requires multi-sector collaboration, strong coordination, and a purposeful confluence of priority-setting, resource commitment, and accountability: <strong>recommend that the National Plan include creation of a dementia care a services parallel to the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (being led by NIH in the biomedical research sphere)</strong>.</li>
<li>Because people living with dementia and family caregivers should have an easier time participating in and contributing to the Advisory Council process ("Nothing About Us Without Us"): <strong>the Advisory Council should conduct regularly scheduled public listening sessions in-person around the country or at least by web-conference and social media (e.g. Google Hangouts, Twitter Chats); add a "Comments" form to its ASPE website; add to each workgroup additional members (non-voting, if statutorily necessary) who are living with dementia or are caregivers; and consult with disabilities experts about other accommodations that would facilitate greater access and participation</strong>.</li>
<li>Because there is dignity in knowing your diagnosis and because diagnosis is the door to quality care, self-determination, and advancing social and biomedical research: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for rates of accurate, timely, and actionable diagnosis</strong>.</li>
<li>Because this is a national plan -- not a federal plan -- and quality of life issues are in no small measure defined by state and local policies and practices: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the National Governors Association, the National Council of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities to determine their capacity, interests, and best-practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because, by statute and by common sense, Congress is a stakeholder in the NAPA process: <strong>work with the relevant congressional committees, the House and Senate Alzheimer's Task Forces, the congressional caregiver caucus, and the congressional neuroscience caucus to more deeply engage them in the advisory council's work whether by attending meetings, appearing as guest presenters, or simply making sure they receive meeting agendas, announcements and links to materials and meeting videos</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia is an enormous and under-addressed workplace challenge both for employers and employees: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Society of Human Resource Managers, and representatives of both the business and labor communities to quantify those challenges and identify best-practices to change outcomes</strong>.</li>
<li>Because most people living with dementia and their caregivers have additional health challenges: <strong>actively engage public and private stakeholders focused on commonly co-occurring medical conditions -- such as diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, mental health disorders, hearing loss, and mobility loss -- to participate in the NAPA process of developing recommendations and action plans to improve quality of life</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does note respect state borders: <strong>help states not only to share best-practices but also to form inter-state collaborations to address the needs of people living with dementia and their families who cross those state borders for services and for reasons of shared family caregiving</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does not respect international borders either in its challenges or its solutions: <strong>formalize the National Plan goals and objectives with milestones and metrics about fostering international collaboration on research investments and priorities, regulatory harmonization, and translation and scaling of clinical and care practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because living with dementia and caregiving for people with dementia is hard enough under normal circumstances but far more difficult during, or in the wake of, natural disasters: <strong>encourage the Federal Emergency Management Agency to participate in the NAPA Process to help develop recommendations and action plans to meet the ongoing and emerging needs of individuals, families, and institutions</strong>.</li>
<li>Because the Advisory Council is a bully pulpit: <strong>be vocal, candid, and relentless is pressing Congress to end sequestration and lift the budget caps that do very real harm to millions of people living with dementia today and in the future</strong>.</li>
</ul><p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and I offer my thanks to others making public comments addressing such omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Good afternoon and thank you for your time today. My name is Grace Whiting and I am the Director of Strategic Partnerships at the National Alliance for Caregiving. The Alliance is a national non-profit organization dedicated to the mission of advancing family caregiving through research, innovation, and advocacy. By way of introduction to the new members of this body, we have over 40 national and multinational organizations in our membership, including four federal agencies and both not-for-profit and corporate organizations.</p>
<p>Together, we firmly believe that if our society is to rely on family caregivers to provide long-term care, then it is our duty to provide support for family caregivers -- at home, within models of healthcare delivery, in the workplace, and in the workplace. To that end, there are three comments I'd like to make today.</p>
<p>First, I would encourage you to consider international perspectives through your work on this council. As Secretariat of the International Alliance of CarerOrganizations, the Alliance often learns about new models of support for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias. These models offer insight into how we can better support families in the United States who are managing this terrible disease.</p>
<p>For example, Scotland's "Focus on Dementia" model provides a meaningful framework for integrating a diagnosis for dementia into care and support. The Focus on Dementia model creates a "hub" for the patient and family to navigate the challenges of the disease. The hub has eight domains, including: a Dementia Practice Coordinator; therapeutic interventions; general health care; mental health care; environmental adaptations; community connections and engagement; personalized support; and support for caregivers. Diagnosis operates as a touchpoint to refer the individual with dementia to the Dementia Practice Coordinator, and it allows both that individual and their caregiver to become eligible for services. As many of these services are government-provided, there is data captured on both the caregiver and the care recipient (or patient) that can address the effectiveness of the support provided and received.</p>
<p>The Scotland model reminds us that diagnosis can serve as launching point for referral to information, resources, and caregiver supports. While our long-term care system is not as robust, there are existing community, private, and government resources that could help the newly diagnosed. For example, diagnosis could activate referrals to: disease-specific advocacy organizations; information about the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Lifespan Respite program; or information about family and medical leave or other workplace supports.</p>
<p>To the larger point at hand, Scotland's Focus on Dementia is an example of what we could learn from other nations. Groups like the Global CEO Initiative, the Global Dementia Framework, and caregiving groups like the International Alliance of Carers Organizations can offer insight into the issues this council is currently wrestling with.</p>
<p>Second, I would encourage the council to prioritize a national Care and Support Summit. It has been acknowledged by academic experts and drug innovators alike that we are still many years from a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's and dementia. While we work towards research that will improve our future, there remains unmet needs now. Please remember the needs of families who are caring for individuals with dementia in our midst and the costs inherent in their contribution such as lost income, foregone retirement, and worsened health.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to join the Alliance and the Alzheimer's Foundation of America in an ongoing social media discussion during November on brain health and brain screenings. #TalkBrainHealth is an educational campaign to encourage family caregivers to talk with their families about brain screenings for older adults over the holiday season. We will be sharing a one pager that can be used as "talking points" for caregivers of older adults to discuss brain health and the role of screenings, which draws from key resources like the Institute of Medicine report on cognitive aging. More information is available at <a href="http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth">http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth</a> or you can find us on Twitter at #TalkBrainHealth.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time and for your continued commitment to the people and families living with dementia.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are a growing concern within the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. Age is considered the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and AAPI women have the highest life expectancy (85.8 years) of any ethnic group.<sup>i</sup> Barriers that prevent the early diagnosis and timely interventions and care of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among AAPIs include: cultural beliefs and language, lack of awareness that contributes to stigma, and limited accessible and culturally proficient services.<sup>ii</sup> Further, many AAPI older immigrants may feel discouraged to access aging and healthcare services (including screening for dementia) for several reasons: unfamiliarity with medical practices, having to locate interpreters, and the fear of miscommunication that may lead to misdiagnosis and improper treatment.<sup>iii</sup> Language and cultural barriers prevent them from full participation to the U.S. healthcare system, and studies have shown that "linguistic discordance," or miscommunication between patients and practitioners, is an implication of health outcomes and quality of care.<sup>iv</sup></p>
<p>The National Asian Pacific Center on Aging (NAPCA), which is the nation's leading advocacy and service organization committed to the dignity, well-being, and quality of life of AAPIs as they age, respectfully requests that the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services dedicate a council meeting to discuss (1) the effects of dementia on and (2) how to outreach to AAPI and other diverse minority communities.</p>
<p>Raising awareness of the impact of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias on AAPI and other diverse communities is an important first step to ensure that AAPI elders and their families, regardless of language, cultural, economic, or other barriers, will have access to and equity in the service, benefits, and programs that are available to all American seniors. Thank you for considering this request.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NAPA Advisory Council Meeting<br />
					Public Statement</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to address the Council today. Some of you may remember me as a regular attendee during the first two years after the NAPA was implemented. It is a privilege to be back again today.</p>
<p>I am here as a <strong><em>family advocate</em></strong> for individuals with intellectual disabilities and their families. I also come as a member of the NTG, a grass roots organization designed to increase the awareness of and services for those with ID who face the challenges of aging and further cognitive decline, including dementia.</p>
<p>My Brother Bill had Down syndrome and died of complications of Alzheimer's disease at age 49. (<em>Page 1 handout</em>). As advocates, our family was dedicated to insuring quality of life and quality of care across his life span, with a focus on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease required intensified efforts that we could barely muster and was the greatest challenge that we faced as a family in Bill's lifetime. It was a cruel and painful journey, filled with many unanticipated obstacles. After Bill's death I vowed that I would work hard so that other individuals and families would be spared this same experience. Today I am joined in spirit by the NTG and many families as I appeal to you to further include this special population in all aspects of research, care planning and funding.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past five years I have been blessed to meet many families from across the country. Some have been siblings and some aging parents who have continued to care for their loved ones as they all age simultaneously. There are a number of common concerns (<em>Page 2 handout</em>) that have been expressed. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of information, especially at time of diagnosis</li>
<li>Profound sense of <strong>Loss</strong> with further diagnosis</li>
<li>Fear about future-including financial fears</li>
<li>Difficulty formulating long term plan</li>
<li>Struggle to access community based coordinated care</li>
<li>Difficulty partnering with medical community</li>
<li>Being overwhelmed by demands of caregiving</li>
<li>Isolation and abandonment</li>
<li>End of life issues</li>
</ul><p>During my last public statement at a Council meeting a little over two years ago in the spring of 2013, I spoke of the urgent need of aging caregivers. I told of Betty, currently age 86, Frank, currently age 90 and Richard, soon to be 49, a special family who lives in a very small mid-western town (<em>Page 3 handout</em>).</p>
<p>Despite the presence of a small group home for medically fragile in their former community, Richard was not able to access the facility because of his diagnosis of AD. In April 2013, with family care giving resources depleted, Richard made the move to a 60-bed nursing home that was designed to meet the needs of individuals with ID and physical and mental health challenges. Richard was one of very few patients with AD and the staff was not specifically trained in the disease process. He was initially treated with Risperdal, as he was mobile at the time of admission and deemed a "challenging patient". Soon after he exhibited an adverse drug reaction. His parents alerted the staff to the observable changes and the medication was Dc'd. However, within 4 months of his admission to the facility, Richard had declined rapidly. By August 2013, Richard became wheel chair bound, had limited oral or physical responses and was totally dependent on others for all care. He experienced more frequent seizures and has been on increased medications.</p>
<p>Because of the distance of the facility from the family home and failing health, Betty, age 86, and Frank, age 90, relocated to the town of 1500 where Richard currently resides. They are a presence in the facility and committed to being there for Richard as he continues his decline. They are grateful for the care that Richard receives but mourn the loss of their socially active, garrulous son who can no longer utter a word. Formerly a man with a robust appetite, he can no longer lift a spoon to feed himself. They are pained by the emptiness in his once sparkling eyes. Richard will mark his 49th birthday in August of this year. (<em>Page 4 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Mr. S., age 87, still works part time including as a statistician for a major league football team, despite Parkinson's disease. His wife, soon to be age 84, has Alzheimer's disease. Their son Georgie, who had Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, died at home, this past March with his parents and sisters at his bedside. He was 51 years old and succumbed to aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of AD. (<em>Page 5 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Georgie's parents <strong><em>paid</em> for 24 hour private care</strong> and they honored his wish to stay home for over 3 years, as he declined. The only other option was a nursing home, where he did have a short stay after a broken foot. His sister Mary reported that every day after the nursing home stay, Georgie would wake up and he'd ask his Dad..."I stay home, Daddy?" Three of Georgie's sisters, Nancy, Pattie and Debbie live nearby and were instrumental in his care and that of their Mother. Georgie also had two special caregivers, Chris and Mark who helped to make home care possible. For all it was a labor of love, performed without question. The high cost was heartbreak. (<em>Page 6 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Georgie's family misses his smile and his sense of humor. And when they think of him, they remember his favorite song... <em>I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart...Down in my heart to stay!</em></p>
<p>I close with a brief recount of Fran and her family. She notes that 4 generations have been impacted by aging and concomitant decline. Fran's mother had been in a nursing home for a prolonged period of time and diagnosed with Parkinson's diseases and Lewy Body Dementia. The family assumed the cost of her care up until the time of her death. (<em>Page 7 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Fran's only sibling is a brother, age 65. He lives 7 hours away from her, has Down syndrome and is in the end stages of AD. Efforts to bring her brother closer to her were complicated by funding restraints from state to state and guardianship challenges. When her brother was no longer able to stay in the group home in which he had lived for 2 decades, a crises occurred. Where would he live? Who would cover the cost? What happened to his former funding stream? Her brother is now in a nursing home and the family worries from month to month about how the costs will be covered. Hospice came and went when he no longer met their criteria, taking a greatly needed wheel chair with them. The family then funded a $3500 chair so that he would not be bed ridden. Exhausting advocacy issues have intensified as his disease has progressed.</p>
<p>Fran, like many others, is emotionally overwhelmed and plagued by guilt over lost time with and attention to her husband, children and grandchildren as she tends to issues of intergenerational decline. She laments the fact that her brother, with his lifetime of cognitive impairment, was never able to communicate end of life wishes. She is often is faced with guardianship issues that may have best been modified years ago.</p>
<p>Their plight is real...the needs of individuals and families great. Families who have been lifetime caregivers often feel abandoned in the end. They have worked hard to independently provide care in the past. They now need extensive support that they struggle to access. I urge you to leave here today, more than 4 years after NAPA was signed and implemented, with a renewed awareness of the critical needs that remain in existence today for this underserved group of people.</p>
<p>Documents were previously provided for today's presentations. I am hopeful that Director Hoffman of the Dept. of Health, State of NY will review the populations identified as "disproportionately impacted" in the ADCSI initiative and consider including family members with ID. This could serve as a model of what might be done across the USA. Director Hoffman and many other Advisory Council Members have been our great champions in the past and I am hoping to count on all of you in the future. Thanks for this opportunity to be the voice of many who would otherwise not be heard.</p>

<p>It was nice to see you all at the last meeting. What I am about to say should not be taken in any negative way about you, as I have the highest regard for all of you. I have four key points I would like to make. They are by no means in order of importance as they are all of the highest importance and should be treated as such:</p>
<p><strong>Urgency</strong> is a word that I believe should and must be in your plan, preferably at the top of your list. I am very unsure as to why this word was not considered given that this disease is our greatest national health and economic threat in this century. <strong>Lack of action now will have serious consequences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Council Representation by People living with dementia</strong> -- As one who has sat through and heard many Council meetings, I am convinced that you need a few people living with early-stage dementia as Council members. They bring a unique perspective and feedback to the issues you are addressing, just as the caregiver representatives do. It is very frustrating to be a public observer at these meetings because there are issues that I am "uniquely qualified" to address; but am not allowed to do so. I believe listening to the needs and preferences of those actually living with this condition would enable the Council to "take a new view" on the importance of honoring our personhood; having community-based services to enable meaningful participation in our communities and our nation. You have heard all this before. <strong>THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE TO ENHANCE COUNCIL REPRESENTATION</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> - As an outsider I believe lack of full transparency is a serious issue for this Council. It should not matter whether you are from the government or the private sector. When you are on this committee you should all be equal to each other except for the chair. All information should be shared.</p>
<p>NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PROJECT ACT - PUBLIC LAW 111--375--JAN. 4, 2011</p>
<p>Based on the comments I heard at the committee meeting I was appalled by some of the possible misunderstanding of what power The Advisory Council. This group should all be on the same level playing field and titles should not matter other than for the chair of the committee. Every single person has the capability of making recommendations without any concerns of financials. All recommendations should be consider and recommended that actual benefit those with dementia. Both the Federal and Non-Federal members have the right to submit their recommendations to Congress. Below is a sentence from the law.</p>
<p><strong>ANNUAL REPORT.--The Advisory Council shall provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary's designee and Congress</strong></p>
<p>The legislation says that the Advisory Council will pass its findings on to Congress, and leaves it open so that the findings can go <strong>directly</strong> to Congress from the AC, or can go from the AC, to the Secretary of HHS and then on to Congress.</p>
<p>I find it sad that the government officials felt they could not share this information with their own members when in reality the recommendations could be seen by anyone in the world with Internet access as soon as they were posted to the ASPE website. While the public may not see the transmittal to Congress in its entirety, and clarity on who it was sent to, The Advisory Council should have access to this information.</p>
<p>I consider that extremely disrespectful to your colleagues. I personally saw this problem when you had removed the public comments. After many complaints I was assured it would be resolved; but a year has gone by and there is still no change.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations</strong> - I believe that some on members of the Advisory Council have the wrong idea about the expectations for their role. You have been chosen to play a very critical role. This came down from the President. He tasked all of you to identify the problems in dementia research, treatment and care and provide recommendations to advance efforts across all these areas. What an honor. You need to think differently in this role. For all of us who are living with dementia, we need the Council to examine our needs regarding better dementia care services and supports so that we can remain living in our communities as long as possible with our families. The Council needs to consider: What are the resources and funding needed to make that happen; and include them in specific recommendations. We all want a cure and understand that takes a great deal of funding. But <strong>millions of us are living with dementia right NOW and NEED community-based service recommendations NOW</strong>. You all have the opportunity to make one of the biggest impacts in your life. I and so many others are counting on you to do this. Don't be the person to kill the idea before it is presented.</p>
<p>Make the recommendations for what is needed to assist people living with dementia remain in their communities. Tell Congress what they need to spend to actually make those recommendations a reality, including research. Let the President and top government officials make the final decision. It is your mission to tell them the truth of what is needed; not to determine if it is possible or can even be funded. Yes, you may be asking for too much, but you will be doing what millions of us living with dementia need and want.</p>
<p>Today I believe many of the comments made and actions taken create short falls of reaching inspired goals. Please change that for me and the others that are truly counting on you. That would mean so much to me.</p>
<p>I truly hope I did not upset you again, but someone needs to speak up for all of us.</p>

<p>I wish to attend and offer public comment at the February 3, 2014 NAPA meeting in Washington D.C. Our organization (Lucanus Center) has offered community based services and supports to people with intellectual disabilities in Hollywood Florida for the past 40 years. I serve on the NTG committee and also the CFARF board of trustees. Together, we are partnering with the Broward Memory Center implementing the Dementia pilot for Florida for persons with intellectual disabilities and dementia. We presently provide services to over 75 either at-risk or with dementia. Our legislative appropriation is presently heavily supported in Tallahassee by the House, Senate and Governor Scott's office.</p>
<p>We will implement dementia services and supports utilizing the new CARF standards for dementia care for ID with dementia, NTG formal curriculum for caregivers developed in Hollywood July 30, 31, NTG dementia screening instrument, and the Cornell safety dementia friendly checklist. On Saturday, January 11, our group met in Hollywood Florida. The Broward memory center is devoting neurologist, geriatric psychiatrist, neuropsychiatric, geriatric RN, Geriatric Social Worker to work closely with Dr. keller, Dr. janicki and the entire Lucanusteam. We will being working with typical senior centers in February when I present at their annual conference.</p>
<p>I am hopeful we can gain unwavering support for your Advisory Council to guide, direct and support our efforts going fourth. One parent told of her daughter falling and she sleeps on the floor with her because she cannot pick her up off the floor. The mom also has early dementia but will not report to state officials in fear of losing her daughter and being placed in a nursing home. We are presently providing in-home supports to both the mom and daughter and the daughter has not fallen since. We also are beginning a new program at no cost to do the laundry for the aging caregiver.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration for our humble request,</p>

<p>I hope you are doing well and look forward to seeing you on Friday. At my PA state Alzheimer planning committee today I shared the following documents. I am hoping this could become useful document for the NAPA Advisory Council. I would also hope you have a way to share this with all the states. This is a document that I have worked on for over five months and I have had input from many people and organizations in the dementia arena along with 15 other advocates who are dealing with dementia. If you should have any question please feel free to reach out to me. I would also be interested on your thoughts.</p>

					Dementia-Friendly Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>As a person living with this disease I find it a challenge these days to be able to communicate with the rest of the team. While I appear to be very normal when we have short talks, there are many issues that I struggle with. I have lost the sharpness and quick response needed to be able to interact with you all at your level. It makes it even harder when many of you have very high IQs. With time you will learn that while I may not respond immediately, answers come to me many hours later. Sometimes they never do. When I hear conversations I do not hear the entire sentence but part of it, and in my mind I fill in the blanks. It's weird to know you have many answers in your head, but cannot find a way to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Because of all this, and because we are breaking up into various teams I want to ensure I will have the opportunity to share my visions of what I would like to see. Some of these ideas come from others who have created them before me, and many are my own ideas or a combination of both ideas.</p>
<p>There is no true order and some things may even be duplicated due to my lack of recall. I did have help from others in the editing of this document. Below is my short list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness, Education, &amp; Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people who don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>The stigma must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws needs to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and business.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Create work environments in which we can still feel productive without penalty to the employer or the person living with the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the researcher and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Communities </strong></p>
<p>My vision of a dementia-friendly community is a bit involved, but if it's implemented it will have a huge impact in many ways. When I think of a dementia-friendly community it refers mostly to those who are in the early to mid stages of the disease. This idea was first started in the UK by my friend Norm McNamara who is living with Lewy Body Dementia.</p>
<p>This community should include first responders, health providers, local businesses, public transportation providers, airports, and the public.</p>
<p>I think the best way to achieve this is to create a system that allows individuals to register with the state, or someone of equal standing, this should include care partners as well as it's important to have emergency info on the caregiver. I would like to see something similar to MedicAlert at a state level.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief outline of the MedicAlert system.</p>
<p><strong>MedicAlert® + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return</strong>® is a 24-hour nationwide emergency response service for individuals with Alzheimer's or a related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. We provide 24-hour assistance, no matter when or where the person is reported missing.</p>
<ul><li>If an individual with Alzheimer's or a related dementia wanders and becomes lost, caregivers can call the 24-hour emergency response line (1.800.625.3780) to report it.</li>
<li>A community support network will be activated, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies. With this service, critical medical information will be provided to emergency responders when needed.</li>
<li>If a citizen or emergency personnel finds the person with dementia, they can call the toll-free number listed on person's MedicAlert + Safe Return ID jewelry. MedicAlert + Safe Return will notify the listed contacts, making sure the person is returned home.</li>
</ul><p>Six in 10 people with dementia will wander and/or get lost. A person with Alzheimer's may not remember their name or address, and can become disoriented, even in familiar places. For people with dementia wandering is dangerous, but there are strategies and services to help prevent it.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has developed training tools and support programs to prepare law enforcement, EMTs, fire fighters and other first responders when they encounter a person who is wandering.</p>
<p>Anyone who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk for wandering. Even in the early stages of dementia, a person can become disoriented or confused for a period of time. It's important to plan ahead for this type of situation. Wandering and getting lost can happen during any stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:</p>
<ul><li>Returns from a regular walk or drive later than usual</li>
<li>Tries to fulfill former obligations, such as going to work</li>
<li>Tries or wants to "go home", even when at home</li>
<li>Is restless, paces or makes repetitive movements</li>
<li>Has difficulty locating familiar places like the bathroom, bedroom or dining room</li>
<li>Asks the whereabouts of current or past friends and family</li>
<li>Acts as if doing a hobby or chore, but nothing gets done (e.g. moves around pots and dirt without actually planting anything)</li>
<li>Appears lost in a new or changed environment</li>
</ul><p>The information on your medical alert bracelet will connect health professionals with your emergency medical information. We provide memberships and services designed to protect you and your loved ones during a medical emergency or time of need.</p>
<p>MedicAlert's medical bracelets, medical IDs, and other medical jewelry have been used to alert responders of the underlying medical conditions a patient may have - such as allergies, anaphylaxes, diabetes, and autism. First responders are trained by MedicAlert staff to recognize all forms of medical IDs, and our services ensure they get your up-to-date medical information, the moment they need it, to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. MedicAlert services and medical IDs are also used to communicate advance directives and can even help those with Alzheimer's or dementia make it home safely during wandering emergencies.</p>
<p>For more information please visit their website: <a href="http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp">http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp</a></p>
<p>Those who choose to register would wear a bracelet similar to the one above or some type of dog tag on a chain. By registering the people would be able to take advantage of many benefits. Family would need to register and could be set up when in the clinic for diagnosis as well as info bracelet... ordered and resources given out.</p>
<p>All those registered would be given a unique identification number that will have basic information that could be used in case of emergency. To stop the system being abused or compromised, this information should only be accessible by the relevant people, following a secure procedure and calling a special telephone number and providing the person's ID number. (This would only be accessed by calling a provided number)</p>
<p>It may include information like blood type, allergies, drug information, doctors, emergency contacts, and addresses.</p>
<p>This system needs to be linked with the 911 systems, and the yellow dot program. When a person calls the fire department the address should be flagged immediately when it comes up as a person with dementia living in the residence they are being dispatched to. This is important for many reasons.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may panic in this situation and may not know how to respond to the emergency conditions. They may be much worse than a child in some cases, and just curl up in a corner in fear and just stay there. They may not even speak out when people are calling their name. They may have even started the fire and are scared. They could be combative and the firefighters need to know how to deal with that situation. There are many other reasons why the firemen need to be aware before arriving.</p>
<p>If we ever have some kind of a natural disaster or need to evacuate for some emergency this system will be a major asset, especially for those who may be at home on their own. By being registered this will insure a much better outcome for those who may not be able to think for themselves. Many of these people would not leave with just a simple call and they may not even understand what is said in robo-call type alerts.</p>
<p>If the police are called that should also be flagged immediately. It could be the person with dementia calling in, and not able to articulate the problem. It could even be a false alarm because they are scared when there is really no threat. Sometimes people with dementia have been known to make serious accusations of being threatened by their spouse with a gun, which has led to spouses being locked up for days because the system was not aware of the person's dementia. Again, if members of the emergency services are coming to a house where a person with dementia resides, they need to treat threats in a completely different way otherwise it can escalate and even become deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Police: Weapons &amp; Driving </strong></p>
<p>While I am on the subject of issues with police there is a document which I shared with the chief of police a few years ago. While some changes are being implemented in some parts of the US, I am not sure they are being addressed in PA. I tried to reach out to my local police department and training facilities, but was just blown off. One of the biggest and most serious issues that I feel needs to be addresses is that of weapons. I came very close to taking my life, and even told a police officer on the telephone, but he refused to do anything. I just wonder how many other people pleaded for help and ended up killing themselves because nobody answered their cry for help. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with dementia get confused or feel threatened and may make accusations that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very differently from someone without dementia. Some would say like a mental illness. They believe what they are saying is fact.</p>
<p>We require a place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that this could be accomplished without too much impact on the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home, and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped for a sobriety test they may fail because they have trouble following instructions or poor gait. They may also be much slower with their responses, and may even give you a blind stare because they are confused. They may not be able to follow complex directions. Directions need to be broken down into steps.</p>
<p>I know we want to make the roads safe so we need better testing methods for Alzheimer's patients who drive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's patients can sometimes become very aggressive and defensive during an argument, they can even become threatening. This is the wrong time to try to remove them from their home. They need to be calmed down first; otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, because many will not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Be prepared to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost. We can get lost while driving; this does not mean we cannot drive. These two issues are often confused by many.</p>
<p>The car should also have some sort of identification mark. It could be tied-in with the yellow dot system; however, I am concerned that we may become a target because of that. We are much more gullible because of this disease and that could be a very serious issue. I was someone who always kept all those scammers at a far distance, and now I am starting to fall prey to some and think it will only get worse as time goes on and I get worse. It could be on a driver's license, like a donor or class B license. It could be a code that is not obvious to all.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Symbol: The Purple Angel </strong></p>
<p>There is a common logo that is slowly becoming the internationally known symbol for those living with dementia and I think we should use it. It is called the Purple Angel.</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngel.jpg" style="height:25px; width:27px" />To be used on all websites and dementia patients information and hospitals</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngelStamp.jpg" style="height:28px; width:30px" />For stores and businesses to show they know and have been educated</p>
<p>This was created by Norm McNamara and is starting to get a lot of recognition. In fact it is now going to be used in some US hospitals as an indicator that the person has cognitive issues; they hang it on the door of the hospital room of the patient. I recommend that we adopt this symbol for all programs connected to dementia-friendly communities.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>While I am speaking about hospitals, below is a list of issues that I have been working on with a local hospital in hopes of starting the first dementia-friendly hospital in PA. I was trying to build a training program with the Alzheimer's Association along with a question and answer session with people like me who are living with the disease. Below is the list I have shared with them. Some hospitals are actually doing a quick cognitive test by asking 3 words upon registering to see if there may be a concern even if the person does not have a diagnosis. I would expect that all hospitals would educate staff on the issues, for instance we can easily get lost while trying to find a department as an outpatient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<ul><li>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</li>
</ul><p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<ul><li>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself; a bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</li>
</ul><p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate - that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly or the stress of just being out of our routine. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>There are special things one needs to know about using Anesthesia. Anesthetic agents are a cause for concern in AD pathogenesis. Luckily, the field of Anesthesiology has addressed these concerns in an excellent and honest manner. I would defer to their consensus statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full">http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full</a><br /><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/</a></p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be to avoid isoflorane.</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While ordering food from a menu is simple, it is very overwhelming for me to keep track of things and what items may even go together, or are even needed. I will probably need help with this task.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus. Again this is why training on all levels is so critical.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. This is very subjective depending on the person. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given - they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>
<p>This is the wristband that will be implemented to all patients with dementia at Brooksville Regional Hospital, along with this square magnet to be place on the outside of the patient's room on the doorframe. Before any of these wristbands will be used, training seminars from the Alzheimer's Association will held for all of the hospital staff members. Training should start in about a month. This is a major step forward in maintaining the safety of all dementia patients during hospital stays.</p>
<p>The hospital loves the purple angel logo, We went through three different band designs before this. The problem being that purple is also the national color for DNR. What I love about it the most is that it's for "all dementias," which is what we truly need in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Businesses </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to dementia-friendly businesses; I envision that businesses take a 7 or 8 hour course provided for free by the Alzheimer's Association and others, to make them aware of the issues that people with dementia deal with, and what they may need help with. On completion of the course they will get a sticker that they can place in their place of business that says Dementia-Aware with a picture of the logo. By doing this we will be creating awareness, and educating many on how to make it easier for us to still function as members of society; something that is not always easy when you are an adult who is slowly becoming a child again.</p>
<p>Some of the issues may be</p>
<ul><li>feeling panic in a large store when becoming separated from the person they came with</li>
<li>being asked a question and not being able to respond, or even giving the wrong information</li>
<li>having trouble locating items in stores</li>
<li>no longer being able to calculate how much they have spent or can spend if they have a budget</li>
<li>getting lost, losing sense of direction, or not being able to locate the car in the parking lot</li>
<li>it would be nice to get assistance when there are similar products to choose from, because I can no longer do comparison shopping based on price, or if an item in the same category is on sale</li>
</ul><p>Not everyone will easily display, or even be willing to wear the bracelet or dog tag because of the stigma surrounding this disease. Only when this changes will people feel more comfortable about sharing their diagnosis with others.</p>
<p>Even though we are living with AD we should be encouraged to live life to the fullest. We need to keep our minds engaged. We should be able to work, and to still do high level functioning jobs, and the company not be penalized, and the person with the disease should not be impacted by SS because they are working. As volunteers I would expect that our transportation expenses be paid for, and maybe even lunch. This will have a positive impact on the people with the disease and be of great benefit to a company that can utilize the person. Some do not want jobs like pushing hospital beds around, or doing simple tasks when we have a high function skill set.</p>
<p>The state can help AD people to live life to the fullest in many ways. For those that are still driving they should be given a disabled sign for their car. It helps me in many ways such as finding my car when I park in a strange place or large lots. For those that are not driving, allow us the same opportunity as seniors. This will help us get around much easier. For suburban areas allow us access to the transportation for the disabled at the discounted rates.</p>
<p>The state can offer free access to national parks, fishing and boating for a small size water craft for the person living with the disease and a caregiver since in many cases they will need someone to take them. All of this can be centered on having the bracelet which will simplify the process and minimize any costs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to make it simple for these people because they will most likely not be able to fill out many of the forms needed to qualify. I am sure there are many other things that can be made available.</p>
<p>Writing skills can be impacted hindering communicating. An idea would be to forward our unedited letters to schools to be used as a part of the English classes; the students would edit the letter and send it back so we can send it. It would also be great if we could take college courses for free with the idea that we are not getting a degree or credits.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing tickets for travelling on trains etc. staff need to be aware that we may need help. We may not be able to check in at the airport unaided. We should not be penalized for not being able to take advantage of online offers because we cannot use computers. We may need to be taken to a gate or to a temporary room until our flight or train is ready (this does not mean we need to be ferried about in a wheelchair!)</p>

</ul><p>I would like to see a simple pamphlet be put together for those who are living with the disease covering all the benefits available to us with AD. It must be simple to understand, short and to the point. The procedure should include all of the resources available and where one should turn. Today one has no clue and they do not know what is available. This should be handed out with a diagnosis from your doctor.</p>
<p>Laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve. Let's stop burdening the social security system. Because there is no clear test for the diagnosis of YOAD, many diagnoses are delayed. Many people are terminated from jobs, and are unable to collect their long-term disability insurance, because of the two-year law. Most diagnoses occur much later, as in my case. I paid a lot of money into a long-term health disability plan in my company and I lost it all because of the law. I now get less than a third of what I would have been entitled to, and no medical coverage which I would also have had, all because of a law that does not work for individuals with this disease. Changes must be put in place until we have better tests available. If someone is terminated for non-performance and they have been diagnosed with dementia at a later time, they should have the right to go back at least six years to prove their case. Companies should not get a free pass because we all pay for this injustice. The two year law is a failure for people like me with dementia.</p>
<p>I was terminated from my job before I got a diagnosis which took another 6 years. Now I am forced to rely on government disability. Alzheimer's is a sickness. This is a disease, and the people who have it should be treated that way.</p>
<p>Companies need to treat AD like any other disability. The following comments were put together from a person who works in HR.</p>
<p>Tell your story to HR Management. What kind of company do they want to be? How will they protect their human resource that has dementia - and be good risk managers by taking appropriate action to minimize the risk of litigation for wrongful termination under ADA? What are the costs of unrecognized dementia in employees i.e., lost productivity, errors, quality, odd/unexplained behavior, a decline in management skills leading to more of the above? What are the State percentages? Give examples - If they are a company of 1,000 employees that equates to xx employees who will have early onset dementia - can they afford to be blind to the problems these individuals will cost the organization? Alzheimer's is not all about the needs of the caregiver. Little to no attention is given to the INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA. If the company has a PEP program (Personal Employee Program that typically provides 8 to 12 sessions of counseling when an employee suffers from personal problems (divorce, runaway kids, elderly care, etc.) why not have a Dementia Hotline/Exploration. Why not help people self-diagnose early and assist them to seek a medical diagnosis, so TOGETHER the employee and company can make a plan for them to ultimately exit from the company with dignity - example: an employee is still skilled, but may need to move from having the responsibility of being a manager to becoming an individual contributor. Why wait to FIRE someone for non-performance, when you could continue to employ the person until the day comes where there is no job which matches the employee's skills. A diagnosis of dementia IS protected under ADA. Why wait to be sued by an employee who was unfairly terminated because of his disability. Why not be proactive and humane, keep the person off unemployment; mitigate your exposure to litigation. Such a small cost to set up a program to assist and empower employees to work TOGETHER with them, give them dignity and determine together when it is time to go. Help them transition to retirement with disability; unemployment; assistance from the Alz Association.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Issues &amp; Necessary System Change </strong></p>
<p>Younger-onset Alzheimer's, also known as early-onset Alzheimer's, generally refers to those who are affected by the disease before the age of 65, usually in their 40s or 50s. Because of their younger age and healthy appearance, doctors often attribute symptoms of Alzheimer's to depression or stress, resulting in delayed diagnosis. These symptoms, such as challenges with short-term memory, impaired judgment and difficulty making decisions, eventually progress to a point where they affect workplace performance, and ultimately, jeopardize employment. Many individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's are in their prime earning years and supporting loved ones at home. The loss of income and access to employer-sponsored health benefits can be devastating.</p>
<p>This document reflects State and Federal issues that may not be working. My goal is that if the existing jurisdiction responsible is not able to enhance the process, the other will step in and fill in the gaps so people are not impacted. It is my hope that they can work together to fix the weaknesses in the system that may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>To help address their financial need, many individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In March 2010, the Social Security Administration (SSA) added early-onset Alzheimer's to its Compassionate Allowance Initiative, which expedites the disability determination process and serves as a trigger to begin the two-year wait for Medicare benefits for those under the age of 65. Family members (e.g. spouses and minor children) may also be eligible for benefits based on the applicant's work record. This addition by SSA has been a huge relief for individuals and families dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Many are treated like they are crooks when they apply for Social Security Disability. It creates an added burden on the family and the patient. People say that the Compassionate Allowance act will help people, but it did not help me, and many keep saying that it works. The following story is from an ongoing case. This program may be better but the people who run the programs are clueless in many ways on what a person with AD can or cannot do. This person is not only struggling financially, but has no one to look out for them. I cannot even imagine the hell they must be going through because it would take me forever to complete the same forms.</p>
<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>It's so nice of you to think of me. I wanted to add that the reason I was turned down on the first application and reconsideration was because I filled out the RFC form myself (I lived alone at the time and it was a necessity) and not for lack of medical evidence. My son now lives with me but only minimally supervises me and does the driving. An examiner at Social Security took it upon himself to send out an investigative unit because he felt I must be faking Alz even though in the course of the application and reconsideration, I saw 5 doctors, 4 of whom thought I had Alz disease and 1 CE examiner who thought it was possible but hesitated because I still have average intelligence (my IQ was in the 140s when I was in graduate school and now around 100, which I think this is an alarming decline). This SAA evaluator then proceeded to imply that all the doctors I saw were fooled. He even sent out an investigative unit to actually <strong>videotape me without my knowledge</strong> (following me to one my CE appointment one day and sending undercover police officers to my home the following day). I don't remember the investigators coming to my home and didn't see them at the hospital (obviously quite good at the stealth part). At the hospital, the doctor walked me out to the lobby because he was afraid I would get lost said a few minutes later I "disappeared (I got my ride, of course)." They went back to the doctor looking for me, and he apparently was very concerned I had actually gotten lost in the hospital. At my house, they said I walked slow to answer the door but I didn't limp (???) and was polite and had my hair combed (implying I was not disabled based on my outward appearance and probably less than 30 seconds of conversation). The evaluator felt that anyone who could describe their symptoms on an application, write mostly coherently, (though always needing multiple edits, spell check, and entailing a lot of repetitiveness) answer the door, use a phone, live alone, or drive in the early stages had to be faking it regardless of MRI, neurological tests, etc., that clearly gave me a diagnosis of EOAD. Long-winded, I'm sorry. I'm still feeling kind of abused and outraged. As for now, my lawyer thinks he can get me a hearing OTR and I'm hoping for that and a favorable decision If not, it will be another 12-15 months before I have a hearing date, this because the SSA evaluator apparently does not understand that early-stage Alzheimer's is not immediately visible on the surface. In the meantime, I am now in the process of selling my home to live with my adult son as we can no longer afford the upkeep (this is a modest home - but now far above my means).</p>
<p>I'm very lucky that my son is living with me to help, but it means I do not qualify for Medicaid because his income is now considered my income and puts us just above the income limit. He can't put me on his insurance as I don't qualify as a dependent because of my small LTD policy, which in turn needs to be repaid to the insurance company if I do get SSDI. I've gone from a single, self-supporting middle class woman, to lower middle class, now to poverty level in the course of about 4 years. Without my son's help, I'm probably within 3 months of living on the street. At the same time, I'm suddenly placing a tremendous burden on him and fouling up his goals in life.</p>
<p>Another note: I find it ironic that my neurologist tells me to exercise vigorously, take care of my health, and socialize as much as possible in order to function longer whereas I sense the government is telling me that I'm not eligible for disability insurance (despite working since age 13 and paying into the system for years) unless I give up, lie in bed, and wait to die.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Alz Assoc could find a way to educate the SSA evaluators on what Alzheimer's disease looks like in younger people in the early stages so that other people don't go through what I'm going through now. It would also be great if they could lobby for earlier Medicare benefits (rather than the 2 year wait after SSDI) for all disabilities that are only going to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Awareness is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Awareness of YOAD will change the public perception of who gets Alzheimer's - young people. People who are under 30 get it. Use commercials, billboards or posters in key places to get the word out. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people because most don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease not just a result of aging.</p>
<p>Awareness of outcomes for AD -- Currently people who have Alzheimer's cannot be cured. There is no way to slow the progression of the disease, and most die within 4 to 8 years of diagnosis. While these two statements are strong I feel this is what it's going to take to reach younger generations and others to jump in and help. We cannot beat around the bush; the public needs to know that this is a horrific way to die. Death by Alzheimer's is slow and painful not to mention the impact it has on the family. Places like the Alzheimer's Association and others need to open with all the facts about the disease so people are prepared.</p>
<p>Remove the negative stigma associated with the disease. Too many people are ashamed to let others know that they have this disease. They act like they did something wrong to get it. Now is the time to join me, come out of the closet, hold your head up and be proud in making a difference in how we are looked upon by ourselves, and others. WE need to show that we are still capable of doing some things at our own pace.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those that are no longer capable, while not impacting those that are still able to drive. It should be based on the person's true driving experience and ability, and not on perceptions or fears. It should have nothing to do with getting lost; GPS tracking devices can help us if that is a concern. Many people have the misconception that if a person with AD is in an accident the insurance company will not pay for the claim, or may even sue them. While there are many tests available to test one's driving, many are not fair to a person living with AD. In fact if the average person was given the same test they may even fail. Better tests that deal the individual living with the disease are needed and all must be able to test this test. Some of the cognitive tests do not correlate to driving ability, but to failing and singling out people with AD. That is completely unfair. For example I fail the Trail-Making Test, Part B and I still drive very good. The testing should be free or paid by insurance. These tests can cost around $300 -$350, and provide annually. Every 2-3 months we should drive with a spouse or other person who understands us to see how well we drive. That should be a regular part of our future lives, and they should be the ones to tell us when they feel it is time to give up driving. I am not saying that people with AD should not eventually stop driving, but it should be done for the right reasons -- that they will become a danger to them or someone else. What we need to focus on are the real problems of driving, and not the side issues related to them. We must embrace new ways to deal with people with AD and find new opportunities and technologies to use to our advantage so we can enhance the lives of those suffering with this disease, and so they can continue to lead a normal life for as long as possible. Do not fall into the one-size-fits-all trap because all those living with AD are different from each other and we must figure out a way to make everyone feel safe including those living with the disease. We are still human beings.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that one day I will have an accident and my license will be taken away. It may not have anything to do with my Alzheimer's, but it will be perceived that way. I have had 3 to 4 car accidents in my lifetime, some being my fault while most were others. We all have them. As a person living with AD I seem to notice much more. I see many people run through lights, not use turn signals or come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I see people cut others off or shift in to other's lanes without paying attention. All I can think is that if people saw me do any of these things they would want to take my driver's license away, yet all of these folks are normal and they just get a free pass. Why?</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is. One should not be impacted by other laws that were not designed or intended for those living with this type of disease. There are many state and federal programs that limit us from being able to contribute to or benefits we are not entitled to because of our age. Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia. A family should have a cap on what they must payout. Why should the surviving spouse be left penniless because their partner was sick? Is it enough that most of us have already had to deal with financial hardship we were not accustom to?</p>
<p>Pa. Caregiver Support Program (care recipient/household income must be @ 200% of poverty or below for max. reimbursement.</p>
<p>Below are just of a few of the ways this disease is costing me more money than ever. I once did most things around the house and now I have to rely on others and the cost is adding up very quickly. Many things are becoming neglected which will have a greater cost in the long run. I used to be good at comparison shopping and now I no longer do it because I cannot recall the price so I can compare. This has such a huge impact from food, gas, utilities and everyday items.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), individuals with a pre-existing condition receiving SSDI can join high-risk insurance pools3 and receive immediate health insurance coverage while they wait for Medicare benefits to become available. This has been particularly helpful for those who are unable to find affordable health insurance because of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The program will end in 2014, at which time individuals can purchase health insurance through their state-based insurance exchange or qualify for Medicaid under its expanded criteria. Pennsylvania has yet to decide whether or not it wants to participate in the Medicaid expansion, which according to one estimate, will cost the state 1.4 percent more than current spend to reduce the number of uninsured adults by over 40%.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of care, Alzheimer's imposes an immense burden on families. Last year, there were an estimated 664,384 unpaid caregivers in Pennsylvania, providing 756,600,213 hours of unpaid care valued at over $9 billion. Unfortunately, the physical toll of caring for Alzheimer's also resulted in over $427 million in additional healthcare costs to unpaid caregivers in your state. To assist those who care for people with Alzheimer's in Pennsylvania, the state offers the Pennsylvania Caregiver Support Program. Preference is given to caregivers of care recipients who are 60 years or older, but eligibility was recently expanded to include care recipients who are 18 years or older. All care recipients must demonstrate functional limitation and financial need.</p>
<p>Regrettably, age is still a barrier to other support programs for individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's and their caregivers. All caregiver support programs that receive funding under Title III of the Older Americans Act require care recipients to be at least 60 years or older. Likewise, Pennsylvania's Medicaid 60+ waiver and aging block grants are only available to those who are at least 60 years old. Restricting eligibility by age, rather than diagnosis, forces many families affected by younger-onset Alzheimer's to exhaust their own resources and put their own health and financial security at risk.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways to make it better for those impacted. Physician education -- Doctors need to be better educated, and need to commit to a more timely diagnosis so that patients can collect the benefits they deserve and are entitled. Doctors should not act like our lives are over. Once a diagnosis is made it should automatically trigger a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist so the person can learn to deal with the devastating news. Many people are in denial and waste that last few years not knowing what to do. Instead they should be living life to the fullest. Make the memories. We must be encouraged to make living wills and put our financials in order quickly since our minds are going. We have no time to delay. Encourage participation in medical trails and offer frequent checkups.</p>
<p>Living wills should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>We must encourage research and provide funding. In order to eradicate this disease we need to find more sources of funding and redistribute current government funding to bring Alzheimer's to a level comparable to other disease research. Trials need to provide more flexibility by using technology. Many are unable to participate due to lack of flexibility. Some people do not participate in clinical trials because they feel it will not help them. They need to know that it's not about them but what they do can help someone in their family should they get the disease. Since a cure may be long in coming, it would also be nice to see more funding provided to investigate treatment methods to maintain independent function longer. The drug companies have taken the stage and it's all about what increases their profit and not necessarily about what will help the patients.</p>
<p>Make government grant programs free, fair and balanced - Some researchers using government research grants are discriminating by age and minorities because of rules being set forth by both the provider and the receiving researcher. This will prevent the formation of an accurate picture of this disease. For example, black people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's. Why?</p>
<p>Eliminate the term Caregiver - Come up with a new term for the word caregiver when used for people in the following stages Very mild decline (2), Mild decline (3) and Moderate decline(4). We find it very demeaning and do not like being treated like a child. Help us where we are weak, but don't give up on us just because we have now been labeled with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>We need away a way to break down many of the silos and built a coalition of companies and sites to work as one. Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) is a diverse and growing national coalition of 58 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The only sad part is the Alzheimer's National has not joined due to not being able to set politics aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/</a></p>
<p>This is all part of the problem - a lack of willingness to work together. I am not sure what the state can do here but we need to find a way to encourage others to work in harmony for the greater good of what we all seem to claim. We are doing this for dementia. Sometimes I really wonder and I think it just a business for these folks.</p>
<p>I know I have made many recommendations around the use of the Alzheimer Association as part of this document. Because of that I want to give full disclosure. I was a past ESAG member and I am currently still an ambassador for them. For those who know me they would tell you I am not influenced by others and my dedication is to those impacted by the disease. With that being said I do feel they deserve a lot of credit for what they have accomplished in the last 30 or more years. They take a lot of heat for some issue that are out of their control due to some high level expectation of the public.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do not want you to think that they have all the answers because I and many others realize that they do not do justice for many like me who are dealing with the disease. They focus on the caregiver and not us. Part of the problem in my eyes is the lack of a business mind across the board, and lack of a CEO approach to business. Because of that scenario there is much inconsistency in the organization and much time is lost in understanding our needs and minds. That all leads to very slow response or lack of response to the very services they think are great. They have this internal mindset that everything has to be done a specific way and that is always the right way, yet the people are not given the tools. The sad truth- it is not and I have worked on changing some of that and I can assure you it's not an easy task. I encourage that we continue to work with them but at the same time we need to demand change and at a much faster pace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am sharing this with you in hope that, as you do your planning, you take my findings in to account when making recommendations to others. We must treat all people who are suffering from dementia, regardless of stage, with the highest level of respect all the way through to the end. While this may not apply to all, it would appear that many who are even in stage seven are still able to communicate in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Living Life with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Below are some articles I have written in the past, you may learn how someone with AD is dealing with this disease. These are my favorite that I feel people have been able to learn and see another side that they did not know before.</p>
<p>I have worked on this for about five months, and recently I shared the email below with many sites related to AD for feedback. Most of those who had reached out to me were able to support my findings. The bottom line is that while most of us have limited thinking capacity many are able to communicate; we just have to find a way that suits the individual. I received a lot of feedback. My biggest concern is that most people are clueless, and assume that we cannot understand what they are saying about us; many say cruel things. Just try to imagine for a minute what it would be like to hear what others may say or do to you, and you are never given an opportunity to defend or express yourself. That is what is happening to most of these folks.</p>
<p>We must find a better way to educate caregivers, health professionals, and all those working with people living with this disease. The biggest problem I see is that everything is time-based because of the costs. This view will not work for people. It will also take special training, and the need to break with our normal habits of communicating. If we are going to be able to reach out to them, we need to change. We are still human beings and we deserve to be treated in a respectful and dignified manner.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I have been living with AD much longer than most people who have had this devastating disease. I am in need of your help to prove a point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have learned that as we progress with Alzheimer's/dementia, we lose our brain functioning and can no longer think. I am starting to believe that this is not true.</p>
<p>It has now happened to me on multiple occasions where I was asked a question, and I am able to formulate the answer in my mind, yet I found myself unable to verbalize it. Sometimes my mouth may move but nothing comes out. It was the weirdest thing, and I could not understand why it was happening to me. I was aware of what was going on, but could do nothing.</p>
<p>Since that time I have asked 18 other people with some type of dementia, and of them 16 had similar experiences. Two of them said they had not. This makes me think that as this disease progresses our brain may still be functioning, yet it is unable to communicate with the rest of the body, allowing it to have less control than it would normally have. I truly believe I am on to something, and was curious as to how I can try to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. About three years ago I met the daughter of a man with AD. He was no longer communicating with her because, she was sure, he could no longer commutate at all. Someone suggested she ask a question, and keep totally silent for at least two minutes after. About a minute and a half later he finally responded to her question. From that time on she realized what she had to do and was thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to think it's going to be that easy; it will take a lot of work, patience and persistence on your part. Here is what I would like others to try for someone who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. First of all take the person to a very quiet room; it should not have any kind of background noise even from things like an air-conditioner blowing. Those noises are real problems for me, and would assume it will be a bigger issue for them. Such noises really have an impact on my ability to process and focus. You should also do this at a time of day that they are not tired. It becomes very challenging for us to try to focus and listen to what others say. It really becomes tiring, and we get burned out quickly.</p>
<p>When you start to speak to the person use short sentences, and pause in between them so they have time to process what you are saying. That is very important. Tell them that you think you have found a way to communicate with them. Tell them you are going to look at them closely for some sort of sign. It could be an eye movement, maybe looking to the right or left or down or up. It could be a smile. It could be a finger moving or a fist being made. It may even be them sticking their tongue out. I would start by focusing on parts of the body that may still show signs of control. You must become a detective and keep looking at various body parts for some sign. It may not happen the first time or even a second time. It may never happen and I could be wrong. But if I am right just think of the benefits that will come out of this for you and your love one.</p>
<p>Reassure them that you will continue to look for a signal and they should keep trying the best they can at their speed. Ask them a simple question like "do you love me? If yes lift your finger or lower your finger". Again you will need to keep quiet, and observe for at least two minutes. Keep doing this and try this with different parts of the body. They may not have control over certain parts, and that may be an issue. If you do see something make sure you point that out to them and ask them to do it again to insure they really are responding. If this turns out to work find a way to use that same body part to get yes or no responses from the person. Keep in mind that this may not always work and you may need to be creative. Maybe just keep the finger raised longer if they mean no, or tap it twice etc., but that may be too much to ask.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind if the person has not had any real dialog with someone for a long time this would also take more time. No matter what do not become discouraged, try this at least three different times on different days. Like I said this may never work and I have it wrong.</p>
<p>If this does work please reply to this site with your contact information so I can speak to you. If this works for a few it makes me believe that we need to treat these folks completely different to the way society treats them today. This will change so much about what people really believe is happening to our minds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at www.alz.org. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple on Friday, Sept. 21 for World Alzheimer's Month. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are counting on all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have visited many websites that talk about Alzheimer's/dementia. The one thing that they all have in common is that not one of them encourages those of us who have the disease to continue to live and enjoy our lives. While I realize AD is a progressive and devastating disease we are still here, we are still alive, so treat us that way. Do not write us off.</p>
<p>I have always been savvy when it comes to finances and have always been a saver. One day I was speaking to a friend of mine who has AD, and I was telling her how I did not want to spend a lot of the money I had saved, because I wanted to leave it for my wife for that rainy day. My friend told me: "This is the rainy day. What are you waiting for?" She was right, and that's exactly how I started to think.</p>
<p>Just because we are living with AD, does not mean we should curl up and think our life is over before it actually is. There is so much more we can still do to enjoy life. Make wonderful memories with your loved ones before the days turn ugly.</p>
<p>One thing I had always wanted was to own a convertible, so we purchased one. I wanted to drive it down to the Keys in Florida. I have a friend out in California who also has AD. She has an RV and had planned to travel around the country before she declined and was incapable of driving anymore. One day she mentioned that she was going to the Keys and I decided to meet up with her. I also wanted to go deep-sea fishing to catch a big game fish. Don't get me wrong I am not person who goes fishing, but it was something I have always wanted to do. I had looked into it and it was very pricy, but it has always been on my bucket list. I think we all have a list if we stop and think about it.</p>
<p>I had no real plans; I just wanted to go out and drive my convertible, to feel the fresh air and admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy nice weather. I had a great time. I had a permanent smile on my face. I decided to stay with my friend in the RV for a week and visit various campgrounds along the way. That was a whole new experience, and some of the places we stayed at had fabulous views.</p>
<p>It was great to be out on our own, not having to rely on caregivers all the time. We had some difficulties, but we were able to mange on our own. It cost me a few extra dollars along the way because when I purchased something I could not remember the price in order to be able to compare, and sometimes I took the wrong road and had to take the turnpike, but these were minor issues. This road trip made me feel so much better about me. It was good for my mind; I came back stronger because of what I had achieved.</p>
<p>This disease has a way of making you feel like you are no longer cable of doing things on your own. You lose your self-esteem and your self-confidence. After this trip I felt great.</p>
<p>I did have to opportunity to go fishing. It was such a beautiful day with perfect conditions. The fish were not really biting to begin with but it didn't matter I was just happy to be on a boat again. Then I caught a fish that was about 10-12 inches long. Then I caught a barracuda that was at least 18 inches long, and then one over two feet long. Not to long after that I got the big one, a king macro that was 42 inches long! You should have seen the smile on my face. It is memories like this that we need to be making.</p>
<p>My friend in the RV has decided that she will not just use her mother's china and silverware on special occasions. Instead she took them with her in the RV. It gives her pleasure to use them every day. How many of you have a wonderful expensive hand bag or nice watch, which you only use on a special occasion?</p>
<p>Life is short; take pleasure in using those treasured items now. Start to create your own bucket list, don't just write it, DO IT! There are many wonderful memories that you can still make. Make them now before it's too late. Stop focusing on the negative. Make these last few years be the best of your life. You must do this now, before your mind no longer works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Since being diagnosed with Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease I have dedicated much of my time to its advocacy. Over the years I have worked with many people in different parts of the world, and through my experience I have come to realize that a major problem in reaching a cure is our actions. The way we treat not only those who suffer from this disease but those who care for the afflicted, the focus on funding and research and the lack of communication and collective action. Although there are many brilliant people who are involved in Alzheimer's and Dementia action and research I feel that following some simple principals and plans we could bring about real change in the world of these diseases.</p>
<p>PARTICIPATION -- Patients, caregivers, family and friends must become advocates</p>
<p>FUNDING -- Unprecedented action from government and public sector is vital</p>
<p>TEAM WORK -- Organizations dedicated to fighting the cause must work together to reach a shared goal</p>
<p>RESEARCH -- It is imperative that professional medical research personnel work hand-in-hand with patients</p>
<p>LIVE -- Those suffering from the disease must learn to live happy and fulfilling lives</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> -- The government wants to hear from us! I have been doing this a long time and I am told over and over again by government officials that they need to have a clear idea of the numbers of people with Alzheimer's so they can make the appropriate changes to policy etc. In order for the government to do something they need to see people with the disease. I know people have busy lives but if we want things to change, patients, caregivers and friends need to start taking action.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By getting involved! Write to the people who can help - government, health officials, and the press. But be mindful that you have to be persistent with these people, you have to fight. Can you imagine the impact if even a small percentage of the millions of sufferers took a little time to have their say?</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong> -- We must look at other funding models for this disease. Unlike HIV and cancer, there are no survivors. Patients will continue to place a massive financial burden on the national economy; we need to be more proactive in how we fund research, care, medication and support for loved ones and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By writing to Congress, and the National Institute of Health. These people are responsible for prioritizing the distribution of funds to critical diseases - Alzheimer's disease is not on the list; we need it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM WORK</strong> -- There are many organizations out there hosting their individual fund raising programs, which is to be commended but the downside to this is that they still insist on operating independently on one another. These people need to see the bigger picture, they need to set aside their politics and differences, and come together as one and work together -- after all, they share the same goal don't they?</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? Well we can stop complaining about these organizations and give them solutions and guidance. Together we have the power to bring about change. Keep informed of all the latest news and action, don't listen to gossip or rumor -- check the facts; do your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen. I am living with Alzheimer's disease. I spend almost every waking hour advocating for increased funding for research that will improve the treatment of this dreadful disease. In 2008, at the age of 49, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms began at age 39. There are more than five million Americans now suffering from this devastating disease.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research into critical and devastating diseases such as cancer and HIV/Aids. Yet there is much neglect and discrimination regarding the allocation of funds for research into Alzheimer's and related dementias. As a person who experiences the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease every day I hope that research will lead eventually to postponing the onset or slow the progression of this disease, if not prevention and cure.</p>
<p>Currently, Alzheimer's disease only receives about $450 million for research from NIH, compared to more than $5 billion for cancer and more than $3 billion for HIV/AIDS. I am astonished at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing the number one health epidemic. Historically, leadership from the federal government has helped lower the number of deaths from major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, stroke and many types of cancers. This past experience provides hope that increased efforts directed at Alzheimer's disease will be met with similar success.</p>
<p>There are many more Americans living with Alzheimer's than HIV; more funding is desperately needed. If we do not act now this disease has the potential to bankrupt this country. Money allocated today will have an enormous return on investment if it leads to the kind of successes obtained for other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have not yet been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease it's just a matter of time. I hope that my advocacy will help prevent future generations having to suffer my fate and that of many others. You can help by increasing NIH funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>I appeal to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the respective appropriations committees: Make the hard choices; increase funding for Alzheimer's disease. Do everything necessary to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gets the exposure, commitment and funding necessary to change the course of the disease before millions more Americans are affected.</p>
<p>My work as an advocate has provided opportunities to share my story on a national platform. I have provided public comment during meetings of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services in addition to having my personal essay about overcoming the stigma of the disease featured in the Alzheimer's disease World Report 2012. I have also become a member of the Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisory Group, helping to raise awareness of the disease and provide insights on the most appropriate programs and services for individuals in the early stage of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>I hope that what I am doing now will allow me to leave this world knowing that I have done everything possible to make generations to come have a fighting chance. Do not forget these people or the future generations who will develop this disease. We face dying in the worst possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As an Alzheimer's patient, I find it very difficult to perform tasks that I was once very capable of performing. Sometimes I am better than other times at doing the same task. People around me have accepted this fact and have tried to be very forgiving when I run into issues doing a task or when just trying to remember something. I really think that people around me should challenge me more at times.</p>
<p>For example, many of my doctors kept questioning me about whether or not I should still be driving. This of course was mentioned to my wife who also started wondering. I finally had a driving test a few years later. It was recommended that I no longer drive, even though I passed the test. I was almost borderline, but there was concern that I may not recognize when I become worse and could then become a danger. First of all, I have to tell you that the test they performed was not fair. I wonder how many regular people would be able to pass this test. The test also relied on me to learn new things in order to take the test. That is not fair since I have been driving the same vehicle all this time and nothing has changed. This constant talk about my driving has totally killed all of my self-esteem about driving. Every time I was in the car on the road with my wife, she constantly pointed out any mistakes I made, and her reaction time was much quicker than mine. I do realize I am a bit slower in my response time, but that is why I give myself more space between the other cars. Sometimes I am very far back or I just don't want to go around that slow car. There is nothing wrong with not feeling comfortable to go around that person. Let me do it at my speed.</p>
<p>I see many people on the road that I feel are so much worse than me and I wonder why they are still on the road, if I am supposedly so bad. I decided that I was going to drive to visit my daughter in South Carolina. I live in Jamison, PA in Bucks County. I was very scared to take this trip but I was trying to prove something to myself. It could have meant the end of my driving if I made a serious mistake along the way. I drove in one day, about 700 miles, with the help of a GPS in my car. The more I drove, the more I was starting to feel comfortable behind the wheel. A few other people on the road made serious mistakes along the way and I easily avoided a possible accident. This trip was the best thing I could have done for myself. I now have almost all of my self-confidence back and my wife no longer makes constant comments about my driving, unless I have a real issue. I have now had two close calls that required quick thinking and maneuvering to avoid an accident. In both cases, I was able to avoid the issues without my wife's comments. Again it may have taken me an extra second or two to react, but I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Coping Strategies for Daily Challenges </strong></p>
<p>Because of this situation, I feel even stronger than ever that it is important to be challenged. I know it may be easier for you to do something for an Alzheimer's patient because it's much quicker for you to accomplish the task. But I really believe that if you take the time to coach us along the way, we may do better in the long run. Believe me, I know it's got to be very aggravating at times, but I really appreciate it. It takes a lot of patience on the part of the helper. Everyone is different and you need to know at what point in time you should not push. It's also hard to be patient and not raise your voice at the person you are trying to help, because it will only make it worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering dates or things I need to do.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use my computer and Microsoft Outlook to keep me straight by sending me reminders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Getting email using regular places like Google or Yahoo is a challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My daughter had set up my Outlook to retrieve emails from all my accounts, and they arrive in the same format which makes it so much easier to read, and it allows me to use common folders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I forget to reply back to people's emails.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I flag them with a reminder date so it will automatically send me a reminder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Remembering passwords is a real challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have created a personal system that works great, I also rely on the computer to store many of them; however, it is a real challenge when the system does not work. I also keep files with the password information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering the day, the month and the year.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have watch that displays all the information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have an extremely complex TV, stereo and entertainment system, which requires many remotes and settings to be used.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I purchased a smart remote that allows me to put in all the steps at once, and press one button which takes care of sending all the commands to all the devices at once. It works great until it fails. Not sure how much longer I can maintain it. It's a bit involved</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Most of my lawn power tools are a struggle to use.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not think I have any coping method other then I keep trying different things until I get them to work. The problem is most are new, I find it easier to work with tools I am familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I drive I don't always feel as comfortable behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I sometimes need to take more precautions, and allow more distance between the car in front of me, and I may drive a little slower. I am also much more alert and focused during these times. It makes it hard because when I travel with my wife she wonders why all of sudden I drive slower, when normally I am flying. There is nothing wrong with going slower and being cautious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I don't do much of anything anymore.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The other day I was speaking with my neighbor who was waxing his car. This gave me some inspiration to want to do it. When people mention things to me it sometimes gives me what I need to take it to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I purchased a camera; however, no matter how many times I read the manual I still don't seem to be able to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: Make sure you buy one that works completely automatic without needing to do anything. It is frustrating at times when you would like to do something on your own but just can't remember on how to do it. I have learned to accept it but I still try and fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Spelling and forming sentences has become a real challenge.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take advantage of using the computer to guide me in the correct spelling of a word. That is becoming harder because often it cannot figure out what I am trying to say. I also ask others to look things over for me, and to correct them for me. It's kind of frustrating for me because I am really concerned that I may not be able to do this much longer. I have seen a big decline in this over the years. I seem to notice this more than my other skills because I do it so often. While I am sometimes ashamed of sharing it with others, I still need to communicate so I try to not think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Sometimes when I want to do certain things I need to stop and think.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: If I want to work on a project I will spend a lot of extra time trying to think of the best approach, this doesn't always help, but I tend to work at a slightly slower pace and am aware that things will go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Finding past emails or letters</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The computer is such a wonderful tool in so many ways. It allows me to search the entire computer as long as I can remember a word or two in the document I am looking for. While it may take a while I would not be able to survive without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer do many things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I rely on my wife for many things nowadays. I am not sure if that is a coping strategy. When anything important needs to be considered, I ask her for her help. She does all the financials, and planning of most things. It is frustrating but I realize I cannot do it on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I get lost or cannot figure out how to get from one place to another. Maps are not easy to follow anymore even the ones that you print out from Google.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: GPS! I cannot imagine what it was like for people like me before GPS and the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear that one day I will be lost or not be able to communicate with others due to a temporary stress or decline in my mental capacity.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have chosen to not be concerned about that. I have a medical tag on me all the time that has my medical condition along with important contact information. I will continue to go wherever I want to go. I realize I will need to rely on others to get there. I will need to ask others for help frequently, and to ask multiple times so others don't send me down the wrong path. It will take me longer to get there, but I cannot let that stop me. Living in fear is also no way to live. I know there are good people that will help me when the time comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Some things I do get me very frustrated</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I no longer try to do those things so I do not get frustrated</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I write notes as reminders</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I only write a few notes as if I have too many they just become overwhelming, and I would lose track of them because there are too many.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I need more time to do things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I leave much earlier for meetings and places so I can allow for issues along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: If I start to get frustrated doing something.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I move on to something else and then I try to come back and do it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear I may get lost when I go to new and far places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take a cell phone with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I go shopping and lose track of the person I am with I sometimes start to worry a little bit.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to calm myself down and look for them. If I cannot find them I will try to stay by the door we came in so I can see them at that register</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My wife added masking tape with a marking pointing to off. No more issues. I have the feeling that over time I will need many reminders like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble hearing people speak in loud places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to not go to restaurants or other places where I will be put in that situation if I can help it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer use my video recorder.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I now have TiVo which makes it so much easier to do things. I still need some help, and my wife can help when I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I try to communicate with much smarter people.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I believe that my reaching out to and working with people who are very smart will delay the deterioration process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I cut the grass, or do something that requires me to be a bit more stable on my feet.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use a good pair of shoes, or even a low cut boot. It really helps me become more stable on my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I could get hurt while doing yard work.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not wear lose clothes or short sleeved clothes when doing yard work so I do not get hurt. Wearing shorts has already led to a broken foot because the pants leg got caught on the shifter. I also wear safety glasses. The problem I have is I don't always remember to take these precautions, or sometimes I think it's not necessary because I feel I will be careful if I am doing something that will just take a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Just the other day I was thinking in my head that I had to turn a grate on my fireplace, and I was thinking it may be hot.</p>
<p><strong>No Coping Strategy</strong>: Instead of being careful and just putting one finger closely to feel for heat, I just tried to touch it with three fingers to lift -- I got burned. How do you get a copping strategy for becoming stupid? It seems that my mind is not communicating with the rest of my body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: All the people around me know I have AD, so most of them are keeping an extra eye out on me which is nice to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to keep some type of a schedule. I get up every day at the same time and try to eat at the same time. This kind of helps to do things like taking my drugs or other things. The second I change my routine you can be sure I will forget to take my drugs or do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I double and triple check myself on many things I do. Daily Challenge: ???? Coping Strategy: I try to find some humor in my issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ?????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I ask people for help and ask a lot more questions of others</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take lots of breaks</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to know my limits and will not start a task if I feel I cannot do it. Or I will have someone work with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A few months ago one of my friends mentioned that I am always talking about things related to Alzheimer's. While I know I spend my days advocating for this disease I did not realize I was that bad. Especially with those I am not trying to convince or influence. Although I appreciate the person telling me, it has really bothered me.</p>
<p>I started to give it some thought and tried to understand why and what I could do to change that. Not too long after that my wife made a similar comment, and that really hit home because their comments to me were so close together.</p>
<p>I realized many things have contributed to this. The most important is I no longer work and I feel like I am locked in this house; I really have nothing else to do. I wish I could still be working and doing something meaningful, but unfortunately my skills required to perform those jobs are no longer there because of my Alzheimer's. I use to go to work, I used to talk with others about many different topics, not just work but everyday world issues.</p>
<p>I have tried to have similar conversations with people about issues in the news, and I don't always have the right information since I don't always understand it all, and only retain bits and pieces. While there was a time I was a news junkie, now I can rarely recall many of the topics or even can tie other stories together in my mind so I can speak intelligently. I have recently found myself starting discussions that go south because I start out with part of a subject, and when we delved into it deeper I was at loss for information. I felt stupid because I could no longer speak about something I once found very easy. I used to be great about talking about political issues which really requires you to know what you are talking about, but now I can barely defend my position, and I do worse for even bringing the subject up, and then I feel bad because I was not able to point out the real issues so the person could really make a true assessment.</p>
<p>Since I have no real job I have made it my mission to advocate for Alzheimer/dementia. I try to keep my mind as engaged as possible. I also try to focus on things that most don't, like the high hanging fruit which is probably not the best for some on like me. That involves dealing with many high-level people. While I do good at first I don't always have the answers they require, and sometimes may come across as not knowing what I am doing. It is very frustrating knowing that in my brain I have the answers, but I just do not know how to retrieve the information needed to help me do what I need to do. Especially when I need it the most, I may remember later on sometimes, but it's too late. There was a time that I could retrieve everything to my favor and keep track of everything one person would say to me.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I listen to the weather report multiple times a day and I never seem to know what the weather is supposed to be like, which I always use to know. I just do not seem to retain it.</p>
<p>I use to like reading the paper and I no longer do that because I have trouble retaining what I read or I don't remember how the story relates to something I read a few paragraphs back in the same article.</p>
<p>I used to have hobbies that I can no longer do because of the disease. I use to love boating and tinkering with electronics. I can no longer do any of these things. I rarely do anything around the house because I am afraid I will make it worse.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with others I do not always remember what we have spoken about in the past. I always hated it when you spoke to certain people and they keep repeating the same information you had spoken about in the past. I do not want to become one of them. There are so many discussions I want to have but I just can't because the lack of my ability and more. I miss that so much. To have an intelligent conversation with someone that can reply with meaningful information, where we both walked away with some new and interesting facts would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I was never one to blow my own horn, but I do that today so others can see some of the steps I have made in hopes that they feel they are willing to take risks and help me expand my mission.</p>
<p>I have accomplished some great things and I think that is what I may share with my friends. Maybe I am repeating myself and I don't know it. I keep trying to figure out how I can change, but I struggle because I do not know what to do. It seems that Alzheimer's has taken over my life and not sure what or how to change.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>

</ul><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is a deadly and unforgiving disease that affects 5.4 million Americans and costs hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. One in seven American workers is, or has been, a caregiver for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia. A crisis of this magnitude merits an equally serious response. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a bold and groundbreaking effort that will help beat Alzheimer's by 2025, but it must be strengthened if we are to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services met in January and made recommendations to HHS. The Council emphasized the urgent need for greater federal research funding, stronger and expanded support for families and caregivers, and a detailed road map with milestones to advance us towards the ultimate goal: the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease by 2025. These recommendations are so critical to the effectiveness of the plan that the Council unanimously approved them.</p>
<p>As the Department updates the national plan, I urge you to ensure that these recommendations are included in the 2013 version. We can beat Alzheimer's, but we need a plan that's aggressive, that ensures we have the resources we need, and that includes a detailed road map to getting to a cure.</p>
<p>My mother (1919-1998) had 3rd or 4th stroke with dementia complicationher last 3 yrs.Primarily, her last yr., she lost her memories of family members, events and communication skills.My mother was a vibrant wife of a USMC LtCol (Retd) husband (1919-1991).She basically was a single-parent for 24 yrs. of active assignments, raising 3 daughters and son, all with special needs, before there were medical diagnoses, education &amp; community supports.</p>
<p>We don't need to go back to what my mother fought against--the denials and accusation by providers, of whom she tried to seek help.The families today and in the future need all the hope medical research can give that Alzheimers/dementia does not have rob individuals of their most precious family memories.</p>

<p>I would like to submit the following comments to be shared at the January 14, 2013 meeting on behalf of Jean Wood.</p>
<p>Dear Members of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services:</p>
<p>On behalf of my collaborators in ACT on Alzheimers, the implementation group for the Minnesota Alzheimer's Plan, the Minnesota Board on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association MN ND, we would like to express our deepest appreciation for the work of NAPA and the recommendations to dedicate $10.5 million to seed the development of state action plans, restore ADSSP funding to $13.5 million and fully fund the National Family Caregivers Act. Minnesota using its own private and public resources has not only developed a legislatively approved Alzheimer's Plan but a powerful collaboration that has moved forward to implement the plan. ADSSP funding has been key to this effort as well as enabling Minnesota to implement important evidence-based interventions such as the New York University Caregiver Intervention. Minnesota relies on a network of dementia capable caregiver consultants many funded through the National Family Caregivers program to support Alzheimer's caregivers in the community. Minnesota has dedicated significant state and private dollars to building a dementia capable medical care and community care system of the highest quality. With the national coordination and funding that is being recommended by NAPA our work and that of other states would be greatly magnified and impact many more lives.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, we thank you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your work to forumulate the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Plan, as demonstrated in strategies 2.A and 2.C, which call for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items located under Strategy 2.A are significant, we remain concerned that the essential workforce goals identified by the Council cannot be realized without the investment of additional resources. Specifically, the action items calls for additional and enhanced activities within Geriatric Education Centers (GEC), the Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP), the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program (GACA), the Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral and mental Health Providers (GTPD) program, and the Direct-Care Workforce training program. These programs, which are administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under the Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act, are in constant danger of defunding and have experienced stagnant funding that has not kept up with the pace of inflation, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. To implement these additional and enhanced activities in order to realize the goal of enhancing care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions additional funding must be invested.</p>
<p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the committee continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you.</p>

					The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					April 17, 2012</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, thank you for your work to formulate recommendations for operationalizing the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Draft Plan, outlined in strategy 2.A, which calls for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items outlined in the Draft Plan and the recommendations you have voted on here today are significant, EWA strongly urges the Council to consider the following comments in order to achieve the essential workforce goals identified in the Draft Plan: -</p>
<ul><li>EWA strongly supports the Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation #8 to invest additional funding in multidisciplinary geriatrics education and training programs under Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Action items under Strategy 2.A of the Draft Plan call for additional and enhanced activities within these programs; however, they have experienced stagnant funding and constant threats of defunding, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. Some of the programs authorized in the Affordable Care Act have yet to receive appropriations. To implement the additional activities called for in the Draft Plan to enhance care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions, additional funding must be invested.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Clinical Care Subcommittee's recommendation to increase funding for loan repayments and other incentives for those who study geriatrics and gerontology. We recommend that geriatrics and gerontology be made permanently eligible via statute for federal loan forgiveness and other efforts to boost enrollment in these medical disciplines.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Council's recommendations with regard to promotion of geriatric education offerings and the dissemination of information about Alzheimer's disease, dementia care, and support systems. EWA believes that geriatric competencies and dementia training should be included in training for all primary care clinicians and staff to improve detection, treatment and care for people with Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee's recommendations for health care provider training and for adequate training and compensation for paraprofessional caregivers. More specifically, we recommend that certified nursing aides and home care aides and their supervisors be required to take at least 120 of training, including explicit geriatric care and gerontological content; and that minimum training standards/competencies for non-clinical direct-care workers should be created and that they should be adequately compensated.</li>
<li>EWA urges the Council to consider more specific recommendations on improving access to Medicare and Medicaid funded home- and community-based care services to allow individuals with Alzheimer's disease to stay in their homes as long as possible.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Council's recommendations to expand and increase funding for AoA programs such family planning and social services, research and development projects, and training in the field of aging; respite care; support services for family caregivers that can help reduce their burden.</li>
</ul><p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the Council continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you to achieve the goals of the National Plan.</p>

<p>The National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities (NASUAD) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, as published on February 22, 2012.</p>
<p>NASUAD represents the nation's 56 state and territorial agencies on aging and disabilities. As part of the National Aging Network, each of our members oversees the implementation of the Older Americans Act (OAA), through funds awarded by the Administration on Aging (AoA). Additionally, many member-states also serve as the operating agency for Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) waivers that serve older adults, and in some cases, individuals with disabilities. The Association's principal mission is to design, improve, and sustain state systems delivering home and community based services and supports for people who are older or have a disability, and their caregivers.</p>
<p>The enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) has created a long-overdue opportunity to focus the nation's attention on Alzheimer's disease, and the Association applauds the Administration's recognition of both the vital need to address the many challenges facing people with the disease, their families, and caregivers; and the urgency with which this must be done. Additionally, we find the draft plan's guiding principles, which seek to optimize existing resources and improve and coordinate ongoing activities, to support public-private partnerships, and to transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease, to be an appropriate reflection of the ambitious, yet attainable, goals embodied by the plan itself.</p>
<p>Guided by a vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease, the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease outlines goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network. Consequently, NASAUD respectfully submits for your consideration the following comments and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces.</strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds the Department's efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through AoA. While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies. </strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds states for recognizing the need to develop comprehensive plans to address Alzheimer's disease, but we are concerned that these plans are being conceptualized and developed without involvement from the Aging Network. State agencies on aging and disabilities play a critical role in the oversight and delivery of services that are designed to support older adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease, in their homes and communities. For these reasons, NASUAD recommends that state agencies on aging and disabilities, and other relevant stakeholders, should be involved at all stages of Alzheimer's state plan development.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with the Older Americans Act, state agencies must develop a State Plan on Aging, which is envisioned by AoA as a comprehensive plan document that articulates the direction in which state long-term care efforts are moving, key strategies to address the strong desires of the rapidly growing new generation of long-term care consumers to be served in their homes and communities, and how the state will address the challenges of America's budgetary constraints and competing priorities in today's society. Given these existing requirements, State Plans on Aging may be the most appropriate place for states to describe their short and long-term strategies for addressing Alzheimer's disease. The integration of Alzheimer's state plans into State Plans on Aging would align with the need for a holistic approach to combatting the disease itself, as well as AoA's intent that State Plans serve as valuable tools for planning and tracking all of the state's efforts on behalf of older adults.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services. </strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the Department's approach of expanding linkages between existing disease support and community information centers supported by AoA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In order to successfully connect members of the public with the necessary services and supports, NASUAD recommends that HHS also examine the capacity of these existing structures, particularly those within the Aging Network, such as ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, and SHIPs, to ensure that these resources are adequately funded to meet the needs of this growing population.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that any strategy to strengthen the Aging Network's capacity to provide families and people with AD access to appropriate services and specialized long-term care planning should be implemented in such a manner that does not overly burden these existing systems. Rather, any approach should provide the Aging Network with the necessary resources to meet these unique needs and to develop innovative practices for doing so. In addition, HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies, as well as patient advocacy organizations, and make these tools readily available within the next year for distribution through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD supports the Department's recognition of the potential for the ADRC Evidence Based Care Transitions program to implement evidence-based care transition models that meaningfully engage older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their informal caregivers. Throughout this evaluation process, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider the impact that additional resources could have on the ability of ADRCs to build their capacity and successfully support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.3: Develop an AD-specific toolkit on care transitions. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this toolkit be developed in consultation with state agencies on aging and disabilities, and be available for distribution throughout the Aging Network within the year.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H.2: Identify steps to ensure access to long-term services and supports for younger people with AD.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the proposed collaboration between the Administration on Aging (AoA), the Office on Disability, and Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) to address access to long-term services and supports across the lifespan, and believes these agencies should be consulted as stakeholders throughout the plan's development and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports HHS efforts to give caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner, and recommends that plans to do so include input from the Aging Network. To facilitate the identification and distribution of culturally-appropriate materials to caregivers, NASUAD recommends that within the year, HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally-sensitive materials and trainings that are currently available, and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS utilize its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials and make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS distribute the identified best practices in a manner that recognizes the variance in long-term services and supports systems across, and within, states. Since what may be a promising practice in one state may be ineffective in another, NASUAD encourages HHS to recognize the importance of state flexibility in meeting the unique needs of individuals within each state.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, so it is important that the evaluation of such programs not be limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.4: Develop and disseminate evidence-based interventions for people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement the strategies defined in Action 3.B.3, NASUAD recommends that HHS quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's disease, and their families, have access to successful evidence based intervention programs. There are existing programs that NASUAD recommends HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Older Americans Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging. Funding should also be increased for the programs funded by the Act.</li>
<li><strong>Lifespan Respite Care Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services. Additional funds should be allocated to the Act.</li>
<li><strong>National Family Caregivers Support Program</strong> -- At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems.</strong><br />
					As HHS works to connect caregivers with appropriate supportive services, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the existing capacity of ADRCs to serve as "No Wrong Doors" through which individuals, their families, and caregivers can access available services and programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recognizes and applauds the successes of the VA in providing home and community based care, and realizes the importance of sharing lessons learned from the implementation of these programs across agency and state lines. NASUAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible, so that important information is gathered and shared not only among federal programs, but also throughout the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs. </strong><br />
					Once HHS completes this barrier-identification process, NASUAD recommends that HHS work with federal stakeholders, including CMS and AoA, as well as state and local agencies on aging, to develop and implement solutions to the identified obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts.</strong><br />
					In looking to expand public outreach and awareness about Alzheimer's disease and the importance of long-term care planning, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the successes of the Aging Network in providing outreach and education, such those achieved by ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, SHIPs, and state and local agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement this strategy, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider implementing the Elder Justice Act (EJA), as established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The EJA fully realizes the need to protect our most vulnerable citizens from financial exploitation, as well as from physical and emotional abuse and neglect, and it creates structures and programs for doing so. Though the EJA was signed into law in 2010, it has yet to receive any federal dollars. Without a strong financial commitment to address the growing problem of abuse and neglect among older adults, it will be impossible to fully secure the dignity, safety, and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease. NASUAD recommends that HHS work with Congress to fully fund the Elder Justice Act.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD recommends that these efforts take into consideration the existing framework and resources for legal services that are available through the OAA. Additionally, training should be offered to legal professionals throughout the Aging Network, and the curriculum should address the importance of cultural competence. Training should also be extended to state Adult Protective Services workers as well as to other individuals as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes.</strong><br />
					To leverage existing successful systems, NASUAD recommends that federal and state representatives from AoA's National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program be involved in this collaborative effort.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping older adults and individuals with disabilities, including those with Alzheimer's and other dementias, remain in the community rather than in institutional settings. With a focus on programs and strategies undertaken by AoA, state agencies on aging and disabilities, and area agencies on aging, NASUAD recommends that HUD and HHS work with the Aging Network to identify innovative practices, barriers to success, and solutions to these barriers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em>. </strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community based care systems to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation<em>: Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em>.</strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of necessary health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias, their families, and their caregivers. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families, and caregivers in primary care, institutional, and home and community based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS use existing "No Wrong Door" systems, such as ADRCs, to link individuals to accurate information, resources, services, and supports, in a manner that recognizes the potential need to enhance the capacity of ADRCs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.B.1: Convene leaders from state and local governments.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS include state directors on aging and disabilities in this collaboration, as well as state long-term care directors.</p>
<p>On behalf of NASUAD, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. We look forward to continuing to work with HHS to develop a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that seeks to achieve the vision of a nation free of the disease, while maintaining the dignity and independence of those with Alzheimer's disease, their families and their caregivers. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or Lindsey Copeland, NASUAD's Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs to further discuss any of these issues.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, I am respectively submitting comments on the Draft National Plan (Plan) to Address Alzheimer's Disease. In general, I believe the Plan is well timed, comprehensive, and ambitious and our Department supports the Plan. Accomplishing the Plan goals will require collaboration with many different service systems, and the Department of Health &amp; Human Services will likely face challenges in coordinating efforts across these systems.</p>
<p>While achieving the vision of eliminating Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by 2025 is the ultimate goal, the immediate need is appropriate care for those with AD and relief for caregivers. Further, research needs to be expanded into areas that are supportive to caregiving. The Plan should also address the issues and propose solutions of excess deficits that cause unneeded anguish to both the person with dementia and their formal and information caregivers.</p>
<p>Because of the scope and complexity of needs of those with dementia, I believe it is helpful to prioritize those areas of need. First and foremost, there is a wealth of knowledge that enables clinicians to diagnose and treat persons with memory disorders. However, the greatest need is gavubg adequately trained physicians to diagnose and provide care for dementia residents. This issue isn't new; it has been known for the past 10 years. With only 7,162 trained geriatricians in the country or one geriatrician for every 2,620 residents over 75 years of age, there isn't an adequate supply of geriatricians to provide geriatric educational needs among the US medical schools.</p>
<p>There is discussion in the draft plan about the need to expand and prioritize research aimed at developing new pharmacological interventions for preventing and treating Alzheimer's Disease. There is also some mention about reducing the use of antipsychotic medications for treating the symptoms of AD in institutional settings. Both of these action items are laudable. What is missing is a recommendation to reduce the current widespread, wasteful and in some cases harmful, overuse and misuse of the cholinesterase inhibitors and related combination therapies in treating AD. Practice guidelines for cost effective and efficacious pharmacological interventions in the treatment of AD are available but not widely adhered to.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there discussions are currently being held about the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. Numbers of people are not now being identified; therefore a module asking respondents if someone in their home has dementia and the follow-ups would greatly help us identify the numbers outside of proper care, care-home settings, etc., that currently suffer dementias.</p>
<p>For your consideration, together with the above general recommendations, I respectively offer more specific comments. For example, although the Plan makes mention of emergency rooms, there needs to be "best practice" models that are shared with the thousands of hospital emergency rooms in the US. In addition, I propose these suggestions on specific goals, strategies, and actions:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E</strong>: This priority deals with translating findings into medical practice and public health programs. There should be a separate action item that addresses the shortcomings in the current pharmacological treatment of AD and guidance to prescribers on how to remedy this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1</strong>: This priority is not just important, it is essential if we expect to slow progress, delay onset and prevent AD. It needs to be a collaborative effort that is international in scope (Strategy 1.D) with high level commitment and energy that includes public and private resources and their networks interconnected. Money for research alone will not achieve what is needed. We need to look at past models of disease threats like tuberculosis, polio and HIV that had a grass roots demand for a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3</strong>: This is also essential; we need some fast "wins" through medical research that energize the world-wide community committed to eliminating dementia illnesses. And, in addition to expanding the enrollment of all racial and ethnic populations, we need to have several drug investigations on an urgent fast-track that not only give people hope but the belief that we are doing everything possible to get these issues under control.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3</strong>: ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral) needs to be a more widespread publically funded resource; there needs to be, for example, posters advertising it in post offices, libraries, and other public spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: The lack of adequately trained providers is addressed by dedicating "6 million dollars over two years for provider education and outreach." This is a limited amount of money to fix the national issue of solving the access to care issue with competent geriatricians. Further, there needs to be expanded roles for Advance Practice Registered Nurses in geriatric care.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A</strong>: This strategy has a direct connection to PDA programs. PDA has done some work through the Long-Term Living Training Institute and Direct-Care Worker initiatives around educating and strengthening the direct care workforce to ensure workers are dementia-capable. PDA would welcome additional support in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.4</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to train more direct workers in nursing homes and professionals that provide services in home and community based settings. PDA has provided funding to the Delaware Valley Alzheimer's Association to provide dementia specific training to those professionals that provide in-home care. The training is designed to improve care techniques that can be directly applied to day-to-day care in the home which can reduce the stress and burden on both professionals and family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 2.C and 3.B</strong>: Contained in Pennsylvania's assessment for services for older adults is a 24-question assessment of caregiver status and needs. PDA would be interested to learn what other states are using and their best practices in terms of caregiver assessment instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to improve care for certain populations, specifically those with intellectual disabilities. PDA currently co-chairs the Joint Committee on Aging &amp; Intellectual Disabilities (ID) with the Office of Developmental Programs. The committee was formed to improve services and supports available to older persons with ID by working together through interagency coordination and collaboration. As the number of people aging with ID continues to grow, education for both professionals and caregivers along with proper supports should be a focus and be given special consideration to ensure the proper care for this population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees a great need for increased housing options for individuals with AD. Affordable, safe housing is a special problem during the early to middle stages of the disease for individuals who live alone and do not have informal caregivers to provide support.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 4.A and 4.B</strong>: Public awareness campaigns and pooling/compiling resources should be organized around a single, nationally recognized association/entity related to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, some components of the Plan have a direct connection to PDA programs, such as support of caregivers and enhancing the knowledge of direct care workers. Other components of the Plan such as methods for diagnosis, direct treatment, and research, do not have a direct connection to our programs. However, as I stated above, our Department supports the Plan and, while recognizing that there is no one quick, easy solution to dealing with such wide, complex needs, I feel my comments and suggestions are important for improving the Plan and thereby improving the lives of those with Alzheimer's Disease and their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>I thank you for the opportunity to provide input and look forward to hearing from you regarding my comments.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Congratulations on the development of a thorough and thoughtful draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (National Plan). The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft and looks forward to seeing the final plan implemented. PFCD is a national coalition of patients, providers, community organizations, business and labor groups, and health policy experts committed to raising awareness of the number one cause of death, disability, and rising health care costs in the U.S.: chronic disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (AD) presents a public health crisis in every sense and as such requires an unprecedented collaborative effort to address it effectively. A robust National Plan and the resources needed to implement it are required to assure we achieve, as the National Plan states, a "nation free of Alzheimer's Disease." To help support these efforts, we offer the following comments on the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Research to Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The National Plan includes a solid framework for enhancing research efforts to find ways to prevent and better treat AD. In discussions over research priorities for AD, we encourage consideration of ways to improve care management, care coordination, long-term care, and other aspects of the delivery of care for people with AD in addition to traditional clinical research efforts. For example, programs funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and similar demonstration efforts targeting delivery system reforms should include consideration of patient-centered care models for people with AD and ways to enhance coordination between inpatient and outpatient medical care, community-based services, and long-term care, including managing transitions of care between providers and care settings. The National Plan should specifically recommend inclusion of delivery system research on the national research agenda.</p>
<p>Given the rapid pace of scientific research and knowledge gained, tapping into the expertise from both the public and private sector on a regular, ongoing basis will be critically important to making significant progress by 2025. We applaud the National Plan's call for greater collaboration through Public-Private Partnerships as effective partnerships will play critically important roles in realizing progress in the prevention and treatment of AD, and urge that the final Plan include specific plans to engage public and private stakeholders on an ongoing, regular basis to further develop and implement the plan.</p>
<p>Public-private partnership efforts could prove particularly useful in the development, implementation, and updating of the national research agenda; clinical trial recruitment and development of patient registries; and the development of biomarkers for AD diagnosis and monitoring progression and developing clinical trial endpoints. Public-private partnerships can also enhance regulatory science efforts and informed review processes for potential new treatments by assuring that regulators and other decision-makers are up-to-date on the latest scientific understanding, research challenges, and progress made on AD. These partnerships also offer the opportunity to develop consensus-based best practice recommendations for every setting where people with AD are served to increase quality and efficiency. We recommend that the final National Plan specifically encourage greater public-private collaboration in these critical areas and regularly engage a wide variety of stakeholders including medical, clinical, and public health professionals, patients and family caregivers, community organizations, the biomedical research industry, public and private payors, long-term care providers, and employers.</p>
<p>We also commend the inclusion of efforts to facilitate the translation of research findings into medical practice and public health programs and to educate the public about the latest research findings. We recommend that the National Plan include recommendations that information be presented in ways and through vehicles that are both understandable and actionable to providers, public health professionals, payors, and the public.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Family and Friend Caregivers </strong></p>
<p>We commend the National Plan for recognizing the tremendous burden AD places on family and friend caregivers and the need to do more to support them, including educating healthcare providers on the need to evaluate caregivers for signs that their own health is at risk. Providers' ability to do that effectively, however, depends upon them being able to identify family and friend caregivers. Encouraging providers to document on medical records that a person is a family caregiver for someone with AD or another chronic condition would assist that outreach greatly. Likewise, the ability to facilitate better coordination of care, including care occurring outside medical facilities, would be enhanced if providers noted the name of the primary caregiver(s) on the AD patient's medical record. We recommend that the final National Plan include outreach to providers to incorporate such documentation into the medical records for both family caregivers and the people to whom they provide care.</p>
<p>Early detection and diagnosis of AD will help significantly with care planning and aligning support for the person diagnosed and his or her family. An additional step in early detection should be engaging the person with AD and family caregiver in advance care planning, so that the person with AD can have substantive input while they have the capacity to do so. We encourage the inclusion of this step in your recommendations. The National Plan includes efforts to educate providers, caregivers, and attorneys on AD, disease progression, and the costs associated with care. We suggest that educational efforts also include financial advisors, as the costs of care and long-term nature of the disease necessitate careful financial planning.</p>
<p><strong>Assure Adequate Funding to Realize the Promise of the National Plan </strong></p>
<p>An excellent National Plan is only a set of great ideas without the funding to make them a reality. The Administration's recent announcement of additional funding for AD research and support for people with AD and their families represents a good start, but much more will be needed to implement the National Plan. One near-term opportunity is assuring better coordination of clinical care with community resources at the state and local level. States and communities should be supported to facilitate this coordination to streamline access to essential services for families and increase the efficiency of the systems at the state and local level. Many states are actively engaging public health resources to address the burden of AD. The National Plan should build on these efforts and those at the Centers for Disease Control to fully engage public health resources to evaluate the AD burden and work to address it. This suggestion is in concert with existing policy such as the Strategic Framework on Multiple Chronic Conditions.</p>
<p>When evaluating the need to devote resources to implementing the National Plan, we urge the Administration and congressional appropriators to consider the significant budgetary toll AD exacts. According to the Alzheimer's Association, AD will cost the United States more than $200 Billion in 2012 with the trajectory increasing to more than $307 Billion in just 15 years and almost $1.1 Trillion by 2050. In times of tight budgets, we understand that finding the resources to implement the National Plan will be increasingly difficult, but given the tremendous toll AD takes not only on those afflicted and their families, but also state and federal budgets, these are investments we simply must make.</p>
<p>We applaud your efforts in the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The draft represents a well-considered, comprehensive approach. We appreciate the opportunity to review and comment on the draft Plan, and look forward to starting the hard work of implementing the final Plan to make a significant difference.</p>

<p>The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) is the national professional association representing the interests of more than 140,000 occupational therapists, students of occupational therapy, and therapy assistants. The practice of occupational therapy is sciencedriven, evidence-based, and enables people of all ages to live life to its fullest by promoting health and minimizing the functional effects of illness, injury, and disability. Occupational therapy practitioners do important work with individuals who have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families, and AOTA appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as it works to implement the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p><strong>Occupational Therapy and Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>Five goals form the foundation of the Draft National Plan: (1) Prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, (2) Optimize care quality and efficiency, (3) Expand supports for people with AD and their families, (4) enhance public awareness and engagement, and (5) track progress and drive improvement. AOTA sees the profession of occupational therapy as a key partner in each of these five areas. Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants work with individuals who have AD and with their families to maximize occupational engagement, promote safety, and enhance quality of life. A variety of skilled techniques are used when working with an individual who has AD, depending on the focus of the intervention, the stage of the disease process, and the treatment setting.</p>
<p>An occupational therapist's evaluation of a person with AD begins with an occupational profile of the individual's valued occupations, roles and routines, as well as his or her current level of occupational performance. Often the caregiver is crucial in supplying this information as the person with AD may be unable to provide accurate information, or may be unaware of his or her own deficits. It is essential to identify the remaining abilities of the person with AD rather than to focus solely on what he or she can no longer do. Some examples include:</p>
<ul><li>Identifying performance patterns (i.e., habits and routines) that can be maintained which will prolong independence and assist with adjustment to new living settings such as a health care facility or a daughter's home. Practitioners also consider information stored in the patient's procedural memory, which often remains stable for the longest period of time in someone with AD. Performing well-learned basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as combing one's hair, is an example of utilizing procedural memory. Practitioners learn what the client's hobbies and occupations are which will help with planning the intervention to stimulate patient interest and active participation.</li>
<li>Determining what type of cueing strategies the individual best responds to, and instructing staff on how and when to utilize these strategies during various activity demands. (E.g., does the patient require a one-step verbal command or does he or she need tactile cueing in addition to verbal cues? Can the client follow multi-step commands?)</li>
<li>Determining the time of the day that the person is most alert to maximize performance with activities. (E.g., if the client's typical routine pre-illness was working at night and sleeping during the daytime, then changing that routine may be challenging. The optimal time for engagement in activity may be late afternoons.)</li>
</ul><p>Other areas of consideration include accompanying conditions such as visual loss, or hearing loss. Education of the caregiver (e.g., family or facility staff or both) is a priority and expertise of occupational therapy practitioners, and the therapist should include identification of caregiver concerns about occupational performance and handling difficult behaviors as part of the evaluation. <em>See</em> attachments 1 and 2.</p>
<p>For a person in the early stage of AD, occupational therapy intervention may focus more on compensation for the loss of cognitive abilities and recognition of remaining abilities rather than on the remediation of deficit areas. This is helpful since new learning may be impaired or absent as the dementia progresses.</p>
<p>For persons in the later stages of the disease, the intervention focus may become adaptation of the environment and instruction of caregivers to promote continued occupational performance, as well as learning ways to minimize any unwanted behaviors (such as agitation, combativeness during caretaking) or complicating conditions (such as weight loss, or falls). Addressing the safety of the person with AD is paramount.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of occupational therapy intervention for someone with AD is to set up a program to promote independence, participation in the community, utilize retained abilities for as long as possible, ensure safety, and enhance quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>In the absence of a cure, this goal seeks to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities by 2025. Toward this end, HHS proposes to convene an AD research summit with national and international scientists (Action 1.A.1) and convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013 (Action 1.A.4). AOTA asks that you include occupational therapy in these events. HHS also plans to solicit public and private input on AD research priorities (Action 1.A.2) and continue clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions (Action 1.B.6). In these areas, AOTA asks HHS not to neglect research on effective treatment, education, and support for caregivers and to study lifestyle interventions for caregivers</p>
<p>Outreach efforts to more effectively inform the public about research findings and results are also planned, and AOTA reminds the department to take advantage of using professional associations to educate members and providers (Action 1.E.3).</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>HHS recognizes that high-quality care for people with AD requires an adequate supply of qualified, culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills and expertise. AOTA notes that the Draft Plan places the bulk of its emphasis on physician providers, when patients will be seeing many other allied health care professionals in the new health care system. It is the nonphysician practitioners, such as occupational therapists, who provide most of the support for patients with AD and certainly their caregivers. The $6 million dollar investment of the Obama Administration for provider education and outreach should include specialized training for occupational therapy, and other efforts by both the Veteran's Administration (VA) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) should include support not only for physicians and nurses, but other qualified and licensed professionals (Strategy 2.A.2).</p>
<p>As far as dementia-specific work (Action 2.A.3; 2.D.1), occupational therapy has a proven track record in caring for patients with dementia and is working with the American Medical Association (AMA) --convened Physician's Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) to develop and manage quality measures for dementia. <em>See</em> Gitlin, L. N., Winter, L., Dennis, M. P., Hodgson, N., &amp; Hauck, W. W. (2010). A biobehavioral home-based intervention and the well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> 30(9), 983--991; Strzalecki, M. (2010). The dementia care difference. <em>OT Practice</em> 15(12), available: <a href="http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx">http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>In examining improved care transitions through Medicare's Community-Based Care Transitions Program and the Aging and Disabilities Resource Center (ADRC) Evidence-Based Care Transitions Program (Action 2.F.2), AOTA reminds decision-makers that occupational therapy has an established role in discharge planning, home evaluation, safety, and caregiving training that is an asset in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and their Families </strong></p>
<p>This third goal acknowledges the important role that caregivers plan in the life of a person with AD: they provide care and support, help lessen feelings of depression and stress, and help delay nursing home placements. To further support caregivers, HHS plans to partners with private organizations to review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations (Action 3.B.3). Occupational therapy should be part of these private-public partnerships.</p>
<p>HHS has also noted that medications, including anti-psychotic drugs, can be used inappropriately to manage the difficult behaviors of nursing home residents who have AD. Occupational therapy practitioners would like to be part of collaborative efforts to reduce inappropriate and off-label use of behavior modifying drugs and agents. AOTA encourages the use of occupational therapy interventions to address inappropriate behaviors without the use of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In order to further its goal of enhancing public understanding of AD and engagement stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by persons with the disease and their families, HHS plans, in part, to work with state and local governments to improve coordination and identify model initiatives to advance AD awareness and readiness (Strategy 4.B). AOTA applauds plans to involve state and local governmental entities to further the National Plan, but we wish to note the importance of involving professional associations at the state level in these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Track Progress and Drive Improvement </strong></p>
<p>Finally, HHS plans to identify the gaps in existing data and pursue roads to expand and enhance the data infrastructure in this field and to make data more easily accessible to federal agencies and researchers (Strategy 5.A). Occupational therapy practitioners are also cognizant of information gaps related to the study of AD, and will be interested to access and utilize any improvements HHS is able to make, particular in the area of new quality measures, participating in new data collection efforts, or more easily viewing improved data sets or links between data sets.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AOTA looks forward to working with HHS to implement NAPA. AOTA's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease are en route via U.S. mail, and additional materials about occupational therapy contributions to the field are available upon request; please do not hesitate to contact us with questions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Page 10: Action 1.B 6: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions- insert:</p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will continue to conduct evidence based clinical trials to test the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and risk factor reduction in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network serves as the foundation on which the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) is being built to serve as a primary source of information and assistance to persons in need of long term care supports and services. </strong></p>
<p>Action 2.A. 1: Educate Health Care Providers: insert:</p>
<p>"Health care providers will learn how to manage the disease in the context of other health care conditions, and about the role of the ADRC in linking people to support services in the community".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In general, persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers prefer to receive community-based long term services and supports as compared to nursing home placements</strong>. Community-based AD care should be routinely referred to in the plan.</p>
<p>Page 15: Action 2. A. 4: Strengthening the direct-care workforce -insert:</p>
<p>"HHS will strengthen the nursing home, aging services and long-term services and supports direct-care workforce through new training focused on high-quality, person-centered care for people with Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert:</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA)</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Alzheimer's Association, Connecticut Chapter, we want to thank you for allowing us to provide public comment on the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p>The Connecticut Chapter is grateful to the administration for making Alzheimer's disease a national priority. We believe the establishment of the plan is a positive step toward beginning to address many challenges, including quality of care, family and caregiver support and the development of new treatments and early detection diagnosis and interventions.</p>
<p><strong>The National Alzheimer's Project Act NAPA </strong></p>
<p>Much of the draft plan focuses on evaluation and assessment of current programs. While these are valuable steps, we encourage the Administration to quickly move from assessment to action for the families touched by this disease.</p>
<p>The plan identifies several challenges that emerged from the Alzheimer's Association's public input process and outlines a framework to begin the implementation process. Ten key issues include: a lack of public awareness, insufficient research funding, difficulties with diagnosis, poor dementia care, inadequate treatments, unprepared caregivers, ill-equipped communities, mounting costs, specific challenges facing diverse communities and those with younger-onset Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The Chapter thanks the President for taking immediate action to fight Alzheimer's disease with the historic investment of $156 million in research funding with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and supporting people with Alzheimer's disease and their families in educating the public and providers. On the other hand, statistics suggest $2 billion will be necessary to find a cure to halt the disease. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and the 5th leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. Alzheimer's is the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure or even slow its progression. Furthermore, deaths from Alzheimer's have increased 66 percent between 2000 and 2008, while deaths from other major diseases, including the number one cause of death (heart disease), decreased. Yet, each of these diseases has received between $2 to $8 billion each for the last few years from NIH. Meanwhile, Alzheimer's has been flat-funded at $595 million. It is clear that research funding has helped lower the death rates for other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The Association is grateful for the administration's goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. However, statistics suggest treatments will need to be accelerated to change the trajectory of the disease or it will triple by 2050.</p>
<p>The plan realizes the need for an adequate supply of culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills, ranging from direct-care workers to community health and social workers to primary care providers and specialists from the point of diagnosis onward in settings including doctor's offices, hospitals, community-based home care and nursing homes. Further, given the complex care needs of people with Alzheimer's disease, high-quality and efficient care is dependent on smooth transitions between care settings and coordination among healthcare and long-term services and support providers. Provider training is essential to effectively detect Alzheimer's disease and caring for people affected by this devastating disease.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's and the Aging Network </strong></p>
<p>The plan provides for HHS to coordinate with states to develop dementia-capable long-term services and support systems and improve the Alzheimer's disease capability of the workforce in their state aging plans. These strategies may include enhancing Alzheimer's disease competencies among Aging Network staff, developing AD-capable community health and long-term care Options Counseling in Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and linking State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen programs to AD-specific training and resources.</p>
<p>Since much of the work required to support caregivers and the direct-care workforce should and will occur at the local level, the state should develop a state plan to tackle Alzheimer's disease. Currently, Connecticut does not have a state plan to address Alzheimer's disease. The state plan would create the infrastructure necessary to build dementia-capable programs for the growing number of people with the disease.</p>
<p>Understanding the enormous stress the disease places on family members and the healthcare system, developing early interventions is necessary to effectively serve and meet the unique needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. A comprehensive assessment and strategy to bring local stakeholders together to address the needs of persons with Alzheimer's disease is recommended on the state level. The collection of testimonials through town forums could be gathered identifying and quantifying the number of individuals with Alzheimer's in the state. The forums could provide the opportunity to elicit the opinions of the general public. As achieved on the national level, an advisory council should be formed in Connecticut. Membership should include: key legislative leaders, the Office of Policy and Management representatives, state agency representatives and community-based groups, persons with Alzheimer's family and professional caregivers, health professionals from hospitals and primary care, residential and community care providers and Alzheimer's Association representatives.</p>
<p>With the multitude of issues to examine as part of state plan development, workgroups can be formed to tackle specialty areas of expertise. In fact twenty-three states have published a state Alzheimer's plan to create the infrastructure to build dementia-capable programs for the growing number of people with the disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association, Connecticut Chapter appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments on the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In summary, the Chapter agrees earlier diagnosis of the disease and coordinated strategies among the Aging Network for long-term services and supports need to be developed on the state level to meet the growing demands of persons with the disease and their caregivers. Finally, accelerated research and funding for a cure is imminently needed to achieve savings in billions of dollars to the health care system.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>We applaud the efforts of the Council and their Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. This Plan represents a major step forward in the development of a comprehensive strategy for addressing the impact of this devastating condition that affects millions of Americans and their families. At Genworth, we see the effect this disease has every day with our customers.</p>
<p>We were fortunate to have the opportunity to meet with Ms. Kathy Greenlee and her team on March 6 in Washington DC to discuss the effects of Alzheimer's and how families utilize care providers and services. At that meeting, Ms. Greenlee encouraged Genworth to comment on the NAPA. I have attached our comments in a letter from our Medical Director, Dr. Bruce Margolis.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important work. Feel free to contact me if we can be of any additional assistance.</p>

<p>We applaud the efforts of the Council and their Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. This Plan represents a major step forward in the development of a comprehensive strategy for addressing the impact of this devastating condition that affects millions of Americans and their families. While we agree with the overall goals established by the Plan, we offer the following recommendations for your consideration, based on our own experience in the long-term care industry:</p>
<ul><li>Under Goal 2, we recommend an additional strategy focused on the creation of a national provider quality database that includes assisted living and home care agencies that are not already monitored by HHS</li>
<li>Under Strategy 2.E, we encourage the evaluation of community-based adult day services as an alternative to home or institutional care</li>
<li>Under Strategy 2.F, we encourage additional education and resources to help families make the optimal decisions about situs of care and potential timing of transitions</li>
<li>Under Strategy 2.G, we encourage incentives based on outcomes for acute care that are designed to help minimize ongoing long-term care costs</li>
<li>Under Goal 3, we recommend an additional strategy focused on strengthening people's knowledge of, and access to, long-term care providers and resources.</li>
<li>Under Goal 3, we recommend an additional strategy focused on the use of assistive technology to aid in the caregiving and support services for those affected with Alzheimer's</li>
<li>Under Strategy 3.B, we recommend focusing more broadly on overall caregiver wellness programs</li>
<li>Under Strategy 3.C.2, we recommend leveraging the lessons learned from the "Own Your Future" awareness campaign as a successful model to help drive awareness about long-term care planning</li>
<li>Under Goal 5, we encourage engaging the LTCI industry for the purpose of leveraging industry data for potential research partnerships that study type of care, how/where care is delivered, quality of care and change in care needs over time. We believe that industry data represents the single largest identifiable pool of information regarding long term care support services and Alzheimer's.</li>
</ul><p>Again, we appreciate the opportunity to provide our insights and look forward to providing more detailed information regarding our recommendations at your request.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, I am writing in support of the proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders (ADRD) that would promote an earlier diagnosis of the disease, improve strategies for long term services and supports, and accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging was created by the State Legislature in 1973 for the purpose of improving the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the single State agency authorized to receive and dispense Federal Older Americans Act funds and is mandated to provide a comprehensive coordinated service system for the State's 2.2 million older persons, giving high priority to those in greatest need. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network, caregivers and persons with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, an estimated 222,300 individuals in Illinois are living with Alzhiemer's disease with a direct and indirect financial toll of $5.2 billion. More than 70% of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease are living at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to assist care recipients with Activities of Dailiy Living (ADLs) than caregivers to other persons.<sup>(1)</sup> Caregivers often help to manage other serious medical conditions in addition to Alzheimer's, and because Alzheimer's and other dementia usually progress slowly, most caregivers spend many years in the caregiving role.<sup>(2)</sup> In 2006 the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Family Caregiver Association reported an estimated 1.2 million family caregivers in Illinois were providing 1.3 million hours of care to family members. As the baby boom generation enters the age of greatest risk for Alzheimer's, by 2025 their number in Illinois is expected to increase to over 239,000.</p>
<p>Thirteen Area Agencies on Aging and statewide service providers comprise the Aging Network in Illinois, which effectively links older persons with needed services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP), implemented through the Aging Nework, provides five basic service categories to family caregivers including: information about services; assistance in accessing services; counseling; support groups and trianing/education; respite care; and, supplemental services.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, 66,132 Illinoisans received assistance through services of the NFCSP. Additionally, 493,313 individuals received assistance through supportive and nutrition services of the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>The proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders contains thoughtful recommendations which address the immediate and long-term needs of caregivers, providers and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Aging Network in Illinois is committed to providing services to Alzheimer patients, their families and caregivers through a number of programs which support the five goals of the National Plan.</p>
<ul><li>Public Education and Outreach: Through Title III-B efforts under the Older Americans Act and Title III-E programs of the National Family Caregiver Support Program the Aging Network provided education and outreach on aging issues and available resources to 6,429 individuals in FY 2011. Additionally, the Department collaborates with many professional organizations to provide education and training opportunities. Examples include the Annual Elder Rights Conference; Senior Expos; Area Agencies on Aging sponsored Lunch and Learn/Brown Bag events; Caregiver Conferences; AIRS (Alliance of Information and Referral Systems) training; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Older Caregiver Training.</li>
<li>Outreach to healthcare providers: Home and community-based resources are critical to ensure that persons living with Alzheimer's disease are adequately and safely cared for in their homes as long as possible and contain the cost of health care. The Illinois Department on Aging sponsors many conferences and workshops for professionals including the Community Care Program/Case Coordination Unit Annual Supervisor Conference convening supervisors from case coordination units and home care agencies; the Annual Governor's Conference on Aging and Illinois TRAID comprised of state and local law enforcement agencies and other professional organizations. The Department also promotes the use of the Administration on Aging's National Alzheimer's Call Center by caregivers and encourages referrals by AAAs and providers.</li>
<li>Expanded support for people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers in the community: The Department has aggressively pursued funding to expand and enhance services for caregivers. In 2009 the Administration on Aging awarded the Department a three year Lifespan Respite grant which has enhanced access to and improved awareness of respite services. The Department has established a statewide Caregiver Advisory Committee which convenes regularly to discuss caregiver issues, share resources and best practices and review caregiver programs and is establishing protocol to implement and effective service delivery system through Aging and Disability Resource Centers/Coordinated Points of Entry.</li>
<li>Improved data collection and analysis: The Department works closely with the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging to collect data for NAPIS reporting as well as reviewing current caregiver assessment tools.</li>
</ul><p>In 2009, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Related Dementia State Plan - Senate Joint Resolution 43 - Report to the Governor and General Assembly." Recommendations in this report are reflected in the National Plan and include:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing adequate staffing levels and funding</li>
<li>Establishing basic and specialized education and training for persons when responsibilities make it likely they will come into contact with persons with AD and related dementias and their caregivers</li>
<li>Facilitate planning, treatment and research</li>
<li>Provide assistance to unpaid caregivers of persons with AD</li>
<li>Determine an effective system to collect data</li>
</ul><p>We must continue to examine our current capability to meet the Alzheimer's crisis and propose action to prepare for and respond to these challenges which include the development of a standardized caregiver assessment; establishment of the ADRC service delivery model; continue collaborative efforts of the Lifespan Respite Program; continue to incorporate consumer directed care service models through the National Family Caregiver Support Program; continue to collaborate with the Alzheimer's Association in Illinois; utilize Area Agencies on Aging and service providers to disseminate information and provide culturally sensitive training and materials to providers and caregivers; assist families and individuals in planning for future needs and provide updates to families, caregivers and providers regarding the latest clinical guidelines and information on how to work with people with AD; examine the capacity of public safety and law enforcement to respond to person's with Alzheimer's; examination of trends in the Alzheimer's population and needs, including assistance to persons with early stage and early on-set Alzheimer's and persons with Alzheimer's and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging and the Aging Network is committed to continue to respond in the most appropriate and effective way to this growing health problem and meet the challenge of providing service to Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers. The proposed National Plan is sensitive to local efforts to support caregivers and direct-care workers and offers viable proposals to support, educate and train the direct-care workforce and state aging workforces.

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association (APA), I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services, the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, and the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop and refine the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Enclosed are our APA comments in response to the draft plan released on February 22, 2012. APA is a scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with 154,000 members and affiliates. APA's mission is to advance the creation, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA is eager to collaborate with the Advisory Council, federal agencies, and other organizations in the continued planning and implementation of the National Plan. We will continue to promote the involvement of our members in this important effort and stand ready to recommend psychologists (including researchers, clinicians, and educators) with expertise in a wide array of areas that are critical to the plan's success. These areas include: cognitive aging; neuropsychological and capacity assessment; evidence-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers; implementation research, public education and social marketing; palliative care; designing culturally appropriate programs and materials; health provider education and training; integrated health and care coordination models; and dementia guideline development.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments, or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of APA's Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>American Psychological Association Comments on Draft National Plan</strong></p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) appreciates that the Draft National Plan is responsive to some of the concerns that we raised in January. In particular, we are pleased to see greater attention to clinical trials to test lifestyle interventions, including exercise and cognitive training. These interventions show promise as ways to improve cognitive health, and may in time be shown to prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The second draft's emphasis on recruiting diverse participants to clinical trials is also important.</p>
<p>The ability to image biomarkers has significantly advanced the study of Alzheimer's. What continues to be missing in the current draft is an acknowledgement of the critical role of neuropsychological testing and assessment to measure changes in cognitive performance. Real clinical benefits for those with AD depend on fully understanding how biomarkers relate to cognition and behavior. It is fundamentally important to understand why people with similar amounts of beta amyloid may have very different cognitive profiles. The National Institute on Aging and its funding partners are urged to support additional research that links the presence of biomarkers with changes in cognition and functional behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1A: Identify research priorities and milestones </em></p>
<p>APA supports the convening of a summit to help set research priorities to reach the goals articulated in the National Plan, and the additional strategies to receive broad input and refine and update research goals and priorities as the Plan is put into effect. APA also supports the convening of a workshop on non-Alzheimer's dementias, and offers assistance for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>In order to clarify the types of research being discussed, APA suggests the following wording changes - with underlined text to be added and struck-through text to be deleted: </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will expand clinical trials on pharmacologic and <s>non-pharmacologic</s> <u>behavioral</u> ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: APA prefers that behavioral studies be given their own name, and that they not be defined only by whether they include a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>"Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular, cellular, <u>and cognitive</u> mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention. "</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Certainly molecular and cellular work is vitally important. However, an 'integrated interdisciplinary basic science agenda' for Alzheimer's must also include basic cognitive and behavioral research.</p>
<p><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Identifying <u>and linking</u> <s>imaging</s> biomarkers <u>and behavioral/cognitive markers</u> in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Biomarker research is tremendously important, but it is neuropsychological and cognitive measures that enable scientists to link biomarkers to observable clinical symptoms. Biomarker research advances are leading to the ability to diagnose and track AD, but findings cannot be considered complete in the absence of behavioral data. Therefore, the two areas of research should be linked in the plan's language.</p>
<p>Current research demonstrates that neuropsychological measures function well as diagnostic, prognostic, and disease progression indicators (Blacker et al., 2007; Gomar et al., 2011; Jacobs et al., 1995; Tabert et al., 2006). Cognitive measures are critical in the practical and operational (not theoretical) level within all three recognized stages of AD -- pre-clinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia -- in recently updated diagnostic guidelines by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association. Therefore, cognitive measures hold the promise of identifying people at the highest risk of developing AD up to 20 years or more before the disease is diagnosed, and are the best measures of potential impact of interventions on disease progression. Particularly as treatments are worked into preclinical phases of AD, improvements in the sensitivity of the cognitive measures to reliable change over time is critically important.</p>
<p>Recent studies in 2010 and 2011, many using ADNI data, have shown that neuropsychological measures are more accurate, earlier predictors of progression to AD when compared to MRI, FDG-PET, and amyloid imaging (Gomar et al., 2011). There is considerable promise in broadening and improving the measurement of cognitive markers of AD. Every piece of the expansion and improvement of AD research will require good (and better) cognitive assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </em></p>
<p>"The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease includes healthcare and long-term services and supports providers such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, <u>neuropsychologists</u>, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants, who provide care at home or in long-term care facilities. These providers need accurate information about caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease including the benefits of early diagnosis and how to assist caregivers. Physicians need information on how to implement the "detection of any cognitive impairment" requirement in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit included in the Affordable Care Act. Major efforts by both VA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act, support geriatric training for physicians, nurses, <s>and other health workers."</s> <u>social workers, psychologists, dentists, pharmacists, counselors, and allied health professionals</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: We believe it is important as this plan will direct future efforts and funding in this area, that all geriatric disciplines be explicitly mentioned. Psychologists, social workers, and other health care providers play an integral role in VA interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Accordingly, they are included in the ACA expanded training provisions, and are listed on the BHPR website.</p>
<p><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools </em></p>
<p>"The Affordable Care Act created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. 'Detection of any cognitive impairment' must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment and risk for dementia," <u>and to determine the need for referral for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Neuropsychological evaluation remains a critical component of differential diagnostic methods in discriminating neurodegenerative changes from normal age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are related to psychiatric conditions or medical morbidities, and other related disorders. Neuropsychological measures are accurate, early predictors of progression to AD and provide useful information to individuals with dementia and their families regarding the functional capacities of the individual and potential impact of interventions on disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>"Most of the public is aware of Alzheimer's disease; more than 85 percent of people surveyed can identify the disease and its symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is also one of the most-feared health conditions. Yet there are widespread and significant public misperceptions about the <u>prevention</u>, diagnosis, <u>disease management</u>, and treatment." <u>In addition, there is a lack of public understanding of the differences between normal age-related cognitive change and pathological change</u>.</p>
<p><u>These misperceptions can lead both to delayed diagnosis when family members falsely attribute behavioral and memory issues to normal aging and to faulty diagnosis and harmful avoidance behaviors when families become paralyzed with concern about the stigma and decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. Both misconceptions can prevent families from obtaining needed and appropriate supports. They can also lead to inaction in adopting health promoting behaviors such as physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and refraining from smoking, which may prevent or slow any disease process</u>. "Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal because it forms the basis for advancing the subsequent goals of the National Plan. A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease will help engage stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by people with the disease and their families."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Two top tier messages of this campaign should be: 1) AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging; and 2) there are modifiable risk factors for AD (including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity) AND actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. A recent study (Barnes et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>4.A: Educate the public about <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease </em></p>

<p>The American Health Care Association (AHCA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease published in <em>Federal Register</em> Volume 77, Number 37, pages 11116 - 11117 (February 24, 2012).</p>
<p>AHCA represents nearly 11,000 non-profit and proprietary facilities dedicated to continuous improvement in the delivery of professional and compassionate care provided daily by millions of caring employees to 1.5 million of our nation's frail, elderly and disabled citizens who live in long term and post-acute care facilities. We are most interested in this plan since we care for many people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. According to the <strong>AHCA Nursing Facility Patient Characteristics Report, March 2012</strong>, almost 48% of all nursing facility residents across the U.S. are identified as having some form of dementia, while the <strong>March 2012 AHCA Nursing Facility Operational Characteristics Report</strong> indicates that 71% of all special care beds in nursing facilities today are dedicated to care for persons with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>AHCA supports the national plan's guiding principles, goals, strategies and actions and believes the plan is timely, and when executed, will produce a better understanding of the disease and the prevention strategies, care and resources that will be required to care for people living with dementia. Since we are in agreement with the national plan and find it to be comprehensive, we offer only a few comments for your consideration.</p>
<p>The plan identifies that it is often difficult to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in terms of clinical presentation and diagnosis. AHCA would like to see this statement expanded to also include the importance of distinguishing undiagnosed psychiatric disease and characteristics, like behavioral symptoms, from Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI), the nation's largest mental health organization formed in 1979, the nation's mental health system has been and continues to be in crisis. NAMI grades states in their provision of mental illness (MI) services and rates the nation as a "D" (an average of all the states). Services found lacking include the number of psychiatrists, treatment services, and community-based supports -<a href="http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009">http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, David Grabowski, PhD from Harvard Medical School looked at MI and Dementia in nursing homes. Grabowski found that between 1960 and 1970, states closed and downsized psychiatric hospitals. As a result, many states were ill equipped to provide community service alternatives and nursing homes became the "de facto" treatment destination for people with MI. Grabowski cites findings indicating that in 2005, 12% of persons newly admitted to nursing homes had dementia, 19% had MI and 6% had both MI and dementia and the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) process, instituted in nursing homes with OBRA in 1987, was not effective at ensuring appropriate placement and treatment of persons with MI - <a href="http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf">http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The NAMI and Grabowski findings are concerning in that nursing home providers often admit individuals with undiagnosed MIs due to the lack of state MI services. These individuals may present with behavior problems that are often mischaracterized as symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and in some cases, represent both dementia and MI and raise important care issues that need to be addressed. Considering this, AHCA recommends that the national Alzheimer's plan, particularly Goal 1, Strategy 1.A related to research priorities, address the prevalence of undiagnosed MI in nursing homes, ways to distinguish undiagnosed MI from Alzheimer's, and best practices for treating individuals living with both dementia and MI.</p>
<p>Finally, the national plan identifies the need to monitor the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes (Goal 2, Strategy 3.D). AHCA is in agreement with the strategy's focus. One of our four priority goals as part of our Quality Initiative is for our members to safely decrease the off-label use of antipsychotics by 15% by the end of 2012. Given that many individuals admitted to nursing facilities are already on these drugs, reduction in off-label use of antipsychotics in nursing facilities will be more successful if attention is also given to reducing off-label prescribing in the hospital and in the community. It is important for all settings of care that provide services to the elderly to monitor and report their rates of off-label use of antipsychotic drugs. Expanding the scope of monitoring will help to more consistently and effectively detect and eliminate inappropriate uses of these drugs and help reduce antipsychotic drug prevalence in nursing facilities. AHCA recommends that the national plan, Action 3.D.2, be expanded to all healthcare settings.</p>
<p>AHCA welcomes the opportunity to work with HHS on future discussions and planning related to addressing Alzheimer's disease and on any further development and refinement of strategies and actions to improve and monitor care. We thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments.</p>

<p>The Arc is a membership organization of over 700 state and local chapters made up of people with intellectual, developmental and other disabilities, their families, friends, interested citizens and professionals. The Arc has represented individuals with the most significant disabilities for over 60 years.</p>
<p>The Arc is particularly interested in the Council's Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease since the disease has special significance for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Arc was pleased that the draft plan made reference to people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Strategy 2.H. However, we believe that the interests of people with ID should be infused throughout the plan rather than addressed in just two bullet points.</p>
<p>The Arc endorses the comments submitted to the Council by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (ntg). Each of the numerous immediate, near-term, and long-term recommendations for priority actions outlined in the draft plan pertains to individuals with (ID). The needs of people with ID apply to all areas addressed in the draft plan - research, early identification, training of practitioners, support for family caregivers, community-based supports and services, and data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>People with ID are living longer and the number of individuals who have Alzheimer's disease and ID likely will increase. It is incumbent on the Advisory Council to ensure that our nation's public health system is prepared.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering our input. Please contact The Arc if we may provide additional information.</p>

<p>The Iowa Department on Aging is encouraged by the initiation of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. A diagnosis of, or in many cases just a discussion about Alzheimer's disease or related dementia can trigger a sense of fear, foreboding and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's plan has the potential to greatly improve and enhance the current system and help improve the quality of life and quality of care for both people diagnosed and their caregivers. But without adequate funding attached to the proposed goals, we are concerned that systems change is not possible.</p>
<ol><li>To effectively create a system to enhance quality care and efficiency we believe the Plan should dictate minimum standards including, but not limited to the following:
<ul><li>An increased number of hours of education and training required for health care professionals and other disciplines who come in contact with people diagnosed with dementia.</li>
<li>Physician training programs that stress the importance of early detection and diagnosis.</li>
<li>Create and implement dementia unit requirements that include specially trained activity personnel, increased daily programming and adequate social work staff to meet the needs of people living in long-term care facilities.</li>
<li>Dementia care offered in hospitals must include staff with dementia training and enough staff to properly care for patients with a dementia diagnosis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expand patient and family support by enhancing existing systems.
<ul><li>Strengthen the National Family Caregiver Program to ensure that specialists are dementia capable and can provide education, referral and resource information and support to family caregivers who are caring for a person with dementia.</li>
<li>Strengthen the Lifespan Respite Program by providing adequate funds for respite care for people with dementia. Statistics show that access to respite care has a definite impact on the length of time a person can be cared for at home.</li>
<li>Provide access to evidence based programs that demonstrate effective support to all caregivers of people experiencing dementia</li>
<li>Increase psychosocial interventions for the caregiver and care receiver that offer support and assistance for people in home and community based programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enhance public awareness and engagement through an organized, funded campaign to assist the general public in:
<ul><li>Understanding the importance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment.</li>
<li>Understanding the importance of future planning</li>
<li>Becoming knowledgeable about long term living and community support services that are available in local communities
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>The Iowa Department on Aging believes that a nationally funded and coordinated effort is needed to enhance care, expand caregiver support and increase awareness and we support the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>Please see below for my feedback on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. I am a gerontological clinical social worker with over ten years experience in the field of dementia care. I was formerly the Director of Social Services at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, and now I am a doctoral candidate who teaches and conducts research on dementia care at Columbia University School of Social Work.</p>
<p>Congratulations on creating such a progressive plan of action. I hope that my feedback is of value. I would be delighted to get involved in any of the efforts related to finalizing this national plan or taking action on any of the activities outlined within the plan. Please contact me with any questions, comments, or concerns.</p>
<p>Positive Feedback:</p>
<ul><li>The plan is overwhelmingly comprehensive in breadth of scope and depth of detail.</li>
<li>The lists of challenges and guiding principles for the national plan are thoughtfully crafted and easily justified.</li>
<li>This plan looks to make substantial achievements toward fulfilling the objectives of NAPA with both immediate and long-range potential benefits to our citizens.</li>
<li>The inclusion of diverse stakeholders' input, as well as plans to coordinate efforts across federal agencies, shows dedication to setting realistic priorities and working toward meaningful outcomes.</li>
</ul><p>Constructive Criticism:</p>
<p>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</p>
<ul><li>The professions identified in this Action Statement are surely appropriate targets of the relevant activities, but the exclusion of the social work profession is a major oversight. This oversight is not repeated in Action 2.A.3 on dementia-specific guidelines and curricula, which shows some acknowledgement on the part of NAPA representatives of the value of a competent social work workforce. Social workers are integral members of the professional care teams in every setting and program of health, mental health, and aging services. They perform essential roles which are crucial to the successful delivery of those services, and this is especially true in the context of the multidimensional, bio-psycho-social domains of need in dementia care. Look to the work of the John A. Hartford Foundation's Geriatric Social Work Initiative for information on the importance of shoring up for a gerontologically-competent social work workforce, as well as for models of successful workforce development.</li>
</ul><p>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</p>
<ul><li>The Action Statement suggests a plan for HHS to seek input from public and private entities to complete this activity, but it does not detail a process for identifying or selecting providers of such input. With regard to collecting social work guidelines and curricula, I gladly offer my assistance. There are few such guidelines on social work practice in dementia care, and even fewer curricula. However, this is truly my area of expertise, I have lists of the few resources available, I have developed a graduate social work course exclusively on dementia, and I know of several other experts who would also be willing to assist in this effort.</li>
</ul><p>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</p>
<ul><li>The direct-care workforce includes both those who work in private homes and those who work in facilities, yet this Action Statement is focused exclusively on nursing home personnel. Failure to include home health and home care personnel in this effort would be a tremendous oversight. The preferred location of care for nearly all citizens is their own home, the quality of home care services is known to be inadequate for the general population, and to date there are no research studies which have attempted to examine appropriate home care service models, training protocols, patient and family outcomes, and worker outcomes related to dementia care in the home environment. The home health care and home care industries must be strengthened if we are to avoid a crisis in care. Federal money and coordinated efforts among federal and state agencies, and private industry stakeholders, must be dedicated to addressing improvements in the quality of home care services for individuals living with dementia.</li>
</ul><p>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</p>
<ul><li>The importance of reducing the abuse, neglect and exploitation of individuals with dementia cannot be overstated. Toward this end, the Action Statement should be revised to call specific attention to the need to educate District Attorneys and Assistant District Attorneys about responding to charges brought against alleged perpetrators as a result of police and Protective Services investigations. This is particularly important for victims with dementia who lack the capacity, and often the availability of capable advocates, necessary for seeking justice and protection. For example, financial exploitation charges filed by Protective Service agents are rarely addressed by District Attorneys, and, as a result, the perpetrators are not brought to justice and the elders' funds are not restored.</li>
<li>Adult Protective Service programs are generally overwhelmed and understaffed. Certain states have taken the lead in developing more highly effective programs for dealing with elder mistreatment, such as the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs which supports programs for Elder Protective Services and Elders at Risk. These elder-specific programs should be required in each state. In addition, all Protective Services agents should have access to dementia-specific education. When the victims of elder abuse are individuals with dementia, their vulnerabilities are unique, the investigations are additionally complex, and the intervention options are distinct.</li>
</ul><p>Action 3.E.2: Examine patterns of housing and services</p>
<ul><li>Efforts to understand professional care services must now look beyond simple profiles of service availability and use in order to study the effectiveness and efficiency of the services. Access and use of a service are important issues to measure, but the quality of care provided by these formal service systems (most of which are regulated at the state level) needs to be studied as well. Anecdotal and research-based evidence continually suggests that consumers do not receive adequate care, families are not relieved of their burdens by using formal care services, and community-based services do not effectively postpone nursing home placement. Investments in improved quality of care would likely result in significant long-range savings due to reduced worker turnover, delayed family burnout, delayed nursing home placements, reduced hospitalizations for avoidable medical and behavioral complications, and fewer transitions between care settings.</li>
<li>This Action Statement calls for an in-depth analysis of the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities, but should also include the further development and analysis of the National Home and Hospice Care Survey.</li>
</ul><p>General concern-</p>
<ul><li>This plan does not provide adequate attention to mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers. Dementia frequently co-occurs with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems. Recognizing and treating these conditions plays a vital role in improving patients' cognitive functioning as well as the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.</li>

<p>We, Drs. Matthew P. Janicki and Seth M. Keller, are the co-chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. On behalf of the National Task Group, we wish to make our thoughts and recommendations available to the Advisory Council with respect to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To complement the National Alzheimer's Plan Act process, the National Task Group was convened and produced a report titled, "<strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em></strong>", which was designed, in part, to develop and enhance community care options for aging adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The National Task Group also issued the "<strong><em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em></strong>" as part of this report. The National Task Group issued this Action Plan in January 2012 in the hopes that it would promote better understanding of how adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities age and how dementia, in particular, affects them.</p>
<p>We note that the issues we identified in the National Task Group's report, which was submitted to the Advisory Council at its January 17th meeting, has many parallels with those raised in the Draft Plan. Our report summarized and addressed some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Our report also noted that older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have special needs that at times require different actions than those provided for people in the general population. Alzheimer's disease affects everyone; but not everyone can be treated the same way when they are affected by this disease.</p>
<p>We have submitted these comments in order to clarify and provide feedback to the Advisory Council regarding its Draft Plan. First, we would like to note that the National Task Group is pleased that the Draft Plan contains mention of intellectual disabilities (in Strategy 2.H) as this group of Americans is composed of a significant number of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for Alzheimer's disease. We also would like the Draft Plan to contain at least mention of some general issues that we have raised in our Report and also have more elaboration on some key specific issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Given this, we'd like to offer the following comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Missing mention of the significance of Down syndrome in Alzheimer's research</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the text under Goal 1, neglects mention of the research with respect to the needs of people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certainly sustained research is warranted to better understand the etiology and course of dementia in this group of individuals. Additionally, notwithstanding the competing beliefs of whether research involving people with Down syndrome will benefit general research into the nature and cause of Alzheimer's disease, we feel that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will certainly benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down syndrome also demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. We would like to emphasize that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention that given the high risk of Alzheimer's disease among adults with Down syndrome, there is the continued need for focused basic and treatment research involving people with Down syndrome -- and this should be included under Goal 1. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>We note with satisfaction that the Advisory Council's Draft Plan recognized the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). However, we would like to recommend that mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities receive mention earlier in this section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. We would like to see the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Further, under the Strategies noted under Goal 2, it is important to propose that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only look into improvements of care for this specific population, but also, and perhaps more importantly, increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities earlier in the second section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</em></strong></p>
<p>Under Strategy 2.B, we would also like to recommend that mention be made of the challenges of carrying out effective screening and diagnoses for dementia among most individuals with intellectual disabilities due to their inherently varying abilities and cognitive functions. When nationally applicable instrumentation is developed or recommended it would be highly beneficial to make mention in the Draft Plan of the need for specialized screening instruments for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The National Task Group is currently undertaking the development of such an administrative screen, which would have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population. Recognition of this special need and work by the National Task Group would go far to gain acceptance of a regularized screen applicable to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We also would recommend -- adding text under Strategy 2.E -- that the notion that community care, as noted in the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, be the paramount means of long-term 'dementia capable' care delivery. We note specifically the growing evidence-based research that is supporting the inclusion of small group homes -- as a viable assisted living model -- and their role as a potentially powerful alternative care setting for people with dementia, and in particular those with lifelong disabilities. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with certain intellectual disabilities and that any national guidelines produced contain this consideration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also strongly recommend the consideration of the use of small group homes for the community 'dementia capable' care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia as backed by evidence-based research in the intellectual disabilities field.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>As many adults with intellectual disabilities and in particular those with Down syndrome remain in their family homes living with their parents or other family caregivers as they grow older, it is crucial that under Goal 3 inclusion of the challenges faced by these caregivers -- when providing care-at-home to their relatives with intellectual disabilities and dementia -- be given due mention. These 'life-long caregivers' warrant special attention in the Draft Plan as they are providing an important and crucial bulwark against costly institutionalization and oft-times inappropriate admissions to long-term care facilities. They are also often vexed by emerging symptoms of dementia in their adult children who have successfully mastered many general activities of daily living and now are manifesting decline. Special mention to the situations of these lifelong caregivers should be made in the Draft Plan. In this context, the National Task Group also recommends that Strategy 3.C.1. be amended to recognize that in many settings concerned with adults with intellectual disabilities, decisions are often made by proxy (and not by 'middle-aged adults') and that adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs. Thus, consideration should be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the enhanced public education resources related to intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Under Goal 4, we strongly recommend including the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities under public education campaigns and that the greater coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector should get mention. As the state developmental disabilities authorities (agencies) are instrumental in helping organize state functions and programs with respect to intellectual and developmental disabilities it would be extremely beneficial to include these entities (and state developmental disabilities planning councils) in any public education efforts at the state level. Also, education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. As there are health care disparities, an aggressive education campaign should involve universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists as it relates to cognitive and functional disability and its detrimental effect on caregivers and quality of life of the individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The National Task Group recognizes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. Given this, we are very pleased that the Advisory Council recognized the import of the special challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this group in Strategy 2.H. We would hope for those adults with intellectual disabilities currently affected by dementia and those in the next generation who may be affected (as the timeline for the NAPA process encompasses the next 13 years) that the Advisory Council will recognize other areas of inclusion of the specific issues affecting individuals with intellectual disabilities within the Draft Plan and accept our recommendations for additional areas of mention and focus.</p>
<p>We trust the our comments and recommendations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are provided -- as the collective concerns and thoughts of a significant body of professionals, scientists, administrators, family caregivers and advocates, and persons personally affected by dementia -- who are represented by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy. I have signed onto a letter drafted by Michael Friedman, MSW and signed on by the vast majority of members of a group of experts assembled in December of 2011, in Washington DC, by SAMHSA, to inform them of the psychosocial, mental health and behavioral issues, concerns and strategies that should be included in the NAPA plan. We are all disappointed that few, if any of our input has been included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>I support everything in the letter from the group but would add the following two comments:</p>
<ol><li>Not only do we need more research on psychosocial interventions, but also on creative engagement interventions. There is an increasing number of successful art and creativity programs (Stagebridge, Kairos Dance, TimeSlips, SPARK, Art Care, Memories in the Making) for persons with dementia, that are making a difference in the quality of life not only for the person, but also for the caregivers. We all know that most aggressive or violent behavior in persons with dementia is behavior that is trying to communicate something else besides aggression; most often pain, boredom, grief, loneliness or urgency of personal body functions. As we develop relationships with people with dementia, we learn their language and can anticipate their unspoken needs by learning what they are communicating to us. Creative engagement and art programs can provide fun and adult-like experience that help us to hear the voices of those with dementia and to avert disaster before it happens.</li>
<li>I would also add that in searching for alternatives to nursing homes for those with Alzheimer's disease, consider the thousands of adult day health care programs that are providing creative and psychosocial interventions, as well as nursing care to over 260,000 participants and family caregivers. ADS have become a preferred platform for chronic disease management with much higher percentages of care provided for hypertension, physical disability, cardiovascular disease, mental illness and developmental disability. (Metlife, 2010). These are all medical issues that compound the care of persons with Alzheimer's disease. According to this national survey, conducted in 2010, by The Ohio State University and funded by MetLife Mature Market Institute, the adult day centers are leaders in community based care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. (over 75% of centers offer cognitive and memory training programs, and educational programs for Alzheimer's disease).</li>
</ol><p>I hope that you will find these comments helpful in identifying what to include in the final national plan for persons with Alzheimer's in America. We do need research for persons with dementia, but not only for new drug interventions. We need research in these psychological and psychosocial interventions also. We must not ignore the 5.4 million persons living with Alzheimer's disease NOW!</p>

<p>Please accept the following comments on the draft National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders from the State Unit on Aging in Connecticut:</p>
<ol><li>While evidence based research can be a reliable tool, more flexibility should be granted to community providers and researchers to explore innovative and creative non-pharmacological approaches to living with and treating Alzheimer's disease. Our CONNECTIONS grant from AoA and our work in CT with NECC and cognitive training has afforded us with many examples of the positive impacts of this intervention on the quality of life for the caregiver as well as the individual with dementia. Excluding such projects from funding opportunities, further exploration or dismissing them as models because they do not have the full complement of expansive research behind them is short-sighted and limiting to families. Often the most innovative approaches are the ones that afford families a sense of empowerment in combating the disease process.</li>
<li>The strategy area of "maintaining the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's Disease" is critical. The perception of this disease and the assumed burden that families incur upon diagnosis often negatively impacts the delivery of care received by those with the diagnosis. Training medical and legal personnel as well as other individuals in the field is an excellent way to begin addressing the stigma associated with the disease and some of the misperceptions and assumptions that are prevalent. Monitoring and reporting the use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes is an excellent proposed action, as is providing awareness training and education for professional caregivers.</li>
<li>It would be beneficial to incorporate hospice options into any training module offered to families as well as facilities working with this population.</li>
<li>The design and implementation of a national education initiative is enthusiastically supported. We are still struggling with the same level of stigma 14 years after implementing our Statewide Respite Care Program (for individuals with Alzheimer's disease) in Connecticut, and many conversations with our local Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association underscore this sentiment.</li>
<li>I strongly encourage the Plan team to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment before new activities are initiated. Since many states and individual organizations may already be implementing aspects of the plan, best practices should be observed to obviate unnecessary and costly duplication or delays.</li>
</ol><p>Please contact me or Cynthia Grant our Alzheimer's contract specialist at the above email address should you need more information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Comments on Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>
<p>I applaud your efforts at drafting this national plan to address Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving has spent several years of intensive study on the caregiving process, evidence-based programs to help family caregivers living with Alzheimer's disease, and translational strategies for making effective programs widely available to caregivers. We have convened national panels composed of researchers, practitioners, and community members to examine how to enable family caregivers to provide care while maintaining their own health and well-being.</p>
<p>The work of a caregiver is done willingly and selflessly. Many caregivers do their work quietly, invisibly and around the clock in homes, hospitals and other places across the country. We are facing a caregiving crisis in the United States. Our aging population, increased longevity and the growing burden of Alzheimer's disease and other illnesses, escalate the need for caregivers.</p>
<p>Evidence-based effective caregiver support programs in the community are critically needed. Evidence and action must be linked. Caregivers need support through community programs to help them remain healthy and maintain caring for another. The ADSSP demonstrations have provided an excellent base for translating caregiver support programs (originating in randomized control trials), into community agencies to reach individuals living with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Increased and continued funding is needed for additional translational research, specifically more demonstration projects for evidence-based interventions to support caregivers caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. More programs are desperately needed in community agencies across our nation. Critical to start up and sustainable translational research is the knowledge of which programs work in community agencies, the expertise to determine agency readiness, the ability to train staff within an agency, and the ability to provide on-going technical assistance. Translational funding should include monies for these technical assistance networks.</p>
<p>A culturally competent assessment for all caregivers is also needed to accurately identify their specific needs and level of risk. This assessment would enable service providers to match available evidence-based caregivers support programs to effectively address these needs. Ideally, a menu of service options based on identified caregiver risk levels would be available through community-based services.</p>
<p>Research indicates that caregivers who are supported throughout their caregiving journey are more likely to provide quality, safe care to their loved, resulting in an improved quality of life for both. I thank you for this important opportunity to be a voice for the needs of caregivers.</p>

<p>Just wanted to check this through with you. We know we 'informally' presented our National Task Group in Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices' national report and plan to the Council at its meeting on January 17th, but were concerned that perhaps it was not a formal submission and thus may not warrant distribution to the Council and our intent not recognized in official comments submitted to the Council and the NAPA DHHS team.</p>
<p>If that is the case, please accept this submission (with the NTG report attached) as our 'official' submission to the NAPA process. Our cover note accompanying the dissemination of the document is provided below.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with our effort -- it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Plan on Dementia and Adults with Intellectual Disabilities</strong></p>
<p>The National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices has issued a plan for improving the community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia. "This is an issue that will only grow in intensity and the nation needs to address this challenge head on" said Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy on Developmental Medicine and Dentistry and co-chair of the National Task Group. The Group's report, <em>"'My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports"</em>, summarizes and addresses some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>The report offers recommendations for the improvement of services and suggests that its findings and recommendations be considered and integrated into the reports and plans being developed by the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services -- under the National Alzheimer's Project Act. The report notes that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation.</p>
<p>Dr. Keller said that "families are often the main caregivers for adults with an intellectual disability and when Alzheimer's occurs they are profoundly impacted." Such families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. The report notes that many such families have difficulties in providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes pronounced and care demands overwhelm them.</p>
<p>The report also notes that it is important to recognize signs of dementia-related changes early, and identified an instrument potentially applicable to adults with an intellectual disability. This instrument could also be used for the cognitive assessment provision of the annual wellness visit under the Affordable Care Act. The report recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to identify those adults at-risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment or dementia.</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew P. Janicki, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, the other co-chair, said that "generally there is little information on this issue and much needs to be done to make people more aware of it." He noted that the Group recommended an intensified community education effort to enhance the capabilities of staff, clinicians, community providers, and administrators. Further, education is needed to raise awareness of dementia and how it affects adults with an intellectual disability among families and other caregivers.</p>
<p>The report notes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. The National Task Group wants its report to contribute to the work of the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services. Plans are also in place to produce educational materials, develop guidelines for care, and hold training sessions across the country.</p>
<p>The report and its 'Action Plan' are available at these websites: <a href="http://www.aadmd.org/ntg">http://www.aadmd.org/ntg</a> and <a href="http://www.rrtcadd.org">http://www.rrtcadd.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <u>DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</u>.</p>
<p>The Virginia Assisted Living Association (VALA), representing assisted living providers from throughout Virginia, as well as thousands of residents and employees served by these providers, supported the passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. We strongly support the goals outlined in the Draft Framework, but we are disappointed in the lack of acknowledgement of the importance of and the extensive use of assisted living services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Assisted living is long-term care service provider, that offers a more affordable home and community based alternative to skilled nursing care. Assisted living providers focus on the resident and offer services that are unique to the individual needs of the residents to allow for individual choice and help residents maintain dignity and respect. Assisted living is a professionally managed, community-based option for seniors and disabled individuals to use when needing assistance with activities of daily living, including specialized care for individuals with memory loss.</p>
<p>Statistics will show that consumers prefer assisted living care over institutionalized care settings, which is directly contributing to the drastic increase in the population numbers of assisted living communities. As reported in the 2009 Overview of Assisted Living (research conducted and analyzed by Acclaro Growth Partners), more than 1/3 of all residents living in assisted living communities have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or a related dementia. The US Government has evidence of this in its release of the 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities as conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, which stated that 42% of the residents living in residential care have Alzheimer's disease. This number is expected to continue or even increase as the levels of care and the options of care continue to expand within assisted living communities for memory impaired residents.</p>
<p>We respectfully request HHS to acknowledge and to include assisted living as a viable option when educating and caring for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. We also request that the word "patient" be replaced with the word "individual". Below is listing of some of our recommendations of changes to the Draft Framework...</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2. Add licensed assisted living communities to the list of settings in the opening paragraph after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.B Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.C Change patients in the title to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Add assisted living and a transition options from the home to assisted living and from hospitals to assisted living</li>
<li>Strategy 2.E Change patients to individuals and add assisted living to the list of transition settings after "home"</li>
<li>Goal 3: Change the title to Expand Support of Individuals with Alzheimer's and their Families, and add assisted living to the list of care settings after "hospitals"</li>
<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize, respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>
</ul><p>Thank you for your time and consideration of these comments, and please contact me should I be able to offer you assistance in this ongoing Plan.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities.

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>

We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>I was informed by our national affiliate, the Assisted Living Federation of America, that the recently released "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease" omitted Assisted Living from all strategies and recommendations, with the exception of the strategy on elder abuse. We fully agree with their comments submitted on January 20, 2012.</p>
<p>In addition, I am writing on behalf of LeadingAge Colorado. We are the state affiliate of ALFA and LeadingAge. We represent the full spectrum of aging services and senior housing providers, including assisted living residences and nursing homes. In Colorado we have worked with providers, regulators, legislators, consumers, and other advocates to ensure that their are care options for seniors as their needs change over time. We have particularly looked at initiatives to allow more individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders to have home- and community-based options through our Medicaid Waiver program.</p>
<p>In coalition with the Colorado Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association we have spent a great deal of time in recent years educating policy makers about the important role that Assisted Living Residences play in providing an alternative to expensive nursing home care. The state chapter has been particularly helpful in our efforts to increase Medicaid waiver funding for assisted living residences in Colorado. We know that Medicaid recipients have been inappropriately placed in nursing homes when their diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders did not require twenty-four hour nursing care. We also know that demographic projections for our state include a higher than average projection for individuals who will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders. Not only does it not make fiscal sense to omit this residential option from a national plan, consumers and their family members prefer the home-like environment and resident centered philosophy of care provided in Assisted Living residences.</p>
<p>I urge you to include Assisted Living Residences in this draft framework for the national plan. Thank you for the opportunity to provide input.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS OF THE RI ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION (RIALA)<br />
					SUBMITTED TO HHS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					JANUARY 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>.</p>
<p>The Rhode Island Assisted Living Association and the forty eight of providers who are our members supported passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act one year ago. We are pleased to see the Administration is currently pursuing a plan for a coordinated national strategy to address Alzheimer's disease. While the Draft Framework is a good start, we were dismayed to see the lack of acknowledgement of the role assisted living has in caring for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. In Rhode Island alone our members care for 3,500 residents most of whom experience some cognitive loss.</p>
<p>As you are aware, assisted living is a home and community based alternative to skilled nursing care. The philosophy is resident centered and the care is provided to support individual choice and help our residents maintain dignity and respect. In the past decade consumers have shown a preference for assisted living over more institutionalized care settings. The population of assisted living residents with Alzheimer's and related diseases is rapidly increasing. According to the 2009 Overview of Assisted Living (research conducted and analyzed by Acclaro Growth Partners), more than 1/3 of all residents living in assisted living communities have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's or a related dementia. A survey of the top 80 senior living providers by Senior Living Executive in 2011 confirmed that 17% of the total residents served by these top providers are residents living in special memory care accommodations. The 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics released data that 42% of the residents living in residential care have Alzheimer's disease. We expect this trend to continue as many consumers prefer the state of the art programming that has been developed for memory impaired residents in assisted living. Indeed there are some assisted living companies that are dedicated exclusively to caring for residents with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>How can assisted living communities not be part of a national plan to address caring for people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia? The fact is assisted living is becoming the most popular form of residential care and services among consumers. Assisted living is a professionally managed, community-based option seniors and their families can turn to when needing assistance with activities of daily living, including specialized care and service for seniors with memory loss.</p>
<p>The senior living business is growing to meet the demands of seniors with memory loss. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing &amp; Care Industry estimates there are 105,000 memory care apartments available in custom built, appropriately licensed senior living communities. Most of these apartments are part of a special neighborhood within more than 36,000 assisted living communities. About 600 memory care-only communities operate in the U.S. However, due to growing demand from families needing full time assistance with the care of a loved one with memory loss, more capacity is being added each year, but growth rates will need to increase in order to serve greater consumer demand expected in the next five to ten years.</p>
<p>Regardless of the increasing popularity of professionally-managed senior living communities as a care option for seniors with memory loss, both government and private sector reports continue to confirm that assisted living communities are more affordable than nursing homes, and potentially even more affordable than home care depending on the level of need and situation of the family and senior. Additionally, options like offering home care to every senior are not practical given the shortage of healthcare professionals interested in serving seniors.</p>
<p>Social and safety benefits of assisted living communities should also be considered for seniors with memory loss. Studies continue to demonstrate that seniors with mid to late stage Alzheimer's disease thrive with a meaningful and purposeful life. Assisted living communities help create this life for their residents with memory loss. Professionally trained caregivers focus on the seniors' interests -- it could be as simple as singing songs, playing music, painting pictures or holding their hand. What's more, other residents and people are around as a supportive social network for the senior. Additionally, due to the professional and social nature of an assisted living community, more people are around to observe the resident to help both promote and protect his or her quality of life.</p>
<p>I am sure you can understand my concern that assisted living was not included in any of the goals or strategies that referenced care setting for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Assisted living has been and will continue to be an option that can provide not only the most appropriate setting for individuals with this disease but a cost effective option as well.</p>
<p>Assisted Living providers in RI have been huge supporters of our local Alzheimer's Association Chapter, through frequent sponsorships of fund raising events; such as the walk and the golf tournament. Our industry helped create the Culinary Challenge Event that has raised a significant amount of money for the RI chapter. I was shocked to read that, to date Assisted Living has been left out of the frame work for a national plan.</p>
<p>The recommendations below cite some specific places in the report where we would appreciate the inclusion of assisted living.</p>
<p>We also respectfully request that the word "patient" used through out the document be changed to "individual" or "resident". While we understand that someone under a physician's orders is called a patient, individuals residing in assisted living and other home and community based options are referred to as individuals or residents. Thank you for your time.</p>

<li>Strategy 2.A Change patients to individuals</li>
<li>Strategy 2.B Change patients to individuals</li>

<li>Strategy 3.B Add assisted living before "nursing home placement" in both references</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D The use of the term "residential care facilities" in the first sentence is odd because that term has never been used throughout the document. A more consistent term could be "long term care settings". In two places the term "assisted living facilities" is used and the term "facilities" should be replaced with "communities". This strategy should be strengthened to support a zero tolerance for abuse of individual's with Alzheimer's, regardless of where they live. Criminal background checks, educating family members, residents and staff in how to recognize, respond and report suspected abuse and termination of staff when appropriate must be a top priority.</li>

<p>My name is Dr. Steve Hume and I am a member of the Alzheimer's Association national Board. I was also diagnosed with AD at the age of 60.</p>
<p>Feedback: I feel the framework and recommendations to date are on target and broadly cover the important issues.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to see a recommendation directed to Medicare that ensures it will develop and fund innovative in-home and in-community programs and services for persons with AD and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Many AD persons have Medicare but are inelligible for Medicaid. This precludes them from receiving in-home services, respite care and day treatment.</p>
<p>Many families cannot afford these services out-of-pocket. The result is either the caregiver reduces or eliminates their work hours or AD patients are forced into nursing home care prematurely.</p>
<p>When caregivers are unable to work the family suffers, more dollars are spent on welfare programs and the economy suffers as they leave the workforce.</p>

<p>Respite Care Funds for Care Givers:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>Respite Care funds must be made available for those people who lack private resources, funds, transportation and family support. Many caregivers provide 24 hour care in their home with no break, financial assistance or outside help. This leaves the care giver exhausted. Many of our nations care givers are elderly themselves. Caring for someone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia is a full time job. Care givers provide full time supervision, medication disbursements, ADL care (bathing, toileting and dressing), housekeeping services, meal preparation, transportation to and from appointments, etc. Many are unable to work due to the time required to care for a loved one. This depletes their funds.</p>
<p>The respite funds should be used to either place a loved one in adult day care program, hire a private duty aide/home health aide, have a senior companion volunteer come to the home, utilize nursing home and assisted living respite services or whatever community program that works for the Care Giver.</p>
<p>Currently, care givers are exhausted with no relief in sight. Many are depressed and lonely. They are cut off from their friends, church members and neighbors. They are unable to enjoy a quality of life many of us who are not full time care givers take for granted. They are unable to go to church, participate in a hobby or any other social event. Just going grocery shopping is challenging.</p>
<p>Isolation can also lead to abuse and neglect. Most care givers have the best intentions but abuse and neglect can happens when there is stress, isolation, lack of funding and lack of support.</p>
<p>Where there are respite services in a state the Care giver lacks funding and transportation. I saw first hand as a facilitator of a support group the desperate needs of the care givers. Some respite services are time consuming with lengthy paper work required. There may be waiting lists making respite services unattainable when they need it the most. Many community respite services require the care giver to transport their loved one and they are unable to provide this. Or there may be no respite community services with in their community.</p>
<p>There must be state and federal funds available for caregivers without funding to use for respite services. Each community should be looking at ways to keep the patient in the home and provide the care giver options such as home care respite services, assisted living and nursing home respite services and volunteer senior companion programs all of which provides options for the care giver.</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<p>The attached document is a summary of my public comments made on Jan 17, 2012 at the HHS and Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, Services meetings to develop the national Alzheimer's plan. Thank you for the opportunity to publically voice my input at the meeting during the public input session. It was a great opportunity to meet many individuals from both the federal and private sectors who are dedicated. compassionate, and committed to fight against Alzheimer's disease through a national plan of action.</p>
<p>The attached document includes my specific public comments as well a few additional input comments.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to attend the meetings and I look forward to attending in the future as well. The work of HHS and the Advisory Council is to be highly commended.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Minnesota Board on Aging believes the work of the N.A.P.A. Council presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to build a comprehensive national plan to address Alzheimer's disease which has such a devastating impact on individuals with the disease and their families as well as on health and community care systems throughout the country.</p>
<p>Minnesota has an extensive history of work in Alzheimer's disease ranging from the work of such notable researchers as Dr. Ronald Peterson, Director of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center to the Minnesota legislatively mandated Alzheimer's Disease Working Group, which recently developed a statewide plan to address Alzheimer's disease. The Minnesota legislature has provided extensive funding to explore innovative models to provide community supports and services to people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers through Community Service/Service Development funding in conjunction with Alzheimer's Disease Support Services Program (A.D.S.S.P.) funding through the U.S. Administration on Aging.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Board on Aging recommends that the N.A.P.A. Council look at the accomplishments of A.D.S.S.P. for guidance in the development of the national plan. A.D.S.S.P. has provided grants to states to build core expertise in the area of Alzheimer's disease at the state and local level and within both community and health care systems. Over the last twelve years, Minnesota has gratefully used this resource to embed Alzheimer's capability within public resources such as the statewide Senior Linkage Line® and the Minnesota Long Term Care Assessment process. The development of an early identification initiative with partnering clinics and hospitals and engage in one of the first translations of the evidence-based New York University Caregiver Intervention that has a documented impact on the delay in nursing home placement by persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>We urge you to call for restoration of A.D.S.S.P. funding that was reduced by 65% for 2012. It does not make sense to so severely reduce a program that exemplifies so many of the objectives of N.A.P.A. until a program that can more effectively achieve these objectives is ready to go. We encourage you to call for an analysis of the lessons learned from A.D.S.S.P. to inform the design of a new program that builds upon its achievements. Finally, we urge you to call for adequate federal funding to meet the new program objectives. N.A.P.A. provides a unique opportunity to take the best of what we've learned and embed it within community and health care systems to provide the support and education needed anywhere people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers live while it also works towards the cure we all hope for.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Board on Aging (MBA) is the gateway to services for Minnesota seniors and their families. MBA administers funds from the Older Americans Act that provides a spectrum of services to seniors, including Senior LinkAge Line®, Insurance Counseling and more. Established in 1956, the MBA is one of the pioneers in the field of aging policy, information and assistance. It works closely with its Area Agencies on Aging, which are located throughout the state, to provide services that seniors need. The Minnesota Board on Aging's 25 members are appointed by the governor.</p>

<p>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Prepare Minnesota for Alzheimer's Disease 2020 (PMA 2020) collaboration congratulates NAPA on this first important step in the development of a national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease. The Draft Framework presents a comprehensive set of strategies to address this devastating disease that places an enormous emotional and financial burden on individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families and also on the health and community care systems committed to supporting them. These strategies will spur research needed to cure the disease, early detection to permit individuals and families to delay premature decline and engage in planning that can have a tremendous impact on quality of life and provide the support needed for informal caregivers to maintain their own health while providing care.</p>
<p>As NAPA moves forward in the development of the plan, we recommend that it look to the accomplishments of the Alzheimer's Disease Support Services Program (ADSSP) for inspiration and guidance. The ADSSP program is funded by the Federal Government and administered by the U.S. Administration on Aging. Nationally ADSSP has provided grants to states to build dementia capacity within public and private agencies, building a core of expertise that has led to the development of services and systems that have changed the way in which community and health care services identify and support people with dementia and their families. Over the last twelve years, Minnesota has gratefully used this resource to embed dementia capability within county long term care assessment systems, to engage with local clinics and hospitals to identify people with dementia early and connect them to education and support services and to translate evidence based interventions into practice such as the New York University Caregiver Intervention that has been demonstrated to delay nursing home placement by up to 18 months compared to the control group.</p>
<p>We encourage you to build on this strong base by calling for restored funding for ADSSP which was reduced by 65% for 2012. It makes no sense to so severely reduce a program that embodies so many of the objectives of NAPA and the Council at least until a better program that can more effectively achieve these objectives is ready to go. We encourage you to call for an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses and lessons learned from ADSSP to inform the design of a new program that builds upon its achievements. And then call for adequate federal funding to meet the new program objectives. NAPA provides an incredible opportunity to take the best of what we've learned and grow it into community and health care systems that provide the support and education needed anywhere people with dementia and their informal caregivers reside while it is also working towards the cure we all hope for.</p>
<p>PMA 2020 is a voluntary, state-wide collaboration of medical, academic, community, government, business and nonprofit stakeholders across Minnesota seeking to implement needed system change, using the Minnesota legislatively mandated Alzheimer's Disease Working Group recommendations as a springboard for action.</p>

<p>I am a retired aging services professional of thirty years who also is a member of an extended family strongly affected by Alzheimer's disease. I support the draft NAPA plan for its comprehensiveness, common sense and accountability. Minnesota has recently developed a legislatively-mandated report regarding how the state needs to prepare for Alzheimer's that is in essential alignment with the NAPA plan. In my experience it bodes well when federal and state efforts are in alignment; especially when supported by community advocates--which I fully expect to be the case with NAPA.</p>
<p>Now there is an opportunity to see whether the plan is just another document and whether the advisory council can be effective in guiding federal resource allocation regarding Alzheimer's to be in alignment with the plan.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Disease Support Services Program (ADSSP) of the Administration on Aging has seen its funding reduced by more than half. ADSSP has provided grants to Minnesota to build dementia capacity within public and private agencies, building a core of expertise that has led to the development of services and systems that have changed the way community and health care services identify and support people with Alzheimer's and their families. Over the last twelve years, Minnesota has used this resource to build dementia capability within ongoing and separately funded programs and services making them Alzheimer's capable. That capability is now being embedded into evolving state and federal health reform activities within Minnesota.</p>
<p>For the last decade, the ADSSP-funded planning and innovative programming was our state's most significant public sector activity advancing the Alzheimer's goals and strategies aligned with those contained in the NAPA plan. Please review and consider the strong advisability of maintaing ADSSP capability as a key component to realize the vision of the NAPA plan. Work with AoA to build the alignment and accountability to the national plan even stronger.</p>

<p>Enclosed please find the report entitled <em>The Path Ahead: A Framework for a Transformative National Plan to Defeat Alzheimer's Disease</em>. This report provides a series of recommendations developed by Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) around research, clinical care, long-term care and support services, and drug discovery and development for consideration by the Advisory Council as it develops a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>LEAD was created to bring together stakeholders from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community - including government, business, and civic sectors -- to increase attention to and awareness of Alzheimer's disease, its care, treatment, prevention, research, and eventual cure. As you know, the increasing prevalence of this disease and the costs of caring for its victims is creating a grave and growing public health, fiscal and economic concern for our nation. With the goal of changing the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease, LEAD convened representatives from more than 40 organizations to develop strategies and recommendations focused on reducing costs, improving care and preventing Alzheimer's disease. We believe that these recommendations, if implemented, offer our best hope to save millions of American lives and trillions of taxpayer and family dollars in the coming decades otherwise lost to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>LEAD members and participants, including nationally renowned experts representing the full range of voices of the Alzheimer's-serving community, actively supported the passage of NAPA and are now willing to be a resource to the Advisory Council as it moves forward with the development and implementation of a strategic plan. We respectfully submit our recommendations in the attached report for consideration and stand ready to support the Advisory Council efforts as the national plan is developed.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this report, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Sue Peschin, Vice President of Public Policy for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America.

<p>Dear Advisory Council, for the past 7 years my siblings and I have been assisting my mother manage the challenges of Alzheimersdisease. I am a veteran of the nursing/psychiatric field with training in Geriatric Mental Health. When our mother began to show signs of the disease I urged her doctor to do a mini mental exam. At the time she scored below 20 and I believe this was due in part to the fact that she is Spanish speaking only and the test was designed for the English speaker. And I don't believe she comprehended its purpose and mostly joked around with the questions and answers. The fact remained that she missed all the critical orientation questions and her recent memory was severely impaired. Today she remains coherent, jovial and she converses easily. She has some difficulty with remote and recent memory, and item recognition, but she still recognizes familiar faces and is able to do most familiar tasks. She can still prepare simple meals, make coffee, and perform all ADLs. Recently, she has shown signs of new memory formation. These memories are based on new information obtained a month or two prior. The new memories are usually linked to an emotional response, eg; something she enjoys or wants to do. The new memories are formed after she has asked the same question repeatedly and it has been answered each time as though it was being asked for the first time. She has been on a combination of drugs called Namenda and Aricept, as well as the chewable version of Melatonin that only Trader Joes sells. She does not experience sundowning and sleeps 8 or 9 hours per night. She experiences one waking about 4 am when she takes another Melatonin and sleeps until 8 or 9 am. The geriatric mental health training I participated in was offered by the University Of Washington School of Social Work, it featured a wonderful section on a program called the Beyond Love Project. The project workbook was written by Moyra Jones and it is a community based model that can be adopted by any community. The Beyond Love Project utilizes the collaborative effort of various medical and legal professionals, as well a community volunteers to teach caregivers to care for themselves and their loved ones with compassion. It provides tools to assist caregivers in recognizing the stages ofdementing disorders, as well as the limitations and challenges of each stage. I have been working on distribution of pamphlets that are produced by the Dept of Health and Human Services to encourage education and early detection. But I am one person and it is not enough. Our Medical professionals are the first line of defense and often they are not aware of the early signs. My mother's own doctor said to me in horror "how did I not see this? I've known this woman for 10 years." I responded "she presents well doesn't she?" The truth is, like any other disease, the only way for a medical professional to detect this disease is by testing for it. My point here is that a Mini Mental Exam should be as standard as a colonoscopy or prostate exam at 55. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing about the new plan and I hope to be a part of bringing much needed services to my community. In the meantime, I will continue my efforts to bring awareness, education and support and advocacy to my community.</p>

<p>I have been conducting training for health care professionals for over 20 years, including physicians on Alzheimer's disease. It is a fact the thephysicians are not prepared to assess for symptoms of the disease nor able to cooperate with the community health and social agencies on coordinating services that are needed. There needs to be much more education at the basic level through the tele-health programs, especially in the rural areas, on basic skills in assessing for Alzheimer's</p>
<p>The other issue is the importance in establishing a base line for possible early signs of dementia -- i.e. MCI. About 80% of early assessments of MCI usually end up within 10 years or so being "diagnosed" as Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Suggestion is that a baseline, as one does for blood pressure, using a modified mini mental status test be made for the population starting at 50.</p>
<p>Redo it every year when visiting the doctors office -- and compare the changes. If there are changes then further investigation is needed with possibly early intervention using Aricept or Memantine. These have been shown to be effective together the earlier they are administered.</p>
<p>Thank you for the link to express my ideas and concerns</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					September 27, 2011</p>
<p style="text-align:center">By Matthew P. Janicki, Ph.D. on behalf of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices</p>
<p>I am the co-chair, along with Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry, of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. The National Task Group was created in 2010 by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD), and my university center, the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging and Developmental Disabilities (Lifespan Health and Function) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Our charge was to examine the state of practices related to dementia and people with lifelong intellectual disabilities, their families and caregivers, and the organizations that support them, and provide commentary on what needs to be done to further services and practices in the United States related to this population. Our charge also was to provide information and recommendations to the Advisory Council formed under the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>To this end, the National Task Group, composed of some 100 administrators, academics, providers, clinicians, families, and advocates, have coalesced with a number of national disability and family based organizations, federal agencies, and provider representatives to create a report on our findings and recommendations. The report, "'<em>My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected By Dementia to Remain In Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em> " is currently in development and we anticipate having it launched at our next National Task Group meeting in November.</p>
<p>In advance of the release of our Report, it is timely to provide the Advisory Council with some key points from the Report for its use. We have prepared these comments, which I trust the Council members will find informative and helpful:</p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affects adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in similar ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound impact due to particular risk factors -- including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. While mostly the disease follows a typical course, at times some adults are profoundly and aggressively affected. Yet all need the typical types of supports and services usually associated with dementia-capable care. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- believe that adults with intellectual disabilities require the same early and periodic diagnostic services, community education, and community-based supports for themselves, their caregivers, and the organizations responsible for them, as do other adults with dementia in the general population</em>.</li>
<li>Many families are the primary lifetime caregivers for adults with intellectual disabilities and when Alzheimer's disease and dementia occurs, they are particularly affected and need considerable supports. These families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. Many such families are at a loss for providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes progressive and care demands overwhelm them. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased home-based supports for caregivers who remain the primaries for care for adults affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Many intellectual disabilities provider organizations that are the primary resources for residential and day supports are vexed by the emerging trend of increasing numbers of adults with intellectual disabilities in their services showing signs of early decline and dementia with potentially more demanding care needs. In such cases, staff may be unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and may misrepresent or ignore these changes, when early identification could prove beneficial. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased education and training of personnel with respect to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and invest in promoting best practices in models of community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>As it is important to pick up signs of dementia-related cognitive decline early on , we -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and health authorities undertake a program of early identification screening - beginning at age 50 for adults with intellectual disabilities and at age 40 for adults with Down syndrome and others at early risk. We recognize that the Advisory Council may be debating the issue of early identification and screening in the general population. In this regard, <em>the National Task Group</em> has identified a screening instrument, applicable particularly to adults with an intellectual disability, which seems to work as a first-instance screen and <em>recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to begin to identify those adults at risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Most adults with a lifelong intellectual disability live in community settings with support from families, friends and service providers. Research has shown that community-based models of care for adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia include community-based options, such as support for living at home or in small group homes, are viable and gaining preference for all individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. Institutionalization of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia is anathema to the core beliefs and commitments to care practices in the intellectual disabilities field and such institutionalization (via use of long-term care facilities) has been shown to have an adverse affect on lifespan and quality of life. The group home model, where a handful of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia live in a specialized care home, is becoming more prominent across the world. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that these models be expanded and an investment be made into enabling provider organizations to develop and maintain such care efforts, including developing more small community-based specialized 'dementia capable' group homes</em>.</li>
<li>Dementia has a devastating impact on all people one way or another -- including people with intellectual disabilities and the many families, friends, and staff involved as parents, siblings, advocates, and caregivers. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- wish to give emphasis to this point and ask the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to include concerns and considerations for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities in any and all documents, plans, and recommendations to Congress that are part of the work of the Council</em>. The National Task Group stands ready to assist and contribute to such efforts and is pleased that this Council recognizes Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as an ultimate public health issue and a problem to which we collectively need to attend.</li>
