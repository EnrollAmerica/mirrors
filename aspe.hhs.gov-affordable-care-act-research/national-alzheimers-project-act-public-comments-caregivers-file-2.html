<p>I am writing on behalf of family caregivers throughout the United States who are struggling to provide care for their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The National Center on Caregiving at Family Caregiver Alliance supports many of the recommendations contained in the presentation handout and would like this letter submitted for the formal record.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee Recommendations </strong></p>
<p><em>1) HHS should provide Federal Funds to support a state lead entity in every state and territory. This entity would coordinate available public and private LTSS, conduct service gap analysis, identify opportunities for efficiency, and enable ongoing stakeholder input to address needs across all sectors and systems. Bullet point #7: HHS should fully fund the costs of cognitive impairment and caregiver surveillance through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in every state. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: We support using the caregiver module in BRFSS in every state. However, in our communication with states that have included the caregiver module in their BRFSS, not all states had the funding or infrastructure to properly analyze the data after it was collected. Therefore, HHS should also include funding for the analysis of the data after it has been collected.</p>
<p><em>4) Fully fund Caregiver Supports under AoA. AoA currently has a Caregiver Support Program, a component of which can be expanded to better meet the needs of caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: An article in <em>American Family Physician</em>, released in 2011, ("Caregiver Care") focused on the importance of caregiver assessment. In it, the authors noted that the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) received $154 million in federal funding in FY 2009, "approximately one-twentieth of 1 percent of the value of caregiver contributions." Family Caregiver Alliance strongly supports fully funding this program that helps families navigate the many complexities of long-term care for a loved one.</p>
<p><em>5) Assure a robust, dementia capable system of Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is available in every state. Bullet Point #6: CMS should provide guidance to all states on adding adult day services as a state optional service under Medicaid. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: Caregivers in California were faced with the elimination of the Adult Day Health Care program (stopped only by a lawsuit) in 2011 because it is an "optional" benefit in Medi-Cal. Given the nature of caregiving for a person with dementia, especially in its advanced stages, services like adult day programs are not "optional" for caregivers. They are vital sources of respite for families who may also be balancing jobs and raising children. Therefore, we believe that the conversation should focus on how to ensure that every family has access to adult day services. When a service like Adult Day Health Care is considered "optional," it often lands on the chopping block during economic downturns, (as California caregivers experienced in 2011) and families are left to try and piece together alternatives.</p>
<p><em>12) HHS and State Lead Entities should assure that caregiver physical health/ behavioral health risk is assessed and addressed regularly. Caregiver illness and mortality contribute to the enormous personal and financial cost of Alzheimer's disease. The health and well-being of a caregiver has a direct impact on the health and quality of life of a person with Alzheimer's disease. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: While we support assessing caregivers and connecting them with services, we also advocate for a person <em>and</em> family-centered approach to care. While the health of the caregiver does have an impact on the health and quality of life of a person with Alzheimer's disease, the opposite is also true. People who become caregivers face increased risks of depression, stress, exhaustion, cognitive decline, and higher mortality rates. Instead of viewing the caregiver's needs merely in relation to how this will support their caregiving role, it is also important to recognize caregivers and their health (psychological, emotional, physical, and financial) as a separate priority in addition to the care receiver.</p>
<p>Family Caregiver Alliance is grateful for the opportunity to provide our input on ehalf of the over 15 million Americans currently caring for a loved one with lzheimer's and related dementias. b A Sincerely, Kathleen Kelly, MPA, Executive Director</p>

<p>As national public health organizations representing state and local public health practitioners, educators, providers, agency officials, and academicians, we are writing to urge you to ensure that the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease includes public health as a key feature of its structure and implementation.</p>
<p>We applaud the department's effort to utilize the resources of the aging network traditionally drawn upon in dealing with Alzheimer's disease. However, the Plan does not fully engage the public health community at federal, state, and local levels. This risks overlooking the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and specifically the Healthy Aging Program's work. Additionally, states have begun to use their public health networks to confront Alzheimer's as broadly as possible. We believe the most successful implementation of the Plan will be through a population based, public health approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, as your agency develops the final version of the Plan, we urge you to include these critical elements:</p>
<p><strong>(1) A clear statement of Alzheimer's disease as a public health crisis and its burden</strong>. Alzheimer's and other dementias are a major public health issue and will increasingly affect the health and well-being of the population until effective interventions are available. In the United States, 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, costing society an estimated $200 billion this year. In addition, more than 15 million friends and family members provide unpaid care to those with Alzheimer's and other dementias -- care valued at over $210 billion. Public health takes a broad view of health care and seeks to achieve lasting change in the health of entire populations, extending far beyond the medical treatment of individual people. The tools and techniques of public health are expansive in scope and required for successful implementation of the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Addressing the connection between Alzheimer's and other multiple chronic conditions from a public health perspective</strong>. At least three-quarters of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias have one or more other chronic conditions. Yet, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease does not mention chronic disease or multiple chronic conditions from a public health perspective. Additionally, the Plan does not mention the HHS Initiative on Multiple Chronic Conditions, which includes both individuals with cognitive impairment and their caregivers as important considerations. The role of state and local health departments in coordinating efforts to reduce disabilities, improve functioning, and enhance quality of life for individuals with multiple chronic conditions is vital to the implementation of the Plan. Examples of these programs include Chronic Disease Self-Management and Falls Prevention programs. The importance of recognizing, effectively treating, and minimizing the impact of multiple chronic conditions, including the impact that Alzheimer's has on managing other chronic conditions, could be highlighted in Goals 2 and 4.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Surveillance</strong>. The Plan rightly includes Goal 5 to improve data to track progress, but it omits important surveillance and data collection work by the CDC and its state level partners. Work conducted through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), the world's largest telephone-based health interview survey, now allows states to conduct surveillance on cognitive impairment (CI) and caregiving. These data are essential to understand the burden and impact of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and caregiving at state and local levels -- data that does not currently exist. With similar data in the areas of obesity, diabetes, and arthritis, state and local leaders have been able to make impressive gains in public health programs and policies using BRFSS information. The CDC has been a leader in the development and implementation of these questions, with a majority of states now having used or currently using the CI module. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including the states, to ensure that all 50 states have used the module at least once by 2013. An additional action should be included in Strategy 5.A to support the important surveillance work being conducted by the CDC and its partners.</p>
<p><strong>(4) A rigorous, public health-driven awareness campaign</strong>. As written, the Plan either relies on the aging network or does not comment on available public health resources to disseminate and educate the public on early diagnosis, reducing stigma around Alzheimer's, and caregiver services. For example, the CDC Healthy Aging Program has studied diverse groups of older adults to understand communication strategies. State public health officials are skilled in working with aging adults and caregivers, efforts that could inform the Plan. Consideration of the role of public health should be included in Action 3.C.1 and Strategy 4.A.</p>
<p>We appreciate your commitment thus far on the issue of Alzheimer's and on the development of a strong National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The public health community at the local, state, and federal level is vital to the successful implementation of the Plan and to improving the lives of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering our recommendations.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>
<p>There now appears to be evidence that Alzheimer's is related in part to silver filling i.e. mercury. Please see below reference; <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/04/07/dangers-of-mercury-contamination.aspx?e_cid=20120407_DNL_art_1">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/04/07/dangers-of-mercury-contamination.aspx?e_cid=20120407_DNL_art_1</a></p>
<p>Story at-a-glance</p>
<p><em>Studies show that mercury is the MOST toxic heavy metal to your body; this excellent new documentary film, Mercury Undercover, exposes the dangers of mercury contamination to human health and to the environment</em></p>
<p><em>The number one source of mercury pollution is coal-fired power plants. Second position is held by dental practices due to amalgam fillings, which are 50 percent mercury</em></p>
<p><em>Dental amalgams, used for more than 150 years, continue to be used by half of the dentists in North America despite a mountain of evidence they slowly leak toxic mercury into your body, and are particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women</em></p>
<p><em>Mercury becomes a "biochemical train wreck in your body," causing your cell membranes to leak, and inhibit key enzymes your body needs for energy production and removal of toxins. Mercury toxicity can lead to major inflammation and chronic illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease</em></p>
<p><em>The FDA, in partnership with the ADA, have been successful for many years in concealing the dangers of amalgam from the public, but organizations such as the Consumers for Dental Choice are making inroads toward getting mercury banned from dentistry worldwide--but they need your help</em></p>
<p><em>By Dr. Mercola</em></p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to watch the new documentary film Mercury Undercover, which exposes just how far those in power will go to prevent you from learning the truth about mercury contamination from dental amalgam--all in the name of money.</p>
<p>Dental amalgam is a primitive, pre-Civil War product that is 50 percent mercury, still commonly used in dental fillings.</p>

<p>I am Joel S Ross MD. I have provided medical care for over 10,000 victims of Alzheimer's Disease since starting my comprehensive geriatric and Alzheimer's Disease practice in 1986. I would like to present my comments on the NAPA plan. I am a member of the advisory panel of NAPA and through my organization, The Memory Enhancement of America we provide an unprecedented level of care and treatment to all those afflicted with memory loss/mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I would desire to discuss the urgent need to open a demonstration project in our 6th congressional district. This Memory Evaluation and Treatment Center (METC) will provide complete and comprehensive management for mild, moderate and severe stages of Alzheimer's Disease. Funded in part by the a portion of the 83 million dollars signed into law by President Obama it shall include but not limit itself to providing medical/nursing/social/psychological care of AD patients as well as offer physical and occupational therapy; address the many ethical, financial and legal challenges this deadly disease poses to patients, caregivers and society in general. This METC will show cost effectiveness by reducing unnecessary hospitalization, reducing need for emergency room visits, delay nursing home if not eliminate the need for such placement as well as be a center of excellence for all other 434 Congressional districts in our wonderful nation. Pharmaceutical research of the highest caliber testing safety and efficacy of the latest medications in development will be a further extension of METC.</p>
<p>All at no cost to the patient. I propose that Medicare/Medicaid and a portion of NAPA money be used to test this METC concept and in a randomized study using a group of 200 AD patients assigned to traditional (fragmented and inefficient, standard of care) and comparing them to a similarly matched group of 200 AD patients assigned to METC care.</p>
<p>I and my many colleagues and other professional associates and organizations believe quite strongly and will prove a METC is the only place for AD patients to receive comprehensive, compassionate and welcomed care.</p>
<p>My bio is attached for your review.</p>
<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak at the April 17th meeting on behalf of the nearly 5.5 million victims of AD as well as for those who have died from this dreadful 100% fatal disorder.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE UNDATED DRAFT<br />
					NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>March 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>The comments presented in this paper are based on my experience as the primary care giver for someone with Alzheimer's dementia and on a book that I read as part of my research on Alzheimer's dementia. The book is titled <em>The Myth of Alzheimer's Disease</em> by Dr. Peter Whitehouse, a leading researcher in Alzheimer's disease for over 30 years.</p>
<p>Eight years ago at age 60, my wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). She lived at home for four and a half years, and has lived in an assisted living facility for the past three years and nine months. She has had three different kinds of brain scans (CAT, MRI, and PET), been evaluated for vitamin B-12 deficiency, been evaluated for "water on the brain", been evaluated at the University of Virginia and John Hopkins University, seen four different neurologists, and has taken both of the medications typical given to people with AD all to no avail. I concluded several years ago that the only thing left was to ensure that she is taken care of. Not only to pay for the care but to participate in it, which I do on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Dr. Whitehouse's book summarizes most of the experiences that I have been through in the last eight years and confirms my conclusion about care for my wife. In my view, everyone who has a loved one diagnosed with AD should read this book. I also believe that Dr. Whitehouse should be considered for inclusion on the Advisory Council established by the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p>The last part of this paper contains a brief discussion of a grant program through which funding could be provided for the care of people with AD.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL COMMENT </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the goals in the draft plan. I do not agree, however, with the distribution of funding for the goals. Of the $156 million dollars included in the draft plan, $130 million (83 percent) are allocated for research. Only $26 million are allocated for care. In my view, the funds for research and care should be reversed. At some point, everyone with either AD or another type of dementia is going to need care. That is where most of the federal funds and private funds should be spent.</p>
<p>The final plan should include more details for each of the goals. This includes the office responsible for each strategy and the tentative completion date, funds, and expected outcomes or products for each strategy. Without the details, there is no way to tract the progress on each strategy. The plan also should indicate who will provide oversight for each strategy.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC COMMENTS </strong></p>
<p>1. Care</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I concluded several years ago that the only thing that I can do for my wife is to see that she is taken care of. For this reason, I believe that the first goal on Page 6 of the national plan should address care and that care should be the major theme throughout the plan.</p>
<p>I am not recommending that no research be done on AD. Certainly, research should continue on AD, but not at the funding distribution in the draft plan (i.e., 83 percent of the total amount in the draft plan). In my view, the only way to find a cure for AD is to find a cure for the aging process. This is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>2. Use of the Word "Disease"</p>
<p>In his book, Dr. Whitehouse concludes that Alzheimer's is not disease. It is aging of the brain that can be caused by a number of factors (e.g., stroke, lifestyle, injury, or environmental exposure). Because it is not a disease, there is no cure for AD.</p>
<p>I recommend that the work "disease" no longer be used to describe Alzheimer's dementia . Use of the word stigmatizes the person with AD often resulting in depression, loss of friends, and lack of understanding on what is really occurring. Even though the end result is the same (all persons with AD and other dementias need care), calling the condition what it really is (i.e., dementia) is a better approach for dealing with the condition. In his book, Dr. Whitehouse described an approach whereby the patient and the patient's family are told that the patient has dementia and then given help through a team approach. The team consists of the doctor, a dietitian who helps the patient improve their diet, a physical therapist who works with the patient to increase their physical activity, and a social worker who emphasizes the importance of staying connected both mentally and socially. Use of the team approach is more compassionate then just telling the patient they have Alzheimer's disease, and to take Aricept and come back for another doctor's visit in six months, which is what happened to my wife. Using the word "disease" to describe AD implies there is a cure for AD. This gives the patient and the patient's family false hope because, as previously mentioned, I do not believe there is a cure for AD.</p>
<p>3. Ethnic and Racial Minority Populations</p>
<p>During the eight years that I have had direct involvement with AD, I have never read anything or had any experiences that indicate ethnic and racial minority populations have higher cases of AD than the general population. Unless there is compelling evidence that those populations do experience disproportionate cases of AD, I recommend that this issue not be emphasized in the national plan. In my view, it is more important to spend funds on the care of all people with AD.</p>
<p>4. Assisted Living Facilities</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to recognize that a viable option for people with AD is care in a secure area at an assisted living facility. My wife has been cared for in such facility for three years and nine months, and I expect her to continue to be cared for in an assisted living facility for many more years (she is very healthy except for AD).</p>
<p>An issue related to caring for a person with AD in an assisted living facility is cost. Funds are not available from either Medicare or Medicaid for people who receive care in an assisted living facility. In my view, there is no difference between care of a person with AD in a nursing home and care of such a person in a secure area of an assisted living facility. This disparity needs to be addressed. An example of the cost of care in an assisted living facility is the $75,600 annual fee for my wife plus the cost of incontinence supplies and medications. At present, my long term care insurance pays for part of these costs and I pay the remaining part. When my long term care insurance expires, I will have to pay the total costs.</p>
<p>5. Strategy 2.A</p>
<p>Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and emergency room personnel should be included in the healthcare providers who receive education in AD. In my experience, general physicians also need to be educated about AD. All too often, they just want to prescribe a medication. For example, seroquel often is prescribed for people with AD. Every article that I read on seroquel said that it is not recommended for people with dementia. When I told the doctor that, he said they give it to people with AD anyway.</p>
<p>6. Action 2.A.4</p>
<p>The training discussed in this action should be made available to all direct-care workers and not just workers in nursing homes. In particular, direct-care workers in assisted living facilities and those who provide home care should receive this training.</p>
<p>7. Action 2.B.2</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with AD through a process of elimination. In her first visit to a neurologist, she could not pass some simple tests. At later appointments, those same tests were given to her with worst results that the results of the earlier tests. Eventually, the neurologist concluded she had AD. In my view, this process is most likely the only way to diagnose AD.</p>
<p>8. Action 2.E.2</p>
<p>In my experience, the cost of home care for a person with AD is not that much less than the cost of care in an assisted living facility. In addition, home care is much more difficulty for the primary care giver even with the help of direct-care personnel who come to the home. In too many cases, the primary care giver is the one who suffers the most when care is provided in the home.</p>
<p>9. Strategy 2.H</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have not seen that racial and ethnic minorities are affected disproportionally by AD. All people with AD need care no matter what their race or ethic group. The available resources should be spent on improving care for all AD patients instead of focusing on any racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>10. Action 3.D.1</p>
<p>It is extremely important that primary care givers understand the legal documents a person with AD should have. These include a general power of attorney, a medical power of attorney, a will, and, where appropriate, a trust. Also, the primary care giver should ensure their name is on the appropriate bank accounts. The importance of these documents should be stressed in the plan.</p>
<p>11. Goal 5</p>
<p>I agree that it is important to track progress on all of the strategies in the plan. As part of that effort, oversight on all strategies and actions must be provided. Without oversight, there is no way to assess progress.</p>
<p><strong>CARE PROPOSAL </strong></p>
<p>Throughout the above comments I have emphasized the importance of care for people with AD. To provide quality care, funding is required. One way to provide that funding is through a grant program.</p>
<p>To help defray the cost of care for people with AD, a grant could be provided to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home heath care companies, and, potentially, to individuals. Such a program could be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or funds could be provided to a state and they could administer the program. To receive a grant, specific requirements would have to be met. In addition, oversight would have to provided to ensure that the grants funds are spent properly.</p>
<ul><li>Grant funds could be used to.</li>
<li>Develop standards of the care of AD patients.</li>
<li>Develop design standards for new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Construct new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Train direct-care workers</li>
<li>Provide funds to increase the pay of direct-care workers. . " Provide funds to defray the costs that family members have to pay for care.</li>
<li>Provide funds for the oversight of the grant requirements and to ensure quality care is provided.</li>
</ul><p>To receive a grant, an entity would have to submit an application to the agency who administers the grant program. The application would have to contain detailed information about on the facility and the care they provide.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We at <em>FasterCures</em> have been observing with great interest the development of this agenda for some time and were significantly engaged in providing feedback on its precursor, the plan of the Alzheimer's Study Group.</p>
<p><em>FasterCures'</em> mission is to improve the medical research system irrespective of disease area, to speed up the time it takes to get important new medicines from discovery to patients. As a result, our concerns often relate to the importance of tackling problems with the research <strong>process</strong> as well as the science. While we might wish that the language in the Plan were a little bit stronger and more direct on this score, we are pleased that many of the process issues we care about and raised with the Alzheimer's Study Group are reflected in it, including:</p>
<ul><li>Promoting a more outcomes-oriented approach to research, particularly translation and drug development. (The Plan does not, however, offer specific ideas about the changes necessary for this to happen -- e.g. how might this impact the traditional investigator-initiated model of grantmaking by the NIH?)</li>
<li>Mapping the landscape of current Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, not just within federal agencies but by all players;</li>
<li>Identifying priority areas for research investment;</li>
<li>Encouraging and facilitating collaboration among sectors; and</li>
<li>Building patient awareness of and participation in research.</li>
</ul><p>There are other issues we see as critical to progress toward new treatments that we do not believe are adequately reflected in the Plan, including:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Creating shared resources available to AD researchers</strong>. There are occasional references to this subject in a number of places in the plan, but we believe it should be an important focus. Any inventory of AD research investments should explicitly include resources such as databases, electronic health records collections, and tissue banks that already exist and should be shared, and any effort to identify research priorities should explicitly include new shared resources that need to be created.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging regulators in strategizing about how to accelerate approval</strong>. Again, the plan does mention FDA on occasion, but in our view there is not enough emphasis on the importance of this. Approval of new therapies can be significantly accelerated if regulators can be involved in discussions about clinical trials at early stages, so that time is not lost at the end of the process having to go back to the drawing board. The Foundation for the NIH's Biomarker's Consortium is an excellent example of the utility of involving FDA at the earliest stages of research.</li>
<li><strong>Making sure that all existing federal efforts (not just those already specifically targeted at AD) are applying themselves to the challenges faced by AD</strong>. For example, the new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at NIH, the FDA's focus on improving regulatory science at the agency, and the efforts of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT at HHS to accelerate the adoption of electronic health records and information exchange. These are significant efforts by the federal government that will have an impact on the research environment and should reflect the priority the federal government is placing on AD.</li>
<li><strong>Examining the pipeline of clinical researchers in AD</strong>. There is appropriate emphasis in the Plan on training of providers and caregivers, but not on the future research corps. AD already suffers from a shortage of clinicians trained in the complex care of elderly patients, and the shortage of clinical researchers in this area is probably even more dire. Attention should be paid to the recruitment and training of researchers capable of working in this field.</li>
</ul><p>Thank you once again for the opportunity to comment on what we believe is a strong draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We are happy to discuss our views further with HHS or the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services at any time.</p>

<p>I am very impressed by the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (and Related Dementias). It is well written and quite comprehensive from my perspective. But I do have some concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in February 2010. I am her primary caregiver and health advocate. Fortunately, long-term care insurance has afforded us the opportunity to have two very good caregivers thus providing me the ability to work part time as a research scientist at CNA, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). My wife and I have experienced both the classical, traditional clinical medical approach and, more recently, the alternative complementary medical approach. In addition, I am a member of two caregiver support groups: one offered by a Ministry to the Aging at my church, and the second offered by the Alzheimer's Family Day Center of Fairfax, VA.</p>
<p>From this base of experience and education, I offer my observations and suggestions:</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan seems to lack a sense of urgency</strong>. While the goal "to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025" is laudable, the selection of 2025 along with the general tone of the plan does not convey the urgency I believe is necessary. Selecting either 2020, because it's sooner and a nice round number, or 2022, as it comes 10-years after the release of the National Plan and is akin to President Kennedy's announcement in 1960 of manned flight to the moon by the end of that decade, would be better. Both years signal a message of boldness and ambition more so than does 2025. I believe caregivers and family members would be encouraged by such ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>The plan appears to display certain biases that may restrict the search for alternative solutions</strong>.
<ol><li>First, there seems to be an emphasis on searching for "pharmacological" solutions. Certainly, the plan recognizes other approaches, e.g. "While research on AD has made steady progress, there are no pharmacological or <em>other interventions</em> to definitively prevent, treat, or cure the disease" and "<em>non-pharmacological management</em> of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms." But it does not clearly state what such "other, non-pharmacological" approaches might be. This suggests to me a bias toward pharmaceutical solutions and therefore a favoring of the pharmaceutical industry, which seems to be more motivated by profits than solutions. I encourage that these other approaches be specified. The effectiveness of public health communications necessitates clear, plain-English language.</li>
<li>There also seems to be a bias toward the time-consuming approach of clinical trials. The plan clearly recognizes the need to the pharmaceutical bias, I think.</li>
<li>The plan rightly includes "related dementias" in defining Alzheimer's Disease. But it identifies only Lewy body, frontotemporal, and vascular dementias as examples. Unless recognized but not stated by the drafters, I suggest including other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS/Lew Gehrig, and MS. Such an expansion might introduce synergies and efficiencies and potentially a considerably more significant effect.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>Admittedly, my own personal research into AD is limited. I have only recently begun to dig more deeply into the subject. Much of my motivation comes from frustration over the silence and apparent helplessness of the traditional medical community toward my wife's disease. I have recently read two books that have strongly influenced me: "Alzheimer's Disease---What If There Was a Cure"---The Story of Ketones" by Dr. Mary Newport, and "Stop Alzheimer's Now! How to Prevent and Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders" by Dr. Bruce Fife.These books introduced me to the "Type 3 Diabetes" aspect of AD, which I find most intriguing and compelling. If what they say is true about insulin-deficiency and insulin-resistance in the brain and the resultant "starvation" of neurons, and that nutritional substitutes in the form of ketone bodies from medium-chain triglyceride fatty acids already exist on the shelves of health food stores in the forms of coconut oil and MCT oils, THIS IS HUGE. Considering that I might be "starving" my wife's neurons by not providing this source of fuels (already used by neonatologists, according to Dr. Newport and in pediatrics, according to my RN daughter), ignoring this evidence is morally unconscionable to me. Also if true, this nutritional approach could be a "silver bullet" of vast consequence.</p>
<p>Thank you for soliciting comments from the public in reaction to the draft plan. I apologize for missing the March 30 deadline. Such tardiness has become commonplace for me as an Alzheimer's caregiver and health advocate. And thank you for your contribution to this important work.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>Unless you have cared for a family member throughout their demise due to Alzheimer's, you cannot possibly imagine the horror and sadness this disease inflicts upon a family. It took eleven years for our beloved mother to finally succumb to this wretched disease. It completely destroyed our father, as the primary caregiver, depleted ALL of our parents' savings, and left our family penniless and in a shambles. Our dear father's health was so comprised as her caregiver, that he is now in a nursing home, dying. I cannot stop crying. We have not only lost both parents, but also all hope of any chance of happiness for their children and grandchildren. I hope you do not have to experience this first hand before you understand how devastating Alzheimer's truly is. Turning your back on an opportunity to stop this dreadful disease will surely prove to be a failure to act to save someone in your OWN family from this tragedy. Alzheimer's is no respecter of persons. Please help.</p>

<p>Having been associated with the Alzheimer Society of Washington for thirty years I have seen many changes in the recognition, support and care for person affected by dementia. The scope of the Draft National Plan makes it clear that leaders in the nation have recognized the need to bring together governmental and private agencies to develop a plan. I applaud the work that has been done and have only a few comments:</p>
<ol><li>Even though the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD) increases with age <strong><em>it is not an "aging" issue</em></strong>. AD is a chronic disease and designating many of the programs that serve people affected by dementia to, or through, the National Institutes on Aging or through Older Americans Act programs shifts a chronic health problem to an aging issue. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) could be assigned to oversee all Chronic Disease and Disability programs -- then AD supportive services could fall under the auspices of NIH. This action would make AD more likely to be seen as a chronic disease and should elicit preventive health-related responses, even though there is not currently a cure for AD.</li>
<li>While this report addresses reducing stigma and bringing better understanding to the needs of people with dementia, it still reflects the medical bias that can occur in so much of health care. In the <em>Draft National Plan, Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce it says, "The training will be released in Spring 2012, and will be available to all <strong>nursing homes to share with their staff</strong></em>." I recommend the language be changed to say,"...will be available to all "<strong><em>organizations providing dementia care</em></strong>." My reason for expanding the beneficiaries of the training is that many organizations in the community provide care to people with dementia. Offering training to all organizations that provide supportive services, daycare and home care, and less medically-oriented care, and not limiting the training to nursing homes, can help the person with dementia remain in the community longer -- and reduce healthcare costs.</li>
<li>Funds designated for <strong><em>research</em></strong> should specifically include <strong><em>Social Innovations</em></strong>. As I indicated in the paragraph above, there are many organizations that are providing support to people affected by dementia.</li>
</ol><p>Our organization has sponsored two such innovative social programs:</p>
<ol><li>The Early Memory Loss (EML) program, conducted at least yearly, is for the person with dementia and his/her care partner(s). The initial program lasts ten weeks. Participants gather, then are divided. People with dementia are in one group; the family care partners are in another. The same topic is addressed in each group, but in a way that is appropriate for the person with dementia or the family members. Upon completion of the weekly EML program the group "graduates" into a follow-up support group that is made up of attendees from previous classes and meets monthly.</li>
<li>The second program is called "Staying Connected" and is for people with early memory loss. Participants attend a small (up to 8 people) 3-hour weekly group that provides physical, social and mental stimulation. Over the past three years many of the participants have retained their mental capacity and have continued to benefit from the program. Their care partners have benefitted, too, by having this supportive community program.</li>
</ol><p>Research into <strong><em>Social Innovations</em></strong> could help provide credibility and more support for these kinds of programs.</p>

<p>The National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities (NASUAD) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, as published on February 22, 2012.</p>
<p>NASUAD represents the nation's 56 state and territorial agencies on aging and disabilities. As part of the National Aging Network, each of our members oversees the implementation of the Older Americans Act (OAA), through funds awarded by the Administration on Aging (AoA). Additionally, many member-states also serve as the operating agency for Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) waivers that serve older adults, and in some cases, individuals with disabilities. The Association's principal mission is to design, improve, and sustain state systems delivering home and community based services and supports for people who are older or have a disability, and their caregivers.</p>
<p>The enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) has created a long-overdue opportunity to focus the nation's attention on Alzheimer's disease, and the Association applauds the Administration's recognition of both the vital need to address the many challenges facing people with the disease, their families, and caregivers; and the urgency with which this must be done. Additionally, we find the draft plan's guiding principles, which seek to optimize existing resources and improve and coordinate ongoing activities, to support public-private partnerships, and to transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease, to be an appropriate reflection of the ambitious, yet attainable, goals embodied by the plan itself.</p>
<p>Guided by a vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease, the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease outlines goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network. Consequently, NASAUD respectfully submits for your consideration the following comments and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces.</strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds the Department's efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through AoA. While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies. </strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds states for recognizing the need to develop comprehensive plans to address Alzheimer's disease, but we are concerned that these plans are being conceptualized and developed without involvement from the Aging Network. State agencies on aging and disabilities play a critical role in the oversight and delivery of services that are designed to support older adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease, in their homes and communities. For these reasons, NASUAD recommends that state agencies on aging and disabilities, and other relevant stakeholders, should be involved at all stages of Alzheimer's state plan development.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with the Older Americans Act, state agencies must develop a State Plan on Aging, which is envisioned by AoA as a comprehensive plan document that articulates the direction in which state long-term care efforts are moving, key strategies to address the strong desires of the rapidly growing new generation of long-term care consumers to be served in their homes and communities, and how the state will address the challenges of America's budgetary constraints and competing priorities in today's society. Given these existing requirements, State Plans on Aging may be the most appropriate place for states to describe their short and long-term strategies for addressing Alzheimer's disease. The integration of Alzheimer's state plans into State Plans on Aging would align with the need for a holistic approach to combatting the disease itself, as well as AoA's intent that State Plans serve as valuable tools for planning and tracking all of the state's efforts on behalf of older adults.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services. </strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the Department's approach of expanding linkages between existing disease support and community information centers supported by AoA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In order to successfully connect members of the public with the necessary services and supports, NASUAD recommends that HHS also examine the capacity of these existing structures, particularly those within the Aging Network, such as ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, and SHIPs, to ensure that these resources are adequately funded to meet the needs of this growing population.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that any strategy to strengthen the Aging Network's capacity to provide families and people with AD access to appropriate services and specialized long-term care planning should be implemented in such a manner that does not overly burden these existing systems. Rather, any approach should provide the Aging Network with the necessary resources to meet these unique needs and to develop innovative practices for doing so. In addition, HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies, as well as patient advocacy organizations, and make these tools readily available within the next year for distribution through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD supports the Department's recognition of the potential for the ADRC Evidence Based Care Transitions program to implement evidence-based care transition models that meaningfully engage older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their informal caregivers. Throughout this evaluation process, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider the impact that additional resources could have on the ability of ADRCs to build their capacity and successfully support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.3: Develop an AD-specific toolkit on care transitions. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this toolkit be developed in consultation with state agencies on aging and disabilities, and be available for distribution throughout the Aging Network within the year.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H.2: Identify steps to ensure access to long-term services and supports for younger people with AD.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the proposed collaboration between the Administration on Aging (AoA), the Office on Disability, and Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) to address access to long-term services and supports across the lifespan, and believes these agencies should be consulted as stakeholders throughout the plan's development and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports HHS efforts to give caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner, and recommends that plans to do so include input from the Aging Network. To facilitate the identification and distribution of culturally-appropriate materials to caregivers, NASUAD recommends that within the year, HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally-sensitive materials and trainings that are currently available, and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS utilize its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials and make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS distribute the identified best practices in a manner that recognizes the variance in long-term services and supports systems across, and within, states. Since what may be a promising practice in one state may be ineffective in another, NASUAD encourages HHS to recognize the importance of state flexibility in meeting the unique needs of individuals within each state.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, so it is important that the evaluation of such programs not be limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.4: Develop and disseminate evidence-based interventions for people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement the strategies defined in Action 3.B.3, NASUAD recommends that HHS quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's disease, and their families, have access to successful evidence based intervention programs. There are existing programs that NASUAD recommends HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Older Americans Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging. Funding should also be increased for the programs funded by the Act.</li>
<li><strong>Lifespan Respite Care Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services. Additional funds should be allocated to the Act.</li>
<li><strong>National Family Caregivers Support Program</strong> -- At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems.</strong><br />
					As HHS works to connect caregivers with appropriate supportive services, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the existing capacity of ADRCs to serve as "No Wrong Doors" through which individuals, their families, and caregivers can access available services and programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recognizes and applauds the successes of the VA in providing home and community based care, and realizes the importance of sharing lessons learned from the implementation of these programs across agency and state lines. NASUAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible, so that important information is gathered and shared not only among federal programs, but also throughout the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs. </strong><br />
					Once HHS completes this barrier-identification process, NASUAD recommends that HHS work with federal stakeholders, including CMS and AoA, as well as state and local agencies on aging, to develop and implement solutions to the identified obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts.</strong><br />
					In looking to expand public outreach and awareness about Alzheimer's disease and the importance of long-term care planning, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the successes of the Aging Network in providing outreach and education, such those achieved by ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, SHIPs, and state and local agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement this strategy, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider implementing the Elder Justice Act (EJA), as established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The EJA fully realizes the need to protect our most vulnerable citizens from financial exploitation, as well as from physical and emotional abuse and neglect, and it creates structures and programs for doing so. Though the EJA was signed into law in 2010, it has yet to receive any federal dollars. Without a strong financial commitment to address the growing problem of abuse and neglect among older adults, it will be impossible to fully secure the dignity, safety, and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease. NASUAD recommends that HHS work with Congress to fully fund the Elder Justice Act.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD recommends that these efforts take into consideration the existing framework and resources for legal services that are available through the OAA. Additionally, training should be offered to legal professionals throughout the Aging Network, and the curriculum should address the importance of cultural competence. Training should also be extended to state Adult Protective Services workers as well as to other individuals as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes.</strong><br />
					To leverage existing successful systems, NASUAD recommends that federal and state representatives from AoA's National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program be involved in this collaborative effort.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping older adults and individuals with disabilities, including those with Alzheimer's and other dementias, remain in the community rather than in institutional settings. With a focus on programs and strategies undertaken by AoA, state agencies on aging and disabilities, and area agencies on aging, NASUAD recommends that HUD and HHS work with the Aging Network to identify innovative practices, barriers to success, and solutions to these barriers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em>. </strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community based care systems to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation<em>: Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em>.</strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of necessary health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias, their families, and their caregivers. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families, and caregivers in primary care, institutional, and home and community based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS use existing "No Wrong Door" systems, such as ADRCs, to link individuals to accurate information, resources, services, and supports, in a manner that recognizes the potential need to enhance the capacity of ADRCs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.B.1: Convene leaders from state and local governments.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS include state directors on aging and disabilities in this collaboration, as well as state long-term care directors.</p>
<p>On behalf of NASUAD, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. We look forward to continuing to work with HHS to develop a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that seeks to achieve the vision of a nation free of the disease, while maintaining the dignity and independence of those with Alzheimer's disease, their families and their caregivers. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or Lindsey Copeland, NASUAD's Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs to further discuss any of these issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on NAPA from an Alzheimer's expert with 30 years of dementia experience</strong></p>
<p>NAPA's outline is a <strong>comprehensive masterpiece</strong> which I am grateful for the opportunity to offer comments...I've waited decades for this!</p>
<p>I want to thank President Obama, for keeping the promise he made in response to my Town Hall question in Scranton PA during his initial campaign. My question to him was: "What do you plan to do about the Alzheimer's epidemic?"</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong><br />
					Only 1% of physicians specialize in geriatrics; even fewer are experts in Alzheimer's and dementia. Less than 5% of nurse practitioners are certified as gerontological nurse practitioners. Similar statistics exist for psychiatrists who specialize in geriatrics or dementia care. We are about 13,000 geriatric physicians short now: the American Geriatrics Society estimated it will get worse: a 36,000 deficit of geriatric physicians by 2030. Is there hope?</p>
<p>The lack of Medicare reimbursement for comprehensive geriatric assessment, dementia assessments, family caregiver support, counseling and education have deterred young medical students from entering geriatrics. Geriatricians' salaries are considerably than physicians in sub-specialties. If the annual threat to cut Medicare continues, elders and Baby Boomers will suffer even further access to elder care specialists. If NAPA has any influence in this area, it is essential to have Alzheimer's experts for the dementia bubble ready to burst!</p>
<p>I, as a Gerontological Nurse Practitioner, taught family medicine residents Alzheimers and dementia care in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and on house calls between 1987-1999. Most medical students during the nineties were graduating with less than 10 hours of lectures specific to geriatrics: with no little or curriculum on Alzheimer's, dementia or geriatric pharmacology. Geriatric rotations were not common in many primary care residencies at that time. Even today, primary care provider attendance is lacking at continuing education programs on Alzheimer's disease. I suggest that NAPA offers funding for Alzheimer's CE programs to be offered by geriatric educators. I recommend at least four hours of annual mandatory CE for practicing physicians and other primary care providers on the following topics:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Geriatric Prescribing</strong>: This should include emphasis on the <em>Beers List of potentially inappropriate medications in elders</em>. Adverse drug events affect elders more than any other age group. Persons with Alzheimer's disease are at even greater risk for delirium due to their low levels of brain acetylcholine. There are over 6 million elders on one or more potentially inappropriate medications for elders. Adverse drug reactions in seniors are a leading cause of ER visits and hospitalizations; hence further driving up US health care costs. <em>Many providers remain uneducated re the Beers list</em>. This has been confirmed by many nurses who participated in my 600+ seminars in over 40 states).</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease (Late Onset and Early Onset) Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's Dementia, and Frontotemporal Dementia</strong>: Primary health care providers need to be comfortable diagnosing and differentiating the major types of dementia, performing a dementia workup and treating Alzheimer's Disease/dementias using clinical guidelines. There are simply not enough dementia specialists for PCP's to refer to. The waiting times for families to see a dementia expert are much too long!</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia</strong>: All prescribers treating elders need to fully understand the risks of antipsychotic therapy, paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines in frail elders, and the non-pharmacological approaches to dementia behaviors. Providers should become familiar with the evidence-based research on these topics. This will enable them to help patients and their families learn the benefits of antidementia medications and the risks of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in elders.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce </strong><br />
					With a rate of 50% turnover of nursing assistants and direct care staff in states like my own (PA), we need to make LTC a setting where staff remain, ensuring continuity for resident care. Direct care workers are at risk of physical injury and disability. Administrators face rising workman's compensation costs when behaviors of dementia re not optimally treated. Staffing issues, poor retention, burnout and lack of dementia education contribute.</p>
<p>I request that national dementia experts who are entrepreneurs have opportunities to partner in business with governments and state agencies in educating the direct care workforce. I feel that at least 50% of training should be live; to allow staff to ask questions relevant to the patients they serve. Video and online learning can be a supplement, but should we not give the best to the staff that spend the most time with Alzheimer's residents? The #1 reason they resign is because they don't feel that they are respected. Honoring their efforts with live dementia education is an excellent strategy that will save money that is being spent on training a transitory workforce.</p>
<p>Many of us have been working in the community trenches of Alzheimer's care, outside of academic or research settings for decades and want to share our wealth of knowledge and experience. I've been educating nursing assistants, nurses and interdisciplinary staff for 12 years! The National Council for Certified Dementia Practitioners offers a full-day live curriculum that could lead national certification as a CDP: Certified Dementia Practitioner.</p>
<p>Dementia education should not be limited to nursing assistants. It should be available and funded for LPNs (who run most LTC units). Dementia research changes daily to weekly, so updates need to be shared with RN's, administrators, social workers, pharmacists, physical, occupational, recreational and speech therapists, social workers, and dieticians. Only through interdisciplinary education will senior communities be on the "same page" for best practices in long-term care, assisted living, CCRC's and home and hospice care.</p>
<p>I request that dementia education businesses that have clinical experience in dementia care be included in the force to strengthen the direct care workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br /><em>HHS will coordinate with states to develop aging workforces that are AD-capable and culturally competent.<br />
					AoA will ask states to specify strategies to improve the AD-capability of the workforce. </em><br />
					I would request that state agencies will have grants and opportunities to partner with for-profits dementia education corporations, especially those that are reaching families currently though the power of social networking.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong><br />
					I have been diagnosing Alzheimer's and dementia for 30 years. I still see nursing home residents, home care patients or nursing home residents who are not yet diagnosed until the moderate or late stage of Alzheimer's disease. I've met families in which loved ones were killed in auto accidents due to a driver with undiagnosed dementia, spouses who have been bankrupted by their husband's undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease. Part of the problem is family denial, apathy, fear, and helplessness. The remaining problem is that some health care providers lack knowledge of the dementia workup and evidence-based clinical guidelines for treatment. Continuing education is essential for providers: families need to be educated of the warning signs and know where to go for help.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting people with Alzheimer's disease and their families and educating the public and providers. </strong><br />
					This is HUGE. Families are starved for direction, information, support and resources. I have provided approximately 200 caregiver workshops in 40 states across the country. The lack of information on Alzheimer's disease causes family turmoil and division. I've seen cases of anger and elder abuse between family members who misinterpreted the personality changes of Alzheimer's as intentional behaviors. Many families have shared with me their frustrations with dementia care in the current health care setting. Seminars should be funded in the community, in senior centers, or in faith communities; where access is easy for stressed families and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong><br />
					Translating research on dementias to professionals and the public has been the main focus of my dementia and geriatric education businesses for the past 12 years. I would request that HHS, VA, federal agencies, ADEAR will also partner with for-profit businesses who have been sharing Alzheimer's information in their businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports<br />
					Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</strong><br />
					Interdisciplinary collaboration needs to be initiated at the undergraduate level in the health sciences, including pre-med. I have taught graduate level geriatrics for 25 years. Evidence-based studies on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, functional state in elders consistently show that the interdisciplinary team approach offers better outcomes than standard medical care. Teams consistently outperform the hierarchical model of care. This should not be surprising, as Alzheimer's care and general geriatric care is functional, medical, psychological, pharmacological, social, spiritual, legal and financial. Alzheimer's care needs to be shared jointly, not "directed" by a single profession. Re the medical home concept, I would request that nurse practitioner with Alzheimer's or gerontological experience, be included as leaders in the Alzheimer's medical home model.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system</strong><br />
					I would request that Medicare reimbursement codes be established for comprehensive caregiver assessments and that providers can choose the caregiver assessment instrument that works best for them; rather than be directed by a 3rd party. Suggested instruments are the The Zarit Burden Interview or the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (CSI). Reimbursement should be allowed for both initial diagnosis and counseling as well as ongoing caregiver assessment and support.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					I feel that for-profit Alzheimer's/dementia education corporations, non-profit dementia educators; Alzheimer's Association chapters should have the ability and financial incentives to educate attorneys. My opinion is that only attorneys who are CELAs (Certified Elder Law Attorneys) should be able to title themselves as elder care experts. There is a national examination and certification for other attorneys who are committed to the senior population who desire this certification.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong><br />
					I have prescribed medications in LTC units over three decades. Over the past 20 years, OBRA had some impact on dementia antipsychotic use in nursing homes, but not as much as was hoped for. Despite a nearly doubled risk of mortality (1.7x) due to stroke, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, antipsychotics are still routinely prescribed for behaviors related to dementia. Many prescribers are not aware that antipsychotic effectiveness for dementia was less than 20% effective in the CATIE study. Several studies revealed that staff dementia education was more effective than antipsychotic treatment for dementia behaviors. Funding should be available to educate prescribers regarding risks of antipsychotics for dementia. 88% of reimbursement claims submitted to Medicare for antipsychotic drugs prescribed for nursing home residents during a six-month review period (January to June 2007) were for residents diagnosed with dementia! So I applaud the recent work of Dan Levinson and the Office of Inspector General to reduce antipsychotic use for behaviors in dementia.</p>
<p>Please contact me if my 30 years in the "dementia trenches" will be of assistance to your remarkable action plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Arts and Aging Research</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As a pioneer in Art and Aging programming and recipient of the 2012 MetLife Foundation Creativity and Aging in America Leadership award in the category of Community, the Alzheimer's Poetry Project welcomes the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan is well formulated and seeks to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a role for arts and aging research.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize those living with the disease today and tomorrow will require the best possible care we can offer. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>Among the areas in NAPA that arts programming could be especially effective include educating family and the public about the disease and under lessening the stigma of the disease. A number of arts groups including the Alzheimer's Poetry Project have this effect when we hold workshops for family members and students. Our public arts events such as "Alzheimer's Poetry Day" held at among other locations, the National Hispanic Cultural Center held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 5th 2011 in English and Spanish is one such example.</p>
<p>A few arts programs serving people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and their families, that have extensive experience in helping to educate caregivers and in demonstrating the role that creativity can play in the health of people navigating memory loss, that have show promise in research studies include:</p>
<ul><li>"Meet Me at MoMA," The Museum of Modern Arts dementia program.</li>
<li>"Time Slips," a Storytelling project with people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</li>
<li>SONGWRITING WORKS., which engages elders, older adults and families in hands- on songwriting and performance using an internationally recognized method proven to restore health and community.</li>
<li>"The Dancing Heart," Kairos Dance, which vitally engages those with mid-to-late stage Alzheimer's, in a weekly dance and storytelling playshop that has shown to positively improve the health of participants.</li>
</ul><p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating the white paper "The Arts and Human Development: Learning across the Lifespan," which frames a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being. We recommend that the NEA have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating NAPA.</p>
<p>In the NEA, "Creativity and Aging Study The Impact of Professionally Conducted Cultural Programs on Older Adults," 2006 they write, "...In conclusion, these results point to powerful positive intervention effects of these community-based art programs run by professional artists. They point to true health promotion and disease prevention effects."</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to bring to your attention to two among many studies that show the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in improving the health and quality of life for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia including: "Singing while caring for persons with dementia<sup>1</sup>," and "Using poetry to improve the quality of life and care for people with dementia.<sup>2</sup>"</p>
<p>We must ask our selves what immediate help can we provide to people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and how can we help them to continue to actively participate in the life of a community. Arts based dementia programming offers a chance to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia and their caregivers today. Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p><strong>Entry Citation: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lombardo, Nancy B. Emerson. "Alzheimer's Disease." <em>Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health</em>. Ed. James M. Rippe, MD. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2012. 120-42. <em>SAGE Reference Online</em>. Web. 29 Feb. 2012. 6000 words on-line accessed 2 29 2012 </strong></p>
<p>This entry (a) describes the evolving definition of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease (AD) and its prevalence; (b) summarizes evidence for nutrition, physical exercise, and other healthy lifestyle interventions that may delay onset, prevent occurrence, or slow the progression of AD and other dementias and maintain the emotional and physical health of both the person with dementia and his or her care partners; (c) identifies key lifestyle strategies for preserving brain health--both cognitive and emotional--and how they may be related to body health strategies; and (d) highlights some clinical trial results and introduces a groundbreaking multi-domain study under way in Finland and the body of evidence leading to this seminal trial.</p>
<p>Readers may take away confirmation of the importance of some of the things they are already doing and gain ideas and motivation to adopt brain-healthy nutrition and lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle </strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X">http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X</a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid. (Bayer-Carter JL et al. 2011).</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, I am respectively submitting comments on the Draft National Plan (Plan) to Address Alzheimer's Disease. In general, I believe the Plan is well timed, comprehensive, and ambitious and our Department supports the Plan. Accomplishing the Plan goals will require collaboration with many different service systems, and the Department of Health &amp; Human Services will likely face challenges in coordinating efforts across these systems.</p>
<p>While achieving the vision of eliminating Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by 2025 is the ultimate goal, the immediate need is appropriate care for those with AD and relief for caregivers. Further, research needs to be expanded into areas that are supportive to caregiving. The Plan should also address the issues and propose solutions of excess deficits that cause unneeded anguish to both the person with dementia and their formal and information caregivers.</p>
<p>Because of the scope and complexity of needs of those with dementia, I believe it is helpful to prioritize those areas of need. First and foremost, there is a wealth of knowledge that enables clinicians to diagnose and treat persons with memory disorders. However, the greatest need is gavubg adequately trained physicians to diagnose and provide care for dementia residents. This issue isn't new; it has been known for the past 10 years. With only 7,162 trained geriatricians in the country or one geriatrician for every 2,620 residents over 75 years of age, there isn't an adequate supply of geriatricians to provide geriatric educational needs among the US medical schools.</p>
<p>There is discussion in the draft plan about the need to expand and prioritize research aimed at developing new pharmacological interventions for preventing and treating Alzheimer's Disease. There is also some mention about reducing the use of antipsychotic medications for treating the symptoms of AD in institutional settings. Both of these action items are laudable. What is missing is a recommendation to reduce the current widespread, wasteful and in some cases harmful, overuse and misuse of the cholinesterase inhibitors and related combination therapies in treating AD. Practice guidelines for cost effective and efficacious pharmacological interventions in the treatment of AD are available but not widely adhered to.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there discussions are currently being held about the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. Numbers of people are not now being identified; therefore a module asking respondents if someone in their home has dementia and the follow-ups would greatly help us identify the numbers outside of proper care, care-home settings, etc., that currently suffer dementias.</p>
<p>For your consideration, together with the above general recommendations, I respectively offer more specific comments. For example, although the Plan makes mention of emergency rooms, there needs to be "best practice" models that are shared with the thousands of hospital emergency rooms in the US. In addition, I propose these suggestions on specific goals, strategies, and actions:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E</strong>: This priority deals with translating findings into medical practice and public health programs. There should be a separate action item that addresses the shortcomings in the current pharmacological treatment of AD and guidance to prescribers on how to remedy this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1</strong>: This priority is not just important, it is essential if we expect to slow progress, delay onset and prevent AD. It needs to be a collaborative effort that is international in scope (Strategy 1.D) with high level commitment and energy that includes public and private resources and their networks interconnected. Money for research alone will not achieve what is needed. We need to look at past models of disease threats like tuberculosis, polio and HIV that had a grass roots demand for a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3</strong>: This is also essential; we need some fast "wins" through medical research that energize the world-wide community committed to eliminating dementia illnesses. And, in addition to expanding the enrollment of all racial and ethnic populations, we need to have several drug investigations on an urgent fast-track that not only give people hope but the belief that we are doing everything possible to get these issues under control.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3</strong>: ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral) needs to be a more widespread publically funded resource; there needs to be, for example, posters advertising it in post offices, libraries, and other public spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: The lack of adequately trained providers is addressed by dedicating "6 million dollars over two years for provider education and outreach." This is a limited amount of money to fix the national issue of solving the access to care issue with competent geriatricians. Further, there needs to be expanded roles for Advance Practice Registered Nurses in geriatric care.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A</strong>: This strategy has a direct connection to PDA programs. PDA has done some work through the Long-Term Living Training Institute and Direct-Care Worker initiatives around educating and strengthening the direct care workforce to ensure workers are dementia-capable. PDA would welcome additional support in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.4</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to train more direct workers in nursing homes and professionals that provide services in home and community based settings. PDA has provided funding to the Delaware Valley Alzheimer's Association to provide dementia specific training to those professionals that provide in-home care. The training is designed to improve care techniques that can be directly applied to day-to-day care in the home which can reduce the stress and burden on both professionals and family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 2.C and 3.B</strong>: Contained in Pennsylvania's assessment for services for older adults is a 24-question assessment of caregiver status and needs. PDA would be interested to learn what other states are using and their best practices in terms of caregiver assessment instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to improve care for certain populations, specifically those with intellectual disabilities. PDA currently co-chairs the Joint Committee on Aging &amp; Intellectual Disabilities (ID) with the Office of Developmental Programs. The committee was formed to improve services and supports available to older persons with ID by working together through interagency coordination and collaboration. As the number of people aging with ID continues to grow, education for both professionals and caregivers along with proper supports should be a focus and be given special consideration to ensure the proper care for this population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees a great need for increased housing options for individuals with AD. Affordable, safe housing is a special problem during the early to middle stages of the disease for individuals who live alone and do not have informal caregivers to provide support.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 4.A and 4.B</strong>: Public awareness campaigns and pooling/compiling resources should be organized around a single, nationally recognized association/entity related to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, some components of the Plan have a direct connection to PDA programs, such as support of caregivers and enhancing the knowledge of direct care workers. Other components of the Plan such as methods for diagnosis, direct treatment, and research, do not have a direct connection to our programs. However, as I stated above, our Department supports the Plan and, while recognizing that there is no one quick, easy solution to dealing with such wide, complex needs, I feel my comments and suggestions are important for improving the Plan and thereby improving the lives of those with Alzheimer's Disease and their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>I thank you for the opportunity to provide input and look forward to hearing from you regarding my comments.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Congratulations on the development of a thorough and thoughtful draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (National Plan). The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft and looks forward to seeing the final plan implemented. PFCD is a national coalition of patients, providers, community organizations, business and labor groups, and health policy experts committed to raising awareness of the number one cause of death, disability, and rising health care costs in the U.S.: chronic disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (AD) presents a public health crisis in every sense and as such requires an unprecedented collaborative effort to address it effectively. A robust National Plan and the resources needed to implement it are required to assure we achieve, as the National Plan states, a "nation free of Alzheimer's Disease." To help support these efforts, we offer the following comments on the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Research to Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The National Plan includes a solid framework for enhancing research efforts to find ways to prevent and better treat AD. In discussions over research priorities for AD, we encourage consideration of ways to improve care management, care coordination, long-term care, and other aspects of the delivery of care for people with AD in addition to traditional clinical research efforts. For example, programs funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and similar demonstration efforts targeting delivery system reforms should include consideration of patient-centered care models for people with AD and ways to enhance coordination between inpatient and outpatient medical care, community-based services, and long-term care, including managing transitions of care between providers and care settings. The National Plan should specifically recommend inclusion of delivery system research on the national research agenda.</p>
<p>Given the rapid pace of scientific research and knowledge gained, tapping into the expertise from both the public and private sector on a regular, ongoing basis will be critically important to making significant progress by 2025. We applaud the National Plan's call for greater collaboration through Public-Private Partnerships as effective partnerships will play critically important roles in realizing progress in the prevention and treatment of AD, and urge that the final Plan include specific plans to engage public and private stakeholders on an ongoing, regular basis to further develop and implement the plan.</p>
<p>Public-private partnership efforts could prove particularly useful in the development, implementation, and updating of the national research agenda; clinical trial recruitment and development of patient registries; and the development of biomarkers for AD diagnosis and monitoring progression and developing clinical trial endpoints. Public-private partnerships can also enhance regulatory science efforts and informed review processes for potential new treatments by assuring that regulators and other decision-makers are up-to-date on the latest scientific understanding, research challenges, and progress made on AD. These partnerships also offer the opportunity to develop consensus-based best practice recommendations for every setting where people with AD are served to increase quality and efficiency. We recommend that the final National Plan specifically encourage greater public-private collaboration in these critical areas and regularly engage a wide variety of stakeholders including medical, clinical, and public health professionals, patients and family caregivers, community organizations, the biomedical research industry, public and private payors, long-term care providers, and employers.</p>
<p>We also commend the inclusion of efforts to facilitate the translation of research findings into medical practice and public health programs and to educate the public about the latest research findings. We recommend that the National Plan include recommendations that information be presented in ways and through vehicles that are both understandable and actionable to providers, public health professionals, payors, and the public.</p>

<p>We commend the National Plan for recognizing the tremendous burden AD places on family and friend caregivers and the need to do more to support them, including educating healthcare providers on the need to evaluate caregivers for signs that their own health is at risk. Providers' ability to do that effectively, however, depends upon them being able to identify family and friend caregivers. Encouraging providers to document on medical records that a person is a family caregiver for someone with AD or another chronic condition would assist that outreach greatly. Likewise, the ability to facilitate better coordination of care, including care occurring outside medical facilities, would be enhanced if providers noted the name of the primary caregiver(s) on the AD patient's medical record. We recommend that the final National Plan include outreach to providers to incorporate such documentation into the medical records for both family caregivers and the people to whom they provide care.</p>
<p>Early detection and diagnosis of AD will help significantly with care planning and aligning support for the person diagnosed and his or her family. An additional step in early detection should be engaging the person with AD and family caregiver in advance care planning, so that the person with AD can have substantive input while they have the capacity to do so. We encourage the inclusion of this step in your recommendations. The National Plan includes efforts to educate providers, caregivers, and attorneys on AD, disease progression, and the costs associated with care. We suggest that educational efforts also include financial advisors, as the costs of care and long-term nature of the disease necessitate careful financial planning.</p>
<p><strong>Assure Adequate Funding to Realize the Promise of the National Plan </strong></p>
<p>An excellent National Plan is only a set of great ideas without the funding to make them a reality. The Administration's recent announcement of additional funding for AD research and support for people with AD and their families represents a good start, but much more will be needed to implement the National Plan. One near-term opportunity is assuring better coordination of clinical care with community resources at the state and local level. States and communities should be supported to facilitate this coordination to streamline access to essential services for families and increase the efficiency of the systems at the state and local level. Many states are actively engaging public health resources to address the burden of AD. The National Plan should build on these efforts and those at the Centers for Disease Control to fully engage public health resources to evaluate the AD burden and work to address it. This suggestion is in concert with existing policy such as the Strategic Framework on Multiple Chronic Conditions.</p>
<p>When evaluating the need to devote resources to implementing the National Plan, we urge the Administration and congressional appropriators to consider the significant budgetary toll AD exacts. According to the Alzheimer's Association, AD will cost the United States more than $200 Billion in 2012 with the trajectory increasing to more than $307 Billion in just 15 years and almost $1.1 Trillion by 2050. In times of tight budgets, we understand that finding the resources to implement the National Plan will be increasingly difficult, but given the tremendous toll AD takes not only on those afflicted and their families, but also state and federal budgets, these are investments we simply must make.</p>
<p>We applaud your efforts in the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The draft represents a well-considered, comprehensive approach. We appreciate the opportunity to review and comment on the draft Plan, and look forward to starting the hard work of implementing the final Plan to make a significant difference.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, we thank you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your work to forumulate the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Plan, as demonstrated in strategies 2.A and 2.C, which call for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items located under Strategy 2.A are significant, we remain concerned that the essential workforce goals identified by the Council cannot be realized without the investment of additional resources. Specifically, the action items calls for additional and enhanced activities within Geriatric Education Centers (GEC), the Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP), the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program (GACA), the Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral and mental Health Providers (GTPD) program, and the Direct-Care Workforce training program. These programs, which are administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under the Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act, are in constant danger of defunding and have experienced stagnant funding that has not kept up with the pace of inflation, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. To implement these additional and enhanced activities in order to realize the goal of enhancing care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions additional funding must be invested.</p>
<p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the committee continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you.</p>

<p>The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) is the national professional association representing the interests of more than 140,000 occupational therapists, students of occupational therapy, and therapy assistants. The practice of occupational therapy is sciencedriven, evidence-based, and enables people of all ages to live life to its fullest by promoting health and minimizing the functional effects of illness, injury, and disability. Occupational therapy practitioners do important work with individuals who have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families, and AOTA appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as it works to implement the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p><strong>Occupational Therapy and Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>Five goals form the foundation of the Draft National Plan: (1) Prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, (2) Optimize care quality and efficiency, (3) Expand supports for people with AD and their families, (4) enhance public awareness and engagement, and (5) track progress and drive improvement. AOTA sees the profession of occupational therapy as a key partner in each of these five areas. Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants work with individuals who have AD and with their families to maximize occupational engagement, promote safety, and enhance quality of life. A variety of skilled techniques are used when working with an individual who has AD, depending on the focus of the intervention, the stage of the disease process, and the treatment setting.</p>
<p>An occupational therapist's evaluation of a person with AD begins with an occupational profile of the individual's valued occupations, roles and routines, as well as his or her current level of occupational performance. Often the caregiver is crucial in supplying this information as the person with AD may be unable to provide accurate information, or may be unaware of his or her own deficits. It is essential to identify the remaining abilities of the person with AD rather than to focus solely on what he or she can no longer do. Some examples include:</p>
<ul><li>Identifying performance patterns (i.e., habits and routines) that can be maintained which will prolong independence and assist with adjustment to new living settings such as a health care facility or a daughter's home. Practitioners also consider information stored in the patient's procedural memory, which often remains stable for the longest period of time in someone with AD. Performing well-learned basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as combing one's hair, is an example of utilizing procedural memory. Practitioners learn what the client's hobbies and occupations are which will help with planning the intervention to stimulate patient interest and active participation.</li>
<li>Determining what type of cueing strategies the individual best responds to, and instructing staff on how and when to utilize these strategies during various activity demands. (E.g., does the patient require a one-step verbal command or does he or she need tactile cueing in addition to verbal cues? Can the client follow multi-step commands?)</li>
<li>Determining the time of the day that the person is most alert to maximize performance with activities. (E.g., if the client's typical routine pre-illness was working at night and sleeping during the daytime, then changing that routine may be challenging. The optimal time for engagement in activity may be late afternoons.)</li>
</ul><p>Other areas of consideration include accompanying conditions such as visual loss, or hearing loss. Education of the caregiver (e.g., family or facility staff or both) is a priority and expertise of occupational therapy practitioners, and the therapist should include identification of caregiver concerns about occupational performance and handling difficult behaviors as part of the evaluation. <em>See</em> attachments 1 and 2.</p>
<p>For a person in the early stage of AD, occupational therapy intervention may focus more on compensation for the loss of cognitive abilities and recognition of remaining abilities rather than on the remediation of deficit areas. This is helpful since new learning may be impaired or absent as the dementia progresses.</p>
<p>For persons in the later stages of the disease, the intervention focus may become adaptation of the environment and instruction of caregivers to promote continued occupational performance, as well as learning ways to minimize any unwanted behaviors (such as agitation, combativeness during caretaking) or complicating conditions (such as weight loss, or falls). Addressing the safety of the person with AD is paramount.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of occupational therapy intervention for someone with AD is to set up a program to promote independence, participation in the community, utilize retained abilities for as long as possible, ensure safety, and enhance quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>In the absence of a cure, this goal seeks to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities by 2025. Toward this end, HHS proposes to convene an AD research summit with national and international scientists (Action 1.A.1) and convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013 (Action 1.A.4). AOTA asks that you include occupational therapy in these events. HHS also plans to solicit public and private input on AD research priorities (Action 1.A.2) and continue clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions (Action 1.B.6). In these areas, AOTA asks HHS not to neglect research on effective treatment, education, and support for caregivers and to study lifestyle interventions for caregivers</p>
<p>Outreach efforts to more effectively inform the public about research findings and results are also planned, and AOTA reminds the department to take advantage of using professional associations to educate members and providers (Action 1.E.3).</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>HHS recognizes that high-quality care for people with AD requires an adequate supply of qualified, culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills and expertise. AOTA notes that the Draft Plan places the bulk of its emphasis on physician providers, when patients will be seeing many other allied health care professionals in the new health care system. It is the nonphysician practitioners, such as occupational therapists, who provide most of the support for patients with AD and certainly their caregivers. The $6 million dollar investment of the Obama Administration for provider education and outreach should include specialized training for occupational therapy, and other efforts by both the Veteran's Administration (VA) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) should include support not only for physicians and nurses, but other qualified and licensed professionals (Strategy 2.A.2).</p>
<p>As far as dementia-specific work (Action 2.A.3; 2.D.1), occupational therapy has a proven track record in caring for patients with dementia and is working with the American Medical Association (AMA) --convened Physician's Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) to develop and manage quality measures for dementia. <em>See</em> Gitlin, L. N., Winter, L., Dennis, M. P., Hodgson, N., &amp; Hauck, W. W. (2010). A biobehavioral home-based intervention and the well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> 30(9), 983--991; Strzalecki, M. (2010). The dementia care difference. <em>OT Practice</em> 15(12), available: <a href="http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx">http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>In examining improved care transitions through Medicare's Community-Based Care Transitions Program and the Aging and Disabilities Resource Center (ADRC) Evidence-Based Care Transitions Program (Action 2.F.2), AOTA reminds decision-makers that occupational therapy has an established role in discharge planning, home evaluation, safety, and caregiving training that is an asset in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and their Families </strong></p>
<p>This third goal acknowledges the important role that caregivers plan in the life of a person with AD: they provide care and support, help lessen feelings of depression and stress, and help delay nursing home placements. To further support caregivers, HHS plans to partners with private organizations to review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations (Action 3.B.3). Occupational therapy should be part of these private-public partnerships.</p>
<p>HHS has also noted that medications, including anti-psychotic drugs, can be used inappropriately to manage the difficult behaviors of nursing home residents who have AD. Occupational therapy practitioners would like to be part of collaborative efforts to reduce inappropriate and off-label use of behavior modifying drugs and agents. AOTA encourages the use of occupational therapy interventions to address inappropriate behaviors without the use of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In order to further its goal of enhancing public understanding of AD and engagement stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by persons with the disease and their families, HHS plans, in part, to work with state and local governments to improve coordination and identify model initiatives to advance AD awareness and readiness (Strategy 4.B). AOTA applauds plans to involve state and local governmental entities to further the National Plan, but we wish to note the importance of involving professional associations at the state level in these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Track Progress and Drive Improvement </strong></p>
<p>Finally, HHS plans to identify the gaps in existing data and pursue roads to expand and enhance the data infrastructure in this field and to make data more easily accessible to federal agencies and researchers (Strategy 5.A). Occupational therapy practitioners are also cognizant of information gaps related to the study of AD, and will be interested to access and utilize any improvements HHS is able to make, particular in the area of new quality measures, participating in new data collection efforts, or more easily viewing improved data sets or links between data sets.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AOTA looks forward to working with HHS to implement NAPA. AOTA's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease are en route via U.S. mail, and additional materials about occupational therapy contributions to the field are available upon request; please do not hesitate to contact us with questions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) - Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The AGS is a membership organization comprised of over 6,000 geriatrics healthcare professionals who are devoted to improving the health, independence and quality of life of all older people. The Society provides leadership to healthcare professionals, policy makers and the public by advocating for and implementing programs in patient care, research, professional and public education and public policy.</p>
<p>As geriatrics healthcare professionals, we are all too aware of the growing shortage of professionals trained to care for the rapidly growing population of older Americans. We are pleased to see that the report recognizes the importance of building a strong geriatrics workforce. As noted under Goal 2 in the report, workforce training and awareness plays an important role in treating and caring for older Americans affected by Alzheimer's disease. We have long advocated for the importance of the entire healthcare workforce to be prepared to care for complex frail elders with multiple chronic conditions as was called for by the Institute of Medicine in its 2008 report, <em>Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the strategy outlined under 2.A. calls for additional and improved activities under several geriatric workforce education and training programs, including the Geriatrics Education Centers (GECs), the Comprehensive Geriatrics Education Program (CGEP), the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Programs (GACA), and the Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral and Mental Health Providers (GTPD) program. Unfortunately, over the past several years, these programs have been essentially flatfunded at a level that is far below what is needed to meet the needs of an aging population. At a time when our nation is facing a critical shortage of geriatrics healthcare professionals across disciplines, we need increased investment in these critical programs. It is unclear from the National Alzheimer's Action Plan whether there will be an increased investment in these programs and we are concerned that without enhanced funding, we will not be able to meet the workforce goals set forth in the draft National Plan.</p>
<p><strong>We urge you to explicitly identify and prioritize increased funding for geriatrics health professions programs under Titles VII and VIII as a priority under NAPA. At a minimum, we need to increase the number of academic clinicians who are funded under the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program and make this an annual awards program (currently awards are only made every five years). We believe that funding should be increased for all other programs that have as a target increasing the knowledge and expertise of the entire workforce to care for older adults. </strong></p>
<p><strong>From a clinical perspective, we believe that it is important to frame Alzheimer's disease within the context of older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We encourage the Task Force to acknowledge this complexity. The high prevalence of multiple coexisting conditions in individuals with Alzheimer's disease will impact many of NAPA's priority areas</strong>. These include development of new models of care, conducting research relevant to the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and training across the paid and unpaid workforce. Alzheimer's patients should not be assumed to have a single condition in isolation. Below we have outlined some specific recommendations related to health care delivery, research, and training.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS </strong></p>
<p><strong>Care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias should take into account the prevalence of other multiple chronic conditions</strong>.<br />
					The current model, which generally assumes an identifiable onset, a predictable progression, and a taxonomy-driven treatment, is most often a poor fit to what we believe contributes to the management of cognitive decline in older persons. AGS believes that we must promote the recognition of the continuous cognitive changes produced by multiple causes as age increases, while encouraging regular follow-up of cognitive performance in aging during annual prevention visits or physicals. This would provide opportunity for early intervention for preventable loss and counseling regarding ongoing risks related to decline. Furthermore, AGS believes cognitive screening is an appropriate part of the annual prevention and wellness visit that is now provided under Medicare and we continue to support NIA and CMS in their efforts to identify appropriate tools for clinicians to use during the annual prevention visit.</p>
<p><strong>There should be substantial research into health services delivery and better models of care to support older Americans with dementia, their families, and the entire community</strong>.<br />
					This would provide additional benefits to the greater community, in avoiding expensive nursing home and hospital care, which often times, have questionable benefits on quality of life. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are unique in that the entire family unit should be considered the "patient." For example, it may be worth considering models used in other countries where family members are paid to be full-time caregivers with home-based education and resources. The draft plan might also want to consider how to recognize the primary family caregiver as a co-patient. Determining the needs and abilities of the family caregiver are equally important in providing quality care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease or dementia<sup>i</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Federal agencies should work with stakeholders to identify how existing guidelines and measures are being used and also to better align recommendations in these guidelines and standards set forth in quality measures</strong>.<br />
					AGS believes that before we develop more guidelines addressing diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we need a better understanding of what guidelines currently exist and how these are being used. AGS member leaders recently co-lead an effort to develop quality measures related to the clinical management of Dementia and there is currently an effort to get these into practice. One role that HHS should take is that of a convener of organizations with existing guidelines in order to synthesize the evidence base that supports such guidelines and better align the recommendations. We believe that such an effort should be multi-specialty and multi-disciplinary. This effort would also serve to identify gaps in standards and set forth a multi-stakeholder plan to address these. We believe that this can best be accomplished by federal entities such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>The National Plan does not mention the importance of addressing conflicts of interest when developing guidelines and quality standards, and we recommend some level of acknowledgement of the ethical issues. Our suggestion is to include a reference to the 2011 Institute of Medicine's (IOM) <em>Clinical Practice Guidelines We can Trust</em><sup>ii</sup> report, which provides important criteria for evaluating guidelines, as well as quality standards based on such guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Screening for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias</strong><br />
					AGS believes that we need to come to consensus on the public health issue of screening for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. We believe that there is a role for HHS in leading a discussion whether to screen, when to screen, and with what tools. We believe that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) should play an important role in this conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing the Workforce Needed to Care for Older Adults</strong><br />
					The current and increasing shortfall of specially trained geriatrics health professionals has important implications for the care of older adults with Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Title VII and VIII geriatrics workforce programs are critical to training geriatrics faculty and other healthcare providers to better care for older adults. Specifically, the Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACA) program supports not only career development for newly trained geriatric physicians in academic medicine, but also junior geriatrics and gerontology faculty in other health professions such as nursing, pharmacy, and social work. Currently, in all disciplines, there is an insufficient number of geriatrics faculty to train upcoming generations and conduct aging research.</p>
<p>In addition, the Geriatric Education Centers provide quality interdisciplinary geriatric education and training to the health professions workforce including geriatrics specialists and non-specialists. Another important program, the Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral and Mental Health Professions supports training additional faculty in these disciplines so that they have the expertise, skills, and knowledge to teach geriatrics and gerontology to the next generation of health professionals in their disciplines. The Comprehensive Geriatric Education Nursing program supports additional training for nurses who care for older Americans and also provides continuing education. Finally, a new program authorized under ACA, the Geriatric Career Incentive Awards Program, offers grants to foster greater interest among a variety of health professionals in entering the field of geriatrics, long-term care, and chronic care management.</p>
<p>The lack of funding for these programs will substantially reduce the amount of training that American healthcare professional students and providers will receive in caring for older Americans. Again, we urge you to prioritize funding for these important programs, especially the GACA awards, as now is the time to ensure that we develop adequate numbers of faculty to provide this training.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the AGS is supportive of NAPA's proposals to improve quality of care for older Americans with Alzheimer's, and ultimately to overcome the disease. The label of Alzheimer's disease can result in premature limitation of an individual's involvement in his/her own care planning, and thus, we aim to encourage emphasis not only on measuring decline, but also in promoting strengths throughout the course of illness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Mental Health America Comments on Draft National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As an organization concerned with all aspects of mental health, we are very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>We believe, however, that the plan, as currently drafted, falls short of its goals because of three major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding; (2) inadequate attention to research about psychosocial interventions; and 3) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding: </strong></p>
<p>The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to address Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future. It does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83 percent) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. At less than $2 per person, that is not adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Research About Psychosocial Interventions: </strong></p>
<p>As currently drafted, the plan is heavily tilted towards research into finding a cure for Alzheimer's. It focuses much of its attention on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. We recognize that the slowing of the progression of dementia is important.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the research must pay much greater attention to psychosocial interventions, which can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers. Further research in the area can help produce evidence-based practices that will more immediately benefit patients and caregivers. We strongly recommend that the research plan devote greater attention to research about psycho-social interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Attention to Behavioral Health: </strong></p>
<p>Although the plan notes that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders and that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes," not enough attention is paid to these behavioral needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. When this occurs, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. The plan needs to address evidence-based family support interventions that can provide critical support.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<p>On behalf of the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), please find our letter (attached) commenting on the "National Plan" to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>On behalf of the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), I am writing to urge the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the "National Plan" to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NDSS is a nonprofit organization representing the more than 400,000 Americans with Down syndrome and over 350 affiliates worldwide. The mission of NDSS is to be the national advocate for the value, acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome.</p>
<p>NDSS would like to stress the important scientific relationship between Ds and ADRD. Research indicates that virtually all individuals with Down syndrome exhibit the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease by age 40, and 25-75% or more of individuals with Down syndrome over age 40 show the signs and symptoms of ADRD and the percentage increases with age. The incidence of ADRD in people with Down syndrome is estimated to be three to five times greater than that of the general population, which according to the Alzheimer's Association is now estimated to be 5.4 million people, 1 in 8 individuals, living with Alzheimer's. In the past several years, important progress has been made by scientists focused on understanding the connection between Ds and ADRD, yet much more research is needed. For many years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested in programs and studies. Some examples include: a 30-year study on aging and dementia in adults with Ds, a current grant focused on aging of the frontal structures of the brain (including dementia), developing imaging techniques to predict cognitive decline in adults with Ds, and a natural history study on the amyloid deposits in adults with Ds.</p>
<p>A more integral and specific inclusion of Ds in the overall ADRD research efforts, both fundamental and translational, would significantly contribute to progress more broadly and rapidly. <strong>To that end, we would respectfully request that a representative from the Ds research community be added to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services and that the National Plan be amended to incorporate Ds in the research section of the National Plan but also in sections related to public awareness, education and care giver support</strong>.</p>
<p>Individuals with Ds and their families deserve to have the need for research and population specific clinical trials identified specifically and clearly as necessary actions in the final ADRD National Plan as well as the care challenges they face that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on this important National Plan. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any further questions.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Page 10: Action 1.B 6: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions- insert:</p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will continue to conduct evidence based clinical trials to test the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and risk factor reduction in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network serves as the foundation on which the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) is being built to serve as a primary source of information and assistance to persons in need of long term care supports and services. </strong></p>
<p>Action 2.A. 1: Educate Health Care Providers: insert:</p>
<p>"Health care providers will learn how to manage the disease in the context of other health care conditions, and about the role of the ADRC in linking people to support services in the community".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In general, persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers prefer to receive community-based long term services and supports as compared to nursing home placements</strong>. Community-based AD care should be routinely referred to in the plan.</p>
<p>Page 15: Action 2. A. 4: Strengthening the direct-care workforce -insert:</p>
<p>"HHS will strengthen the nursing home, aging services and long-term services and supports direct-care workforce through new training focused on high-quality, person-centered care for people with Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert:</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<p>From a global perspective, the NAPA law, Council and subsequent plan development have given a shot in the arm to the Alzheimer's community which has been pursuing many of the same aims of the act in countries on all five continents. Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI) would like to offer some brief comments to the NAPA planners about the broader context of your work. Though there are major differences in resources and the cost of care between developed and less developed nations, the similarities of challenges around diagnosis, family support, health system development and quality care are universal, as are the aspirations for improved treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's a disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>We offer our comments based primarily in response to draft strategies 1D and 1E, which recommend more international collaboration in the research and public health education sectors, a concept we heartily endorse.</p>
<p>ADI is the international federation of Alzheimer associations around the world, in official relations with the World Health Organization. Each member is the Alzheimer association in their country who support people with dementia and their families. ADI's vision is an improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's as a Global Public Health Issue </strong></p>
<p>The global health community is waking up to the size and scope of the problem of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. These comments review 3 global developments: information reports by our private organisation, Alzheimer's Disease International (of which the Alzheimer's Association is a member), United Nations and World Health Organization reports and actions, which have recently increased and in which the US has played and could continue to play a helpful role.</p>
<p>Since 2009, <strong>ADI</strong> has issued major data reports about Alzheimer disease and related dementias worldwide. Each report is the product of scientific collaboration, led by an epidemiologist and full research team. I would highlight the most recent report, which provides the latest evidence of the medical and social benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis as a tool on which to base further work to fight the gap between prevalence estimates of 36 million worldwide and actually numbers of people diagnosed. It is estimated that probably no more than 1 in 4 people with dementia have received a formal diagnosis, which has been identified as a significant issue in the US draft plan framework and <em>Healthy People 2020</em> objectives.</p>
<p>In September 2011 the <strong>United Nations</strong> held only its second high-level meeting on a health issue in its history. This consultation on non-communicable diseases was held to debate a policy document and the final political declaration urges that member countries: "18. Recognize that mental and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the global non-communicable disease burden, for which there is a need to provide equitable access to effective programmes and health-care interventions."</p>
<p>This UN session directed the WHO to develop a series of targets, measures and indicators for reducing non-communicable diseases to be adopted by the World Health Assembly in its May 2012 meeting.</p>
<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong>'s involvement in Alzheimer's disease dates back to at least 1982, when it held an expert meeting on senile dementia. For many years most of the focus of the WHO has been through its mental health Programme (mhGap). The programme has produced a steady body of work for international professional and public health audiences about Alzheimer's and dementia. Our summary chart of all WHO publications is appended to these comments.</p>
<p>With WHO now deeply involved in follow-on planning from the NCD summit, efforts are underway to get Alzheimer's disease recognised as the fifth major non-communicable disease. <strong><em>However we need support from the US Government to make that happen and include Alzheimer's disease in the next NCD Strategy 2013-2020!</em></strong> Alzheimer's disease was used as an example of how ageing is a factor in the growing noncommunicable disease challenge in a recent resolution passed at the Assembly's executive meeting in January, and it is certain to be debated at the assembly meeting in May.</p>
<p><strong>WHO Global Report </strong></p>
<p>On April 11 2012 the World Health Organization will release a major global report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This is the result of collaboration with over 100 experts around the world to produce a volume similar in size and style to the world report on disabilities. Basic themes of the report will include the need for improved and coordinated research, more professional development of medical and non-medical staff, family caregiver support, and better linkages between health and social services in order to support people with Alzheimer's. The report will also focus on population risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, identifying what might be done in the public health sector to better define and reduce population risk of dementia. The prevalence/diagnosis gap is also a theme of the report and it has a section on small subpopulations of people with Alzheimer's disease, such as rural, minority language speaking, or people with Alzheimer's referred to as early or younger onset.</p>
<p>The WHO will signal that we are on the brink of a global health catastrophe. Across the world, 36 million people are living with dementia today. But unlike people with other serious conditions, their plight is very often not recognised. They will argue that their condition attracts only minimal research investment and a lack of awareness about adequate care and treatment mean their condition is often made needlessly worse than it needs to be. As the global population ages the problem will only get bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Collaborations </strong></p>
<p>Though there are many cross-national, scientific collaborations we suggest the following three that go beyond the bio-medical focus and highlight some of that work as suggestions for additional directions that international collaboration in research could foster.</p>
<p><strong>JPND</strong><br />
					The EU supports the European Union <strong>Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND)</strong> to facilitate trans-European research. The idea was launched in 2008 during the French presidency of the European Union. It is a major effort to improve EU alignment of scientific strategy on Alzheimer's disease and make best use of available resources. It now numbers 24 countries.</p>
<p>JPND major effort to date has been to collaboratively create a strategic research agenda to guide activity and investments. Just released, this strategy is based on the most complete compendium of current country-by-country efforts ever created. It lays out five scientific priorities and a robust set of cross-cutting enabling activities to move the strategy forward, of which two are unique when compared to the draft NAPA framework.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>healthcare and social care research goal</strong> identifies the major disconnect between health and social care systems and proposes research activities that may address the gap. Priority activities planned include coordinated studies to validate social care interventions, evaluation of pathways to treatment and support and their effectiveness, the effects of co-morbidity in dementia care and the study of assistive technologies.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>treatments and prevention goal</strong> includes a set of activities to examine psychosocial interventions and some population health activities, with a significant public health element of the strategic research agenda is using the planned European Health Examination Study to provide new Europe-wide data on the prevalence of people with early cognitive difficulties. This could be cross-walked with the CDC work on surveillance and compared to the ongoing effort adding cognitive questions to other population health studies such as NHANES, which could to lead to better understanding of population risk factors and the challenges of co-morbid chronic conditions existing with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Prevention and Risk Reduction Studies </strong></p>
<p>We would encourage the NAPA planners to begin to think about Alzheimer's disease as the fifth non-communicable disease, and to take advantage of growing evidence that demonstrates that some of the risk of Alzheimer's and dementia is modifiable, with many of the same risk factors as the other major NCDs.</p>
<p>We support additional careful study and our members are careful not to say "prevention of Alzheimer's" but there is sound science on risk reduction and several more large European dementia prevention studies are targeting cardio-vascular and lifestyle related risk factors which will report in 2012 and 2013. These are:</p>
<ul><li>The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER)</li>
<li>The Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (PreDIVA)</li>
<li>The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT)</li>
<li>The European Dementia Prevention Initiative is a new (2011) convening body of many of these collaborators. (<a href="http://www.edpi.org">http://www.edpi.org</a>)</li>
</ul><p>10/66 Dementia Research Group</p>
<p>The <strong>10/66 Dementia Research Group</strong> is a collective of researchers carrying out population-based research on dementia, non-communicable diseases and ageing in low and middle income countries 10/66 is a part of Alzheimer's Disease International, and is coordinated by the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. All protocols, survey instruments, and de-personalised 10/66 study datasets are available for secondary data analyses, subject to scientific and ethical review. The group has run carer intervention trials as well as validated measures for dementia identification in low resource countries, both of which might find application in the US with cultural or ethnic minorities.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP) is submitting these comments in response to the call for comments to the <strong><em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong>. The American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP), established in 1978, is a membership association of nearly 2000 geriatric psychiatrists, geriatricians, nurses, family physicians, psychologists, neurologists, social workers, pharmacists and other health professionals interested in mental health and older adults. AAGP promotes the mental health and well-being of older people through professional education, public advocacy, and support of career development for clinicians, educators, and researchers in geriatric psychiatry and mental health. AAGP's activities include substantial attention to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Geriatric psychiatrists and others in AAGP are involved in all aspects of national activities addressing Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, members in our organization are principal investigators of federally supported basic science and clinical services investigations regarding Alzheimer's disease; AAGP members are local and national advocates for individuals suffering with dementia and their family caregivers; AAGP members teach and train clinicians at all levels who care for patients with dementia; and, clinician members of AAGP often become the primary coordinator for care management of outpatients with moderate to severe illness, and necessary consultants in residential nursing home care.</p>
<p>From this perspective, AAGP applauds the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in implementing aspects of The National Alzheimer's Project Act, including the development of the current <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> (National Plan). Overall, in AAGP's opinion, the Draft National Plan in its current form has appropriate and commendable goals, and provides an excellent foundation for efforts towards achievement. AAGP remains concerned, however, that this ambitious plan has no explicit funds to implement the goals. The $50 million directed toward this program in 2012 and the proposed additional funding of $80 million will fall billions of dollars short of the appropriations needed to make the National Plan a reality. We urge the HHS to identify sources of funding in order to strengthen it. AAGP would contend that promulgating a plan of this importance without commensurate funding attached to its implementation creates a contradiction in the public's mind and can be demoralizing to everyone impacted by the National Plan including patients, families, clinicians, and the many others involved with the care and support of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>As noted, AAGP members are at the forefront of the research, clinical, and education arenas of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. However, as Constantine G. Lyketsos, MD, and David S. Miller, MD, (both long time members of the AAGP) noted in their article in <em>Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia (2012)</em>, Alzheimer's disease is not simply "a memory or cognitive disorder, (as) almost all individuals with AD develop one or more Neuropsychiatric Syndromes at some point in their disease." The lack of discussion in the National Plan of Alzheimer's disease as a mental health issue is startling and one that needs to be remedied. Neuropsychiatric syndromes of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to manage clinically and have a serious and disabling impact on both the patient as well as the caregiver. At the same time, there is a significant lack of knowledge on how to manage these conditions effectively. Health providers must be experts at managing these behaviors with non-pharmacologic therapies until evidence-based pharmacologic interventions are discovered. The National Plan must also recognize that it is the onset of the neuropsychiatric syndromes that often leads to assisted living or nursing home (long-term care) placement for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The current long-term care population includes a majority of patients with dementia and a large percentage of those patients have such behavioral abnormalities. In these settings issues that relate to these syndromes is the central component that worsens quality of life and leads to morbidity and mortality. Research needs to be conducted on a new long-term care model that accommodates these patients in environments that are not only safe, but also can help manage these symptoms so quality of life improves even as Alzheimer's progresses. AAGP believes it is critical that the National Plan both recognizes the existence of AD neuropsychiatric syndromes, and includes research and clinical care strategies on how to address them.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing the mental health of the patient with Alzheimer's disease, AAGP believes it is critical to also address the mental health of the family caregiver. Too often the caregivers of patients with AD suffer from depression, which can lead to disability and/or physical health issues as well as to the development of dementia. In any comprehensive plan on AD, the mental health of the caregiver must be included.</p>
<p>AAGP applauds HHS for including a section on the education of health care providers, recognizing the needs for training specific to the treatment and management of patients with AD. It is well known that all primary care health providers need better education/training in the treatment of patients with AD, but in certain cases subspecialist care by geriatric psychiatrists is necessary. For example, when a patient requires acute psychiatric care with a comorbid diagnosis of AD, a specially trained physician is required. However, due to several factors including insufficient Medicare reimbursement, the number of geriatric psychiatrists in the U.S. is decreasing concurrent with the increasing need for additional specialists to address the growing incidences of dementia. The Institute of Medicine will address some of these issues in its forthcoming report on the needed workforce for mental health of older adults, but the National Plan should also include additional specific strategies for this specialized care. The time is now to invest funds into both training of health care providers as well develop models of care to ensure that there are community care programs to provide quality care for individuals with AD. Although it will require an initial investment of funds, ultimately the community and the health care systems will save money as there will be a decreased burden on the family and health care system.</p>
<p>AAGP offers its assistance to HHS as it begins to implement the National Plan. We are in a position to assist in the dissemination of research as well as actively participate in the education initiatives. We have worked on developing dementia-based curricula as well as conducted hundreds of workshops on the diagnosis and treatment of AD, including the neuropsychiatric syndromes of AD. We offer AAGP as a partner organization to HHS in any and all of these efforts.</p>
<p>We applaud HHS for the development of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We agree that it is necessary for all of us to work together to be successful to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Please contact us if we can provide further information or support in the execution of the National Plan.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) congratulates the Advisory Council of the National Alzheimer's Project on the creation of the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (the draft plan). The draft plan is a major step forward in meeting the current and future challenges posed by progressive neurological diseases for the benefit of all who are affected by these devastating illnesses.</p>
<p>AFTD is honored to offer our input on behalf of the thousands of Americans living and working with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), a group of clinical disorders resulting from a progressive loss of neurons in the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. AD and FTD are related by pathological inclusions, often called neurofibrillary tangles, of the essential brain protein tau but differ in many critical ways. Memory loss, the characteristic symptom of AD, is rare in FTD and, when it does occur, is most often seen only during the later stages of FTD. The initial presentation of FTD can comprise a mix of symptoms, including: changes in behavior and personality diminished cognitive and executive functioning, language and communication problems, as well as motor impairments similar to those found in ALS or Parkinson's disease. FTD progresses unpredictably but inevitably results in complete dependence on medical care to sustain life during the final stages of the disease.</p>
<p>The average age of disease onset in FTD is in the late 50's, about a decade earlier than in AD. This difference poses special challenges shared only by the small percentage of people with the early-onset form of AD. Accessing insurance and finding appropriate health care for a debilitating neurological disease is a tremendous challenge for people under the age of retirement. Furthermore, the stigma associated with cognitive symptoms like dementia for people in their 40's-60's combined with a lack of public and professional awareness of FTD can create an overwhelming sense of isolation for people and families coping with FTD.</p>
<p>As an organization whose mission is devoted exclusively to this "related dementia", we believe that the inclusion of language in the draft plan explicitly addressing the distinct challenges posed by FTD and the related dementias will enable the proposed Actions and Strategies to better meet the needs of those affected by a non-Alzheimer's neurological disease. We strongly urge HHS to solicit input from experts and members of non-Alzheimer's disease communities and to specifically include such individuals as members of the task force detailed by Action 2.H.1 under Strategy 2.H.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevention and Treatment by 2025. </strong></p>
<p>AD and FTD are related through a shared underlying pathology. This connection offers exciting research prospects with enormous potential for AD and FTD patients alike. Therapeutic compounds that target the protein tau could have equally effective application for treating both diseases. FTD offers pharmaceutical companies opportunities for drug development not available with AD, such as a larger number of cases related to identified mutations on a small number of genes and a regulatory status to facilitate progress toward clinical drug trials. It is our sincere hope that the draft plan will stimulate aggressive efforts to exploit this point of mutual interest for the sake of both FTD and AD patients and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>The primary obstacle to the efficient delivery of high-quality care for FTD in any professional setting is the overwhelming lack of qualified providers experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of FTD. Obtaining a diagnosis of FTD often takes several years, an amount of time equal to ¼ or more of the total life expectancy for some patients, and like AD a definitive diagnosis is still only obtainable by autopsy. Ambiguity in diagnosis during the life of the patient complicates care, clinical trial recruitment, financial planning and all other aspects of coping with a neurodegenerative disease of any kind. Reliable diagnoses that accurately differentiate AD from FTD and all other related diseases would benefit everyone. Once diagnosed, the only professional care available to those with FTD is by providers who advertise services with phrases like "Memory Care" or "Dementia Services" that are intended for people with AD. Some who have FTD, especially people in their 50's or 60's, fail to realize that such resources even apply to them since they do not have memory problems and dementia is widely perceived as a condition that affects only senior citizens. In order to measure and improve care for people affected by FTD any quality improvement tool developed through the draft plan must include data, information, and content addressing the scarcity of professional expertise and knowledge of FTD and recognize the enormous challenge patients and families face in accessing appropriate healthcare services that is not experienced by most of those with AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expanded Support for Patients and Caregivers </strong></p>
<p>Due to the earlier average age of disease onset relative to AD, FTD is more likely to strike people who are still employed and raising a family and inevitably deprives them of their ability to function in either a professional or private capacity. FTD robs families of a parent, and makes experienced professionals incapable of successfully concluding a career. The paucity of public awareness and scarcity of professional expertise can combine with the debilitating symptoms of FTD and throw entire families into personal, financial, and legal turmoil prior to diagnosis. Thus magnifying the impact of FTD on not only the healthcare system, but all other social and legal systems well beyond what is expected of a rare disease. Currently the main source of support for FTD patients and caregivers is extended families, close friends, and perhaps most importantly, other FTD caregivers. The need for strategies and action to expand support for patients and caregivers around the unique challenges posed by FTD is desperate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Public awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>AFTD respectfully submits that without language explicitly describing the differences between the etiology, demographics and symptoms of FTD and AD, and the distinct challenges these differences impose on patients, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole, the draft plan will not successfully attain this goal for stakeholders involved with FTD. When FTD is subsumed under the phrase "related disorders" critical distinctions are lost, promoting the mistaken belief that dementia is a disease synonymous with AD rather than a symptom with a variety of causes. This, in turn, leads many healthcare professionals across all settings to treat people as if they have AD regardless of their actual diagnosis and provide them with inappropriate care which may even cause harm. Furthermore, when families and patients fail to respond as expected to the inappropriate care they receive they are too often denied care entirely rather than offered alternatives, exacerbating the sense of helplessness and the stigma that is all too common in those diagnosed with FTD. Unless more explicit attention is given to how FTD, and other neurological diseases differ from AD any increase in public awareness and engagement achieved through the draft plan will fail to fully benefit patients, families and caregivers coping with FTD and other neurological disease beside AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improved data infrastructure. </strong></p>
<p>Any data infrastructure created as part of the draft plan needs to be designed to include fields, criteria, and values specific to the impact of FTD, and other non-Alzheimer's diseases, on patients, families, and healthcare systems, if it is to benefit those with a neurological disease besides AD.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Geriatric Mental Health Alliance of New York Comments on the<br />
					Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Geriatric Mental Health Alliance of New York, I am writing in response to the draft National Alzheimer's Plan recently released for comment by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Geriatric Mental Health Alliance of New York is a 3,000 member advocacy and education organization formed to improve policy and practice for older adults with behavioral health needs.</p>
<p>We are delighted that a National Alzheimer's Plan is being developed in recognition of the vast growth of the number of people who will have Alzheimer's or other dementias during the elder boom, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft plan.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the draft plan is inadequate in several critical ways.</p>
<p><strong>Imbalance of Use of Funding</strong>: The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to deal with Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future, but it does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83%) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. That's less than $2 per person. This is simply not sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Attention to Research About Psychosocial Interventions</strong>: The clear tilt of the draft plan is towards research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. It seems to focus heavily on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. Prevention, cure, or effective slowing of the progression of dementia are, of course, much to be desired. But we do not believe that it is at all likely that this will be achieved by 2025--the goal of this plan--and even if it is, the millions of people who now have or will develop dementia prior to that will not be helped at all.</p>
<p>We know that psychosocial interventions can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers, but we need to know more--to develop truly evidence-based practices. We strongly urge those developing the research plan to pay much more attention to research about psychosocial interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Attention to Mental Disorders Commonly Experienced by People with Dementia and their Caregivers</strong>: People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. (See Lyketsos, et al) When this happens, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. Yet, the role of the mental health system is barely reflected in the draft plan.</p>
<p>In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. There are evidence-based family support interventions. (See Mittelman). The need for supports for family caregivers is noted in the plan, but briefly and with little substance.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that failure to address issues of mental health will result in continued failure to meet fundamental needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb is pleased to submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, released by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation on January 9, 2012.</p>
<p>We recommend that the Plan include these additional elements:</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<ol><li>Identify Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a multidecade process eventuating in predementia symptoms and the functional impairments of dementia</li>
<li>Recognize biomarkers as key to diagnosis and treatment
<ol><li>Support partnerships advancing biomarker development and qualification</li>
<li>Develop medical infrastructure for clinical use of biomarkers</li>
<li>Set access standards to ensure access to biomarkers in clinical practice</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Ensure that diagnosis and treatment algorithms reflect patient differences, to support individualized treatment for each patient</li>
<li>Promote partnerships of government, academe, industry, and advocacy groups, to foster patient recruitment and AD treatment development programs</li>
<li>Examine routes to both accelerate development of acute treatments, learning from the HIV model, and to support long-term prevention studies.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<ol><li>Establish the optimum age and tests for cognitive screening for all primary care patients.</li>
<li>Evaluate the deployment of specialized memory clinics for early diagnosis, treatment, and clinical trial enrollment, as deployed in other countries</li>
<li>Ensure incentives are in place to secure a sufficient supply of qualified professional and paraprofessional care staff</li>
<li>Ensure access to innovative therapies for AD
<ol><li>Provide comprehensive coding, coverage, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease at the predementia and dementia stages</li>
<li>Ensure new clinical evidence is adopted into coverage and payment policies in a timely manner so that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools</li>
<li>Encourage adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<ol><li>Develop and promote care infrastructure, financial planning, and behavior management strategies to support patients in their homes and in residential care.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong></p>
<ol><li>Foster AD understanding in a campaign educating payers, patients, families, and health care professionals to recognize and overcome stigma related to AD.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong></p>
<ol><li>Announce metrics, measureable annual goals and report on them.</li>
</ol><p>We would be happy to expand on these suggestions for improving the Draft Framework to better address the social and medical needs of Americans who have Alzheimer's disease and their families. Please contact me if you would us to provide any additional information.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Area Planning and Services Committee (APSC) on Aging with Lifelong Disabilities, I am sending a letter in response to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute our thoughts and congratulate you and the council on its initiative. Best wishes,</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Area Planning and Services Committee (APSC) on Aging with Lifelong Disabilities, which I serve as chairman, respectfully wishes to make comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The APSC is a regional coalition comprised of some two dozen organizational and individual members from Chesterfield, Hanover, and Henrico counties and the city of Richmond, Virginia, representing intellectual disabilities, parks and recreation, residential services, blindness and visual impairment, communities of faith, higher education, family caregivers, and more.</p>
<p>The APSC works to address both the opportunities and challenges that present themselves as more adults with lifelong disabilities grow into later life. In effect, the APSC acts as a creative form of <em>de facto</em> public policy, trying to respond in the present to issues that formal regulations have not yet incorporated. For instance, how can aging-related services that are offered only to adults ages 60 and above respond to persons with lifelong disabilities who may manifest "aging" behaviors prematurely? In response, the APSC offers training workshops and statewide conferences, has developed health screening tools and DVDs on healthy diets and nutrition for adults with lifelong disabilities, and more.</p>
<p>Increasingly, service providers and family caregivers are pressing us for more focus on matters related to dementia with intellectual disabilities and other developmental disabilities. Our fall 2011 workshop did and our June 2012 statewide conference will concentrate on dementia care with lifelong disabilities. Adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities present new challenges to providers and families. Premature expression of Alzheimer's Disease by adults with Down syndrome generally precludes their engagement in aging-related services funded by the Older American Act which stipulates age 60 for eligibility. Dementia disrupts group homes for individuals with lifelong disabilities, for it overwhelms staff's ability to respond in the face of other continuing needs by those without dementia and breaks the bond of community that the adults with disabilities have developed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the overwhelming majority of today's older adults with lifelong disabilities have grown old in family contexts, in the care of their parents, not in an institutional setting. These caregiving parents, now quite advanced in age, are often under-recognized and under-reinforced by outside services, and the presentation of dementia is often more than they can handle. There are today about one million adults with lifelong developmental disabilities who have reached age 60 and beyond. Again, the great majority have done so through the continuing care of the parent and families. These parents and families need and deserve help.</p>
<p>The Draft National Plan does make mention of intellectual disabilities but we respectfully request that the Draft National Plan make a fuller focus, to include at least the following:</p>
<ol><li>Attention to the special circumstances attendant upon the relatively premature expression of dementia among adults with Down syndrome, an expression that occurs before the individual's own eligiblity for aging-related services funded by the Older Americans Act.</li>
<li>Attention to the expression of dementia among adults with other developmental disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, non-Down intellecual disabilities) and the consequences of the co-morbidity of dementia and the lifelong disability.</li>
<li>Attention to the growing need of managers, service providers, and policy makers with the developmental disabilities service sector for high quality training on Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias, training that includes both conceptual and practical day-to-day management content.</li>
<li>Attention to the public reliance upon family caregivers as the mainstay of the long-term care system, as it relates to aging with lifelong disabilities, and to the critical needs of thse family caregivers for training in and support about caring for someone with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities who develops Alzheimer's Disease or another dementia.</li>
</ol><p>We thank you for considering our recommendations. With best wishes, I remain</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA)</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Alzheimer's Association, Connecticut Chapter, we want to thank you for allowing us to provide public comment on the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p>The Connecticut Chapter is grateful to the administration for making Alzheimer's disease a national priority. We believe the establishment of the plan is a positive step toward beginning to address many challenges, including quality of care, family and caregiver support and the development of new treatments and early detection diagnosis and interventions.</p>
<p><strong>The National Alzheimer's Project Act NAPA </strong></p>
<p>Much of the draft plan focuses on evaluation and assessment of current programs. While these are valuable steps, we encourage the Administration to quickly move from assessment to action for the families touched by this disease.</p>
<p>The plan identifies several challenges that emerged from the Alzheimer's Association's public input process and outlines a framework to begin the implementation process. Ten key issues include: a lack of public awareness, insufficient research funding, difficulties with diagnosis, poor dementia care, inadequate treatments, unprepared caregivers, ill-equipped communities, mounting costs, specific challenges facing diverse communities and those with younger-onset Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The Chapter thanks the President for taking immediate action to fight Alzheimer's disease with the historic investment of $156 million in research funding with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and supporting people with Alzheimer's disease and their families in educating the public and providers. On the other hand, statistics suggest $2 billion will be necessary to find a cure to halt the disease. It is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and the 5th leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. Alzheimer's is the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure or even slow its progression. Furthermore, deaths from Alzheimer's have increased 66 percent between 2000 and 2008, while deaths from other major diseases, including the number one cause of death (heart disease), decreased. Yet, each of these diseases has received between $2 to $8 billion each for the last few years from NIH. Meanwhile, Alzheimer's has been flat-funded at $595 million. It is clear that research funding has helped lower the death rates for other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The Association is grateful for the administration's goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. However, statistics suggest treatments will need to be accelerated to change the trajectory of the disease or it will triple by 2050.</p>
<p>The plan realizes the need for an adequate supply of culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills, ranging from direct-care workers to community health and social workers to primary care providers and specialists from the point of diagnosis onward in settings including doctor's offices, hospitals, community-based home care and nursing homes. Further, given the complex care needs of people with Alzheimer's disease, high-quality and efficient care is dependent on smooth transitions between care settings and coordination among healthcare and long-term services and support providers. Provider training is essential to effectively detect Alzheimer's disease and caring for people affected by this devastating disease.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's and the Aging Network </strong></p>
<p>The plan provides for HHS to coordinate with states to develop dementia-capable long-term services and support systems and improve the Alzheimer's disease capability of the workforce in their state aging plans. These strategies may include enhancing Alzheimer's disease competencies among Aging Network staff, developing AD-capable community health and long-term care Options Counseling in Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and linking State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen programs to AD-specific training and resources.</p>
<p>Since much of the work required to support caregivers and the direct-care workforce should and will occur at the local level, the state should develop a state plan to tackle Alzheimer's disease. Currently, Connecticut does not have a state plan to address Alzheimer's disease. The state plan would create the infrastructure necessary to build dementia-capable programs for the growing number of people with the disease.</p>
<p>Understanding the enormous stress the disease places on family members and the healthcare system, developing early interventions is necessary to effectively serve and meet the unique needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. A comprehensive assessment and strategy to bring local stakeholders together to address the needs of persons with Alzheimer's disease is recommended on the state level. The collection of testimonials through town forums could be gathered identifying and quantifying the number of individuals with Alzheimer's in the state. The forums could provide the opportunity to elicit the opinions of the general public. As achieved on the national level, an advisory council should be formed in Connecticut. Membership should include: key legislative leaders, the Office of Policy and Management representatives, state agency representatives and community-based groups, persons with Alzheimer's family and professional caregivers, health professionals from hospitals and primary care, residential and community care providers and Alzheimer's Association representatives.</p>
<p>With the multitude of issues to examine as part of state plan development, workgroups can be formed to tackle specialty areas of expertise. In fact twenty-three states have published a state Alzheimer's plan to create the infrastructure to build dementia-capable programs for the growing number of people with the disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association, Connecticut Chapter appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments on the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In summary, the Chapter agrees earlier diagnosis of the disease and coordinated strategies among the Aging Network for long-term services and supports need to be developed on the state level to meet the growing demands of persons with the disease and their caregivers. Finally, accelerated research and funding for a cure is imminently needed to achieve savings in billions of dollars to the health care system.</p>

<p>2.F. Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</p>
<p>The Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is an outstanding model of care for persons living with Alzheimer's Disease and other memory disorders. As high as two thirds of the PACE participants have cognitive impairment. Utilizing an interdisciplinary team, PACE provides comprehensive, coordinated and integrated care to individuals age 55 and older who meet the nursing home level of care criteria. The goal is to maintain the individual in a non-instituional setting for as long as possible. This program is a three way agreement between the PACE organization, CMS and the state Medicaid agency. Although PACE is currently serving 22,000 individuals nationally, the plan is to significantly increase this program. Research supports the efficacy of this model and should be referenced in your plan.</p>
<p>3.B. Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</p>
<p>More funding is needed for individuals on Medicare that need in-home care. My father was diagnosed with dementia in September of 2010 and passed away in April 2011. During his illness, my mother had to pay out of pocket for three attendants because he did not qualify for Medicaid until the end of his life. The process took several months before a determination was made by the Medicaid Long Term Care Office. Finally, one month before his death, he was deemed eligible with a share of cost. The experience was very challenging for all our family. Moreover, funding for caregiver resources and support have been drastically cut by the State of California. This makes no sense with the anticipated increase of persons with Alzheimer's Disease and other long term illnesses. The federal government needs to step in and assess what states are doing to help caregivers. Otherwise, vulnerable populations will continue to be adversely impacted. It is important for federal entities such as CMS, HRSA and AOA to work together to address these issues and to identify the funding that is vitally needed by families across the nation.</p>
<p>The Napa Advisory Council has been doing excellent work to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the nationwide epidemic of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
<ul><li>It is critical that this plan address the needs of the growing numbers of people living with this disease and their families</li>
<li>Several aspects of the plan focus on these issues but do not identify funding for implementation</li>
<li>The Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP) which is also known and the Alzheimer's Disease Federal-State Matching Grants Program is the one federal program that has provided focused support for this population in local communities.</li>
<li>The NAPA report may want to reference AoA's support through the ADSSP program for sections of the plan including:
<ul><li>2.C.2 Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</li>
<li>2.H Improve care for populations disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease and for populations facing care challenges</li>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>

We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease. At the outset, let me express my appreciation and gratitude to everyone who is a part of this community: researchers, caregivers, affected individuals, and families who spend day in and day out caring for our loved ones.</p>
<p>I am providing these comments by way of my son Cole, who was born with an extra 21st chromosome. Since his birth, I have learned a great deal about the direct correlation between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. For example, I have learned that Alzheimer's disease attacks adults with Down syndrome at a younger age and with increased frequency compared to the general population. I have also learned that the pathological findings of Alzheimer's disease have been described in the brains of people with Down syndrome since the 1800s and that there are genetic factors at play that, in part, explain these pathologic and clinical observations. I further understand that NIH is funding Down syndrome research using natural history and imaging techniques to identify early markers of cognitive decline. These studies will undoubtedly help people with Down syndrome, but they will also have a broader application to those individuals in the general population who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Yet, there is so much more that can be learned from this relationship. I believe that both the Alzheimer's and Down syndrome communities would benefit greatly from additional conversations about this unique scientific correlation. To that end, I would encourage you to include a representative from the Down syndrome research community on the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>It has been just over one year since the National Alzheimer's Project was enacted. By recognizing the specific link between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease in the National Alzheimer's Project, the Council would be including all of the most current scientific data available. More importantly, millions of American's who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease will benefit from the research that is already underway in those with Down syndrome. This is truly a win-win for the entire community.</p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts to develop a national plan to address the growing crisis of Alzheimer's Disease. In 2009 the San Francisco Department of Aging and Adult Services published a Strategic Plan for Excellence in Dementia Care which we are in the process of implementing. Our work has been informed by experts in this field, including the Alzheimer's Association of Northern California and Northern Nevada. As we work to implement our plan we know that a National Plan has the potential to enhance and possibly even advance our efforts locally.</p>
<p>One very clear theme that permeated every workgroup in the process of developing our Strategy for Excellence in Dementia Care was the need for education and training. Not only were family caregivers desperate for education, information and training, but also, first responders, public transportation workers, airport staff, health professionals including physicians and disability agencies, wanted to be better informed and able to refer persons with Dementia and their Care partners to appropriate resources early in the disease process. We currently have a project funded through the Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program that supports the goal of education and training as defined in our Strategic Plan. This project , a partnership between our Department, the Alzheimer's Association, University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente of San Francisco is testing ways to reduce hospitalizations by providing Caregiver support and education on best practices in Alzheimer's and dementia care to individuals who are part of Kaiser Permanente.</p>
<p>In reviewing the National Plan I do not see any reference to the ADSSP. This concerns me as I believe that ADSSP is the only federally funded program that uniquely targets dementia patients and their families with support and educational services which are as yet not considered "evidenced based practices" but are based on sound assumptions about care</p>
<p>San Francisco is a very diverse city, and yet in our program we are able to target only English speaking Caregivers and persons with Dementia because we do not have enough funding to broaden our study at this time. However, our expectation is that this information gained will give us information that would help fund the part of the plan devoted to populations disproportionately affected by Alzheimer 's disease and populations facing care challenges, such as those from racial and ethnic minorities. This program supports and educates people with the disease and care partners, which is a significant concern addressed in the plan.</p>
<p>We are concerned that the ADSSP funding may be eliminated. I urge you to use the NAPA planning process to assure that funding for programs that are still small and in development but have the opportunity to teach us much about establishing best practices and continues to help develop services for under-served, at-risk populations. This is the ONLY federal program supporting this work for patients with Alzheimer's Disease Care partners and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the National Alzheimer's Project Act. It is a wonderful undertaking and we are privileged to be part of the process.</p>

<p>I would like to share with you about our social model, senior adult day center which is certified by the state of Kentucky and is the first social model that is private pay only in Kentucky:</p>
<p>I own Care4Ever Senior Care Center in Elizabethtown, KY. It opened July 1st, 2009 and we have experienced caring for several dementia participants since it opened and how exciting to experience families seeing their loved one with dementia participating in activities in the center, laughing, and being active. One activity so many of those with dementia have liked is the game "Corn Hole". What a simple game, but oh the fun, laughter and exercise that can be gained by that simple bean bag and a hole in a board! Our center was designed to be "like home" and it is comfortable, beautiful and very home-like. Nothing institutional here! I have talked with the VA in Louisville several times about using social model centers for veterans, but to no avail! Medical models are all they use and approve. My other company, Tender Touch Senior Services, which provides in-home, non-medical care to senior adults here in Elizabethtown, serving Hardin Co and the surrounding counties, is in the Homemaker Program with the VA and we go into the homes of nearly 45 veterans in our area and they would get so much more out of coming to the center combined with their homemaking and personal care in their home. My vision reaches so very far, with adult social model day centers, but I get frustrated because so very many people, as they are wearing out from caregiving, only look to nursing homes. We are trying to educate as many people as we can on the wonderful offerings of the social day center, but many times by the time the family gets their loved one with dementia to our center, it is only to buy time until they can place them into a facility. Our staff cries every time someone goes into a nursing home, because we can see that many times they are not ready to go into a facility, but the family is too worn out to even think.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I could go on and on!</p>

<p>We applaud the efforts of the Council and their Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. This Plan represents a major step forward in the development of a comprehensive strategy for addressing the impact of this devastating condition that affects millions of Americans and their families. While we agree with the overall goals established by the Plan, we offer the following recommendations for your consideration, based on our own experience in the long-term care industry:</p>
<ul><li>Under Goal 2, we recommend an additional strategy focused on the creation of a national provider quality database that includes assisted living and home care agencies that are not already monitored by HHS</li>
<li>Under Strategy 2.E, we encourage the evaluation of community-based adult day services as an alternative to home or institutional care</li>
<li>Under Strategy 2.F, we encourage additional education and resources to help families make the optimal decisions about situs of care and potential timing of transitions</li>
<li>Under Strategy 2.G, we encourage incentives based on outcomes for acute care that are designed to help minimize ongoing long-term care costs</li>
<li>Under Goal 3, we recommend an additional strategy focused on strengthening people's knowledge of, and access to, long-term care providers and resources.</li>
<li>Under Goal 3, we recommend an additional strategy focused on the use of assistive technology to aid in the caregiving and support services for those affected with Alzheimer's</li>
<li>Under Strategy 3.B, we recommend focusing more broadly on overall caregiver wellness programs</li>
<li>Under Strategy 3.C.2, we recommend leveraging the lessons learned from the "Own Your Future" awareness campaign as a successful model to help drive awareness about long-term care planning</li>
<li>Under Goal 5, we encourage engaging the LTCI industry for the purpose of leveraging industry data for potential research partnerships that study type of care, how/where care is delivered, quality of care and change in care needs over time. We believe that industry data represents the single largest identifiable pool of information regarding long term care support services and Alzheimer's.</li>
</ul><p>Again, we appreciate the opportunity to provide our insights and look forward to providing more detailed information regarding our recommendations at your request.</p>

<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia. In addition, as a parent or family member, I am aware of the need to provide special supports for caregivers, often siblings or aging parents, who assume responsibilities for the care needs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia.</p>
<p>It is also case that these individuals have special needs that may differ and require different supports than those provided to individuals in the general population. These needs have been identified by the National Task Group and Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices in an action plan it issued as part of its report: My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports", which has been submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have the need for research and population specific clinical trials identified specifically and clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as well as the care challenges they face that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports.</p>
<p>We are working with many families who are facing this very issue and the numbers are growing. As Executive Director of one of the largest Down syndrome associations in the country, and as a member of the DSAGC Health Professional Advisory Board who also serves as a consultant for the DSAGC who specializes in helping these families, we strongly urge the Council to consider the aging families who are dealing with aging children with Down syndrome who are most likely going to end up with this painful diagnosis. It is devastating diagnosis for families who have fought so hard to provide lifelong opportunities for their loved one...and then to have those opportunities taken away because of Alzheimer's disease is tragic to watch.</p>
<p>Please include us in the national study.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Comments from the Professional Affairs &amp; Information Committee, National Academy of Neuropsychology</strong></p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN), a professional association with 3,500 members dedicated to the advancement of neuropsychology as a science and health profession for the benefit of the culturally diverse patients and caregivers that we serve.</p>
<p>Clinical neuropsychologists are licensed, independent doctoral level practitioners with special expertise in the applied science of brain-behavior relationships. We provide neurocognitive assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and integrated support of culturally diverse patients (and their caregivers) suffering from a variety of neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD; cf. Goals 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the Draft HHS Plan). Our patients are referred by a variety of medical specialties. Neuropsychological assessment measures brain functioning with standardized, well-researched tests of attention, processing, memory, language, spatial, motor, sensory, and executive functions as well as social-emotional aspects of behavior and mood (cf. NINCDS-ADRDA, Goal 1 of the Draft HHS Plan). This information aids diagnosis, medical management, placement, and practical life-related patient and caregiver decisions and can stage disease progression and recovery (consequent to future biological interventions). Neuropsychologists are most often located in metropolitan areas, but many have developed part time rural practices to serve outlying communities, and consult with general clinical psychologists and primary care physicians in rural areas.</p>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the effort and diligence of the HHS staff and of the National Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in guiding the agenda for AD research and services which will positively impact the lives of the patients and caregivers that all of us serve. We would also like to thank you for including Psychology in your revised document, given the role that many psychologists play in service to AD patients and caregivers via research, education, and direct services. While neuropsychologists and psychologists share many things in common, neuropsychologists are more specialized in their knowledge of brain-behavior relationships, neuroanatomy, biological bases of cognition and behavior, standardized neurocognitive assessment, and management of neurodegenerative diseases (such as AD). Neuropsychologists frequently consult with their clinical/counseling psychologist colleagues and provide additional highly specialized diagnostic and intervention planning services for the benefit of AD patients and their caregivers. Below we will provide information regarding the critical role that neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment plays in AD diagnosis, treatment, education, and research, specifically with regard to linking biomarkers to neurobehavioral phenotypes and clinical presentation. Currently neuropsychology and neurocognitive assessment are not acknowledged in the draft HHS plan. We hope to persuade you to redress this omission.</p>
<p>We want to highlight that neuropsychologists already play an active and instrumental role in AD research (e.g., via understanding the neurocognitive and behavioral profile of the disease, determining early clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, and providing the neurocognitive clinical correlates needed for biomarker research). Neuropsychology also plays a key role in education (e.g., to other medical professionals, to patients and caregivers) and direct care of AD patients and their caregivers (e.g., innovative quality of life programs). Your acknowledgement of neuropsychology's role in the future direction of care and research in AD will help to perpetuate neuropsychology's involvement in research and innovative service programs of importance to the Alzheimer's community. Conversely, exclusion of neuropsychologists from the Draft HHS Plan may limit opportunities for neuropsychologists to remain active in AD research, education, and clinical service, and this could seriously disadvantage AD patients and caregivers who are amidst the AD experience.</p>
<p>Specifically, we seek to have neuropsychology included in (1) <strong>Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong>, which stresses the importance of the use of biological markers in the diagnosis of AD. Currently, this section of the document fails to recognize the importance of neuropsychological/neurocognitive markers of the AD phenotype that are currently the gold standard for determining the presence and progression of AD. Additionally, (2) inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct service providers (Strategy 2.A., below) is also critical to AD patients and caregivers needing this help.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>Regarding Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression, we offer the following wording suggestions for your consideration (italics ours):</p>
<p><em>Under Strategy 1.C: "Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids <strong>in relation to neuropsychological manifestations</strong> have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, ..." </em></p>
<p><em>and/or </em></p>
<p><em>Action 1.C.1: "Identify imaging and biomarkers <strong>in relation to sensitive neuropsychological measures</strong> to monitor disease progression." </em></p>
<p>In support of these suggestions we offer the following information and references:</p>
<p>Neurocognitive decline is the hallmark of AD, and according to the NIH neurocognitive assessment is essential to the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, along with clinical history (symptoms and their course), medical tests (such as blood work), and neuroimaging (<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). Also, While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for AD has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data,<sup>1,2</sup> which are hallmarks of neuropsychological evaluation at very sensitive and detailed levels.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup> Further, neuropsychologists are listed by the NIH along with Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists, and Neurologists, as specialists in assessment who can provide detailed diagnosis of AD(<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). In fact, clinical neuropsychologists often field referrals from the other three specialties mentioned by the NIH to provide very detailed assessments to assist in their patient evaluations, and often refer to the other specialists for the benefit of AD patients.</p>
<p>Neuropsychology has significantly advanced the research exploring biological markers of Alzheimer disease through the development of very sensitive neurocognitive tests; tests that are critical to early identification of neurocognitive decline (complementing Strategy 1:C of the HHS draft document).<sup>5</sup> In fact, it is not uncommon for a detailed neuropsychological evaluation to detect progressive neurocognitive decline before pathology is observed on neuroimaging such as brain MRI. Such work has assisted countless AD patients and their caregivers to enhance what time they have left, and is now being effectively used by physicians to initiate and monitor the effects of dementia delaying medications (such as cholinesterase inhibitors).</p>
<p>In the final analysis, however, there is still much that needs to be learned of the relationship between AD biomarkers and neurocognitive/functional (neuropsychological) symptoms and outcomes. As Jeffrey Cummings, M.D., noted expert on dementing conditions, has written:</p>
<p><em>The predictive relationship between biomarker changes and clinical outcomes is critical to their successful utilization in AD drug development programs. This is not known for any AD-related biomarker. Preliminary correlations have been established for some clinical outcomes and some biomarkers; it is unknown if changes in a biomarker (such as reduced MRI ventricular enlargement with treatment) will correlate with reduced decline in cognition or function following treatment (p.1482).<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p>Dr. Cummings' insightful comments lead to at least three conclusions based on the totality of biomarker research to date. First, more work needs to be done, including continued development of very sensitive standardized neuropsychological measures in relation to biomarkers for earlier identification of AD (as a clinical syndrome). Second, while there may be a correlation between biomarkers and clinical manifestations, the correlation is not perfect. Consequently, AD remains a clinical diagnosis at present, and the measurement of neurocognitive decline or enhancement (based on biological intervention) still requires detailed standardized neuropsychological assessment results (i.e., standardized and objective clinical correlates) to help press forward in biomarker research and to benefit AD sufferers. Third, neuropsychological measures are needed within the research itself as the best current means of characterizing the disease for which biomarkers are sought (i.e., neuropsychological markers remain the gold standard for biomarker research).</p>
<p><strong>2. Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct care providers: While clinical neuropsychology and clinical psychology are related, and often work together in a complementary manner in the community for the benefit of AD patients and caregivers, they are not the same specialty. Consequently, we suggest that you consider including "neuropsychologists" (along with "psychologists") as distinct additional providers within "The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease..." (Strategy 2.A.), and also in receiving HHS information regarding "...dementia curricula and practice recommendations..." (Action 2.A.3).</p>
<p>In closing, NAN again applauds your efforts to aggressively address AD, and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this endeavor. Thank you for your time in reviewing our comments. Please direct any comments, questions, or concerns to us via the NAN central office.</p>

<p>AgeOptions, the Area Agency on Aging for the suburban Chicago region since 1974, supports the goals set forth in the National Alzheimer's Plan. The Aging Network plays a strong role in supporting older adults with Alzheimer's and their families and we appreciate our inclusion in many areas of the Plan, including strengthening the state aging workforce and providing education, training and support.</p>
<p>In order to make the National Plan inclusive and responsive to the needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, we recommend that the Advisory Council include the following in the Plan:</p>
<ul><li>Stronger emphasis on caregiver support services. It is crucial that caregivers are supported in order to ensure that they are able to provide high quality of care and that people with Alzheimer's disease are able to stay in their homes as long as possible. Local Area Agencies on Aging have been providing caregiver support services since 2001 through funding provided by the Older Americans Act. These services include support groups, caregiver counseling, caregiver training programs and respite care options. While these programs are utilized by all caregivers, many clients care for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, Area Agencies on Aging provide outreach and education to caregivers and information and referral services to connect caregivers with appropriate resources.</li>
<li>Collaboration at the local level. The National Alzheimer's Plan focuses primarily on national and state organizations. It is essential to include local Area Agencies on Aging, providers, the faith based community and stakeholders in the discussions and plans. Local organizations in our area provide programming and services for people with Alzheimer's and their families, including evidence based programs, case management, support groups, respite care and information and referral. These local organizations must be included in the Plan in order to ensure that individuals in need of Alzheimer's support services have full access to the benefits that will result from this national initiative.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Response to Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease: Submitted on behalf of the Health Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN)</strong></p>
<p>The Healthy Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN) strongly supports the vision statement of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) presented by President Barack Obama, which aims to alleviate the suffering and burden associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to "<em>confront the challenge it poses to our public health</em>."</p>
<p>The Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN) was formed in 2001 to help develop and implement a national research and dissemination agenda related to the public health aspects of healthy aging. The HAN consists of a coordinating center, seven member and affiliate universities, and representation from and participation by over 10 national agencies with interests in the well-being of older adults, including AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, the American Medical Association, the US Administration on Aging, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, the National Council on Aging, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This network has played a vital role in national initiatives to ensure the inclusion of AD, cognitive impairment, and cognitive health promotion in the Healthy People 2020 Older Adult objectives. The network has also worked successfully to inform the National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health, released in June 2007 by the CDC and the Alzheimer's Association [1].</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2009, the HAN conducted community-based research with over 600 diverse older adults, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese, with representation from African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic White communities, in urban and rural locations across nine states. [2-4]. Theseolder adults and those who care for older adults represent the stakeholders to whom NAPA is targeted. Findings from this large-scale, multi-site initiative (published in The Gerontologist, volume 49, supplement 1, June 2009) indicated that older adults, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or geographic region, agree that cognitive health is essential to healthy aging [5, 6]. Older adults also stated that existing media messages about cognitive health and its association with lifestyle factors can be conflicting and confusing [7]. It is imperative that researchers, educators, and policymakers continue to examine communication strategies to better inform the public about the evolving science of maintaining cognitive health and reducing the risk of cognitive impairment. Based on its strong track record, the HAN is well positioned to participate in such efforts.</p>
<p>As currently written, the NAPA does not explicitly state the impact of AD and other dementias on public health or the role that public health can play in this important area. We therefore strongly recommend the explicit inclusion of HAN expertise in public health research and practice in addressing each of the goals outlined in the NAPA. This document provides recommendations for roles that the HAN might fill in implementing the Plan.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>Public health has a long history of fielding prevention research and educational efforts in multiple chronic diseases such as heart disease, musculoskeletal disease, and cancer. HAN member centers have helped develop, evaluate, and implement successful health promotion programs in primary care, senior centers, and other community-based organizations. HAN researchers, in partnership with community collaborators, have developed and tested effective, evidence-based, and widely-used older adult exercise programs, including EnhanceFitness[8-9], Fit and Strong! [10, 11], and A Matter of Balance [12-14] and have demonstrated chronic illness risk reduction and improved health outcomes in these investigations. Although research is still needed about the impact of such lifestyle changes on AD [15], epidemiological and early randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show promise [16]. A cadre of experts within the HAN can help advance this work, both by conducting focused reviews of existing literature and large datasets, and by planning and implementing large scale lifestyle-enhancing initiatives. In addition, as noted above, the HAN has a proven track record in partnering with diverse groups who represent the growing numbers of racial and ethnic minorities in the US and recruiting them to participate in research and the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Initiatives focused on expanding dementia-specific capabilities in primary care settings are already underway within the HAN. HAN centers have examined primary care providers' perceptions and practices regarding AD and cognitive impairment [17, 18]. A current CDC-funded Special Interest Project (SIP 10-37; PI: M. Snowden) is reviewing the scientific literature to determine the impact of cognitive impairment on co-occurring chronic illnesses, including morbidity, mortality, and how AD and dementias influence the medical care that an individual receives. The project will also identify and catalogue the elements of existing research databases for use in future studies to better understand the relationship between dementia and chronic conditions. The HAN member centers' established associations with racial and ethnic minority, low income, and rural populations provide resources and expertise for assessing and addressing the complications and obstacles faced by these groups who are at high risk for inadequate health care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for more broadly distributed evidence-based services through involvement of a variety of service providers, including State Health Departments, Area Agencies on Aging, non-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, and other facilities within local communities. Public health has a long history of working within these organizations, and can help mobilize communities to meet these challenges. HAN members and affiliates are actively engaged in working with the Administration on Aging (AoA) in this effort (e.g., University of Washington HAN investigators are currently working with the states of Washington, Oregon, and Ohio on translating evidence-based interventions for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers into existing community health systems [19]).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services should take advantage of the formative investigation already conducted by the HAN that was cited earlier [2-7]. This investigation found low health literacy and lack of access to culturally relevant information about cognitive health across all ethnic and language groups, and in both rural and urban environments. Older adults often reported that recommendations that they heard were ambiguous, contradictory, or impossible to comply with, and recommendations from health providers were often vague and lacked specific planning processes [7]. Thus, there is an urgent need for culturally and educationally appropriate materials and resources for individuals with cognitive impairment, individuals at risk for dementia, caregivers, and providers. The HAN comprehensive data set can provide guidance about messages and media that will be most effective in disseminating this information. The HAN has tremendous reach for public health and aging focused message testing and awareness campaign development, implementation, and evaluation.</p>
<p>In addition, each HAN site has worked for over 10 years with community advisory groups to facilitate communication between and among state and local government agencies, nonprofit partners, racial and ethnic minority service providers, and academic public health researchers. These partnerships have actively developed and disseminated healthy aging programs, and can be leveraged to promote dementia-prevention education and intervention programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Track Progress and Drive Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Public health researchers have long been instrumental in evaluating large-scale programs to promote health in older adults, including both lifestyle (e.g., exercise, nutrition) and primary prevention (e.g., immunization) interventions. Any effort to measure and evaluate the impact of NAPA on health outcomes for older adults and caregivers and on policy change must be informed by public health, taking advantage of existing expertise in population-level evaluation planning, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. The HAN has been involved in developing aging-specific questions for a number of large surveys [18, 20], and has a long history of experience and expertise in this area. It should be noted that the CDC Healthy Aging Program (funder of the HAN) developed a 10-question Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011; an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 (total 38 states, including the District of Columbia). The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including the states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In summary, to achieve the goals of NAPA, collaboration with and among public health researchers across the nation is needed. The HAN is an example of a successful and productive collaborative effort, and we look forward to helping move the science forward to address this important public health issue.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Comments from the Professional Affairs &amp; Information Committee, National Academy of Neuropsychology</strong></p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN), a professional association with 3,500 members dedicated to the advancement of neuropsychology as a science and health profession for the benefit of the culturally diverse patients and caregivers that we serve.</p>
<p>Clinical neuropsychologists are licensed, independent doctoral level practitioners with special expertise in the applied science of brain-behavior relationships. We provide neurocognitive assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and integrated support of culturally diverse patients (and their caregivers) suffering from a variety of neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD; cf. Goals 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the Draft HHS Plan). Our patients are referred by a variety of medical specialties. Neuropsychological assessment measures brain functioning with standardized, well-researched tests of attention, processing, memory, language, spatial, motor, sensory, and executive functions as well as social-emotional aspects of behavior and mood (cf. NINCDS-ADRDA, Goal 1 of the Draft HHS Plan). This information aids diagnosis, medical management, placement, and practical life-related patient and caregiver decisions and can stage disease progression and recovery (consequent to future biological interventions). Neuropsychologists are most often located in metropolitan areas, but many have developed part time rural practices to serve outlying communities, and consult with general clinical psychologists and primary care physicians in rural areas.</p>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the effort and diligence of the HHS staff and of the National Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in guiding the agenda for AD research and services which will positively impact the lives of the patients and caregivers that all of us serve. We would also like to thank you for including Psychology in your revised document, given the role that many psychologists play in service to AD patients and caregivers via research, education, and direct services. While neuropsychologists and psychologists share many things in common, neuropsychologists are more specialized in their knowledge of brain-behavior relationships, neuroanatomy, biological bases of cognition and behavior, standardized neurocognitive assessment, and management of neurodegenerative diseases (such as AD). Neuropsychologists frequently consult with their clinical/counseling psychologist colleagues and provide additional highly specialized diagnostic and intervention planning services for the benefit of AD patients and their caregivers. Below we will provide information regarding the critical role that neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment plays in AD diagnosis, treatment, education, and research, specifically with regard to linking biomarkers to neurobehavioral phenotypes and clinical presentation. Currently neuropsychology and neurocognitive assessment are not acknowledged in the draft HHS plan. We hope to persuade you to redress this omission.</p>
<p>We want to highlight that neuropsychologists already play an active and instrumental role in AD research (e.g., via understanding the neurocognitive and behavioral profile of the disease, determining early clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, and providing the neurocognitive clinical correlates needed for biomarker research). Neuropsychology also plays a key role in education (e.g., to other medical professionals, to patients and caregivers) and direct care of AD patients and their caregivers (e.g., innovative quality of life programs). Your acknowledgement of neuropsychology's role in the future direction of care and research in AD will help to perpetuate neuropsychology's involvement in research and innovative service programs of importance to the Alzheimer's community. Conversely, exclusion of neuropsychologists from the Draft HHS Plan may limit opportunities for neuropsychologists to remain active in AD research, education, and clinical service, and this could seriously disadvantage AD patients and caregivers who are amidst the AD experience.</p>
<p>Specifically, we seek to have neuropsychology included in (1) <strong>Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong>, which stresses the importance of the use of biological markers in the diagnosis of AD. Currently, this section of the document fails to recognize the importance of neuropsychological/neurocognitive markers of the AD phenotype that are currently the gold standard for determining the presence and progression of AD. Additionally, (2) inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct service providers (Strategy 2.A., below) is also critical to AD patients and caregivers needing this help.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>Regarding Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression, we offer the following wording suggestions for your consideration (italics ours):</p>
<p>Under Strategy 1.C: "Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids <em><strong>in relation to neuropsychological manifestations</strong></em> have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, ..."</p>
<p>and/or</p>
<p>Action 1.C.1: "Identify imaging and biomarkers <strong><em>in relation to sensitive neuropsychological measures</em></strong> to monitor disease progression."</p>
<p>In support of these suggestions we offer the following information and references:</p>
<p>Neurocognitive decline is the hallmark of AD, and according to the NIH neurocognitive assessment is essential to the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, along with clinical history (symptoms and their course), medical tests (such as blood work), and neuroimaging (<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). Also, While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for AD has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data,<sup>1,2</sup> which are hallmarks of neuropsychological evaluation at very sensitive and detailed levels.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup> Further, neuropsychologists are listed by the NIH along with Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists, and Neurologists, as specialists in assessment who can provide detailed diagnosis of AD(<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). In fact, clinical neuropsychologists often field referrals from the other three specialties mentioned by the NIH to provide very detailed assessments to assist in their patient evaluations, and often refer to the other specialists for the benefit of AD patients.</p>
<p>Neuropsychology has significantly advanced the research exploring biological markers of Alzheimer disease through the development of very sensitive neurocognitive tests; tests that are critical to early identification of neurocognitive decline (complementing Strategy 1:C of the HHS draft document).<sup>5</sup> In fact, it is not uncommon for a detailed neuropsychological evaluation to detect progressive neurocognitive decline before pathology is observed on neuroimaging such as brain MRI. Such work has assisted countless AD patients and their caregivers to enhance what time they have left, and is now being effectively used by physicians to initiate and monitor the effects of dementia delaying medications (such as cholinesterase inhibitors).</p>
<p>In the final analysis, however, there is still much that needs to be learned of the relationship between AD biomarkers and neurocognitive/functional (neuropsychological) symptoms and outcomes. As Jeffrey Cummings, M.D., noted expert on dementing conditions, has written:</p>
<p><em>The predictive relationship between biomarker changes and clinical outcomes is critical to their successful utilization in AD drug development programs. This is not known for any AD-related biomarker. Preliminary correlations have been established for some clinical outcomes and some biomarkers; it is unknown if changes in a biomarker (such as reduced MRI ventricular enlargement with treatment) will correlate with reduced decline in cognition or function following treatment (p.1482).<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p>Dr. Cummings' insightful comments lead to at least three conclusions based on the totality of biomarker research to date. First, more work needs to be done, including continued development of very sensitive standardized neuropsychological measures in relation to biomarkers for earlier identification of AD (as a clinical syndrome). Second, while there may be a correlation between biomarkers and clinical manifestations, the correlation is not perfect. Consequently, AD remains a clinical diagnosis at present, and the measurement of neurocognitive decline or enhancement (based on biological intervention) still requires detailed standardized neuropsychological assessment results (i.e., standardized and objective clinical correlates) to help press forward in biomarker research and to benefit AD sufferers. Third, neuropsychological measures are needed within the research itself as the best current means of characterizing the disease for which biomarkers are sought (i.e., neuropsychological markers remain the gold standard for biomarker research).</p>
<p><strong>2. Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct care providers: While clinical neuropsychology and clinical psychology are related, and often work together in a complementary manner in the community for the benefit of AD patients and caregivers, they are not the same specialty. Consequently, we suggest that you consider including "neuropsychologists" (along with "psychologists") as distinct additional providers within "The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease..." (Strategy 2.A.), and also in receiving HHS information regarding "...dementia curricula and practice recommendations..." (Action 2.A.3).</p>
<p>In closing, NAN again applauds your efforts to aggressively address AD, and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this endeavor. Thank you for your time in reviewing our comments. Please direct any comments, questions, or concerns to us via the NAN central office.</p>

					March 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment. The document represents an excellent start. Never the less, improvements can be made.</p>
<p>p.3 - Alzheimer's Disease: There is growing evidence that traumatic or incremental brain injuries can lead to dementia later in life. Perhaps this should this be included as a dementia.</p>
<p>p.12 - .E.3 Educate the public ... Here and elsewhere the word "educate" could be interpreted by by some as having a condescending and/or coercive effect. "Inform" or "Provide educational materials" might be better alternatives.</p>
<p>p.13 - Goal 2: Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings; it is often a transition from home care to nursing home.</p>
<p>p.13 - Strategy 2.A: "Unique challenges" are also faced by family caregivers. There is a separate section for caregivers but it deserves to be mentioned in many places.</p>
<p>p.18 - Strategy 2.F: Families also experience difficulty when the AD patient is transferred between care settings and systems.</p>
<p>p.22 - Strategy 3.A: "Caregivers report that they feel unprepared for some of the challenges of caring for ..." is a <strong>drastic</strong> understatement. Overwhelmed is more likely.</p>
<p>p.23 - Strategy 3.B: The availability of affordable facilities, such as adult day services, is vitally important to family caregivers health and well-being.</p>
<p>p.25 - Strategy 3.C.1: Long term care awareness: Issues of cost, hope, complexity, drastic interventions are all reasons for lack of planning for long term care needs.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Alliance for Aging Research, we thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Alliance for Aging Research, <a href="http://www.agingresearch.org">http://www.agingresearch.org</a>, is a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace of medical discoveries to improve the universal experience of aging and health. Our work in Alzheimer's disease includes chairing the Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition that brings together stakeholders to accelerate development of new treatments; and as an active member of the Leaders Engaged in Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) coalition, serving as co-chair of its research and drug development workgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You and Introduction </strong></p>
<p>We would like to first thank and praise the Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its swift implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In only 14 months since President Obama signed the legislation into law, HHS has appointed the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, convened the council three times, and developed both a draft framework and draft national plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, we would like to thank you for the Obama Administration's commitment of a $50 million boost in immediate funding for Alzheimer's disease research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 and for the $80 million increase in the President's fiscal 2013 budget. The announcement about the availability of these funds marks a historic moment for the country. No previous administration has proposed a research increase specific to this dreaded disease. In addition, the initiative also includes a much-needed increase of $26 million for FY 2013 to enhance support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers as well as education for providers and the general public.</p>
<p>We praise HHS for recognizing the importance of the larger demographic shift in the U.S. aging population as a motivator for success of the National Plan, which states:</p>
<p><em>NAPA offers a historic opportunity to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given the great demographic shifts that will occur over the next 30 years, including the doubling of the population of older adults, the success of this effort is of great importance to people with AD and their family members, public policy makers, and health and social service providers. </em></p>
<p>The Alliance believes that increased investment in preventing, treating or curing chronic diseases of the aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, is perhaps the single most effective strategy in reducing national spending on healthcare. As you are aware, eighty percent of seniors have at least one major chronic condition and half have two or more. Chronic diseases associated with aging account for more than 75 percent of Medicare and other federal health expenditures. Unprecedented increases in age-related diseases as the population ages are one reason the Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on healthcare will rise to 25 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025 from 17 percent today. Simply put, our nation does not have the luxury of time to address the health research needs of this population.</p>
<p>The Alliance recognizes that fiscal restraints are required in the current economic climate, and that the Administration has already extended itself to support Alzheimer's disease funding in the National Plan. However, one of our overall comments is that <strong>funding lines must be developed and additional resources provided to adequately meet the goals of an otherwise ambitious plan</strong>. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) specifically, and NIH in general, will need a funding commitment in the billion dollar range to meet the defined 2025 goal to "prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease"; FDA will need an increase of hundreds of millions to accelerate the regulatory process and promote innovation in the development of Alzheimer's disease treatments; and other agencies from AoA to CMS and HRSA will need additional resources to meet Alzheimer's-specific objectives identified in the plan that are expected to occur in conjunction with implementation of Affordable Care Act programs. The Alliance suggests that HHS create a detailed chart of current (within the next fiscal year) expected federal/private investment in each area and costs associated with meeting each goal and strategy within the plan. Otherwise, a majority of these activities look to be unfunded mandates for federal programs with already limited resources.</p>
<p>Second, the Alliance is pleased that HHS has recognized the data gaps that exist for Alzheimer's disease and has additionally committed $1.3 million for FY 2013 to address them. HHS' use of NIA-generated, peer-reviewed, figures for Alzheimer's disease prevalence is monumental. While seemingly academic, the identification and development of reliable data is the necessary starting point for accurate needs assessment and programmatic response. <strong>Data development is a cornerstone of the plan that the Alliance believes should be integrated throughout each goal as well as remain its own goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Last, the Alliance was disappointed that this draft plan did not include the inventory conducted by the federal interagency working group. It is challenging to comment on the goals and strategies of the draft plan when the rationale behind them is not included as a resource. We understand that this was the first inventory conducted and that certain federal regulations must be met before presenting it in a clear format for the public. However, we wanted to note the issue and <strong>strongly recommend that future draft plans include the inventory to allow for more informed public comment</strong>.</p>
<p>The comments below are organized by the goals and strategies identified in the plan in specific areas where we felt the Alliance had expertise and that were not already being addressed in comments submitted by the research and drug development workgroup that the Alliance co-chairs through LEAD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The Alliance praises HHS for setting a goal of 2025 to "develop effective prevention and treatment modalities." We believe that setting this goal makes sense for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NAPA legislation expires in 2025. Goal setting is valuable for mobilizing policymakers and the advocacy community, motivating researchers and industry, and galvanizing public attention and awareness of the issue. The Alliance feels strongly that HHS and NIH should be clear with the public in particular about the state of Alzheimer's disease research to manage expectations. We hope that the upcoming May Alzheimer's Research Summit will include an explanation of this goal that will be captured by the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></em></p>
<p>The Alliance is very supportive of this particular action to "examine ways to speed up the processes for bringing pharmacological treatments to market, including: identifying and validating therapeutic targets; developing new interventions: testing efficacy and safety; and regulatory approval." In fact, the Alliance spearheaded a coalition effort, Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition, <a href="http://www.act-ad.org">http://www.act-ad.org</a>, in 2006 to accomplish similar goals. <strong>HHS should consult with ACT-AD as it moves ahead with this action</strong>.</p>
<p>ACT-AD is a coalition of nearly 50 national non-profit health professional, patient, health provider and consumer organizations seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. ACT-AD's mission is to support accelerating research for transformational therapies to potentially slow, halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Until the formation of the ACT-AD Coalition, there was no point of advocacy combining the perspectives and commitment of respected advocates for women's health, consumer interests, caregiver support groups and aging interested organizations. ACT-AD is strengthened by the diversity and credibility of those voices and is bringing that strength to bear on critical issues concerning the development, review and approval of a new generation of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Under the current regulatory environment, research being performed today cannot reach patients in time to avert this disaster. CNS drugs take, on average, 13 years from initial animal studies of a drug candidate to approval. A delay of one year negatively impacts the lives of nearly 333,000 patients and their families. While these figures underscore the urgency of seeking more effective therapeutic interventions for patients with Alzheimer's disease, there are promising treatments being tested that may slow, halt or reverse Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The ACT-AD Coalition works with urgency to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The methods the Coalition uses to conduct its important work include:</p>
<ul><li>Educating healthcare professionals, providers and other key constituencies about ways to focus the attention of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials and other decision makers about the need to expedite Alzheimer's disease treatments in the crowded landscape of those vying for consideration and action.</li>
<li>Advancing ACT-AD's profile with the Food and Drug Administration officials and other key influencers and audiences as an organization that has critical mass and strategic focus to sustain a long-term commitment to improving the regulatory review of Alzheimer's disease drugs.</li>
<li>Initiating efforts to build support for FDA reform among key Congressional leaders who influence appropriations necessary for Agency reform.</li>
<li>Developing needed research and link Alzheimer's disease expertise to the Food and Drug Administration in order to support their efforts to prioritize drug review with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary base of facts.</li>
<li>Mobilizing support and pressure upon the Food and Drug Administration from outside the agency, especially through ACT-AD member organizations and collaborations with other third-party organizations.</li>
<li>Engaging the caregiver population that continues to be overburdened and unfocused on the need for political and regulatory reform.</li>
</ul><p>The ACT-AD Coalition holds periodic meetings with its members and representatives of the Food and Drug Administration. Scientific workshop topics have included clinical meaningfulness and Phase II trial issues--and the focus is always on areas relating to an open dialogue between the Food and Drug Administration and Alzheimer's disease community to advance efforts to combat the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>Our nation faces an impending healthcare crisis as the number of older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other complex health needs increasingly outpaces the number of healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to adequately care for them. If current workforce trends do not change, we will continue to fail to ensure that every older American is able to receive high-quality care. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) April 2008 report, "Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce," calls for immediate investments in enhancing the geriatric competencies of the entire workforce, increasing the recruitment and retention of geriatric specialists and caregivers, and improving the way that care for older adults is delivered.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>First, direct-care workers provide critical support to older adults in need of long-term care, providing eight out of every ten hours of paid service delivered.<sup>2</sup> This field, which is increasing at three times the rate of other jobs within the United States economy, provides the best opportunity for caring individuals to obtain vital employment positions.<sup>3</sup> There is also a significant shortage of health professionals and direct-care workers with specialized training in geriatrics and an even greater shortage of the geriatrics faculty needed to train the entire workforce. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions programs are the <strong>only</strong> federal programs that increase the number of faculty with geriatrics expertise in a variety of disciplines and offer critically important geriatrics training to the entire healthcare workforce. Title VIII Geriatrics Nursing Workforce Development Programs are the primary source of federal funding for advanced education nursing, workforce diversity, nursing faculty loan programs, nurse education, practice and retention, comprehensive geriatric education, loan repayment, and scholarship.</p>
<p>The $6 million investment by the Administration for "provider education and outreach" will barely scratch the surface in addressing shortages in geriatric workforce and training outlined in actions under Strategy 2.A. <strong>Much more substantial investment is needed to fund the recommendations by IOM and we suggest that HHS revisit that report and the three others that came before it</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if more students enter geriatrics training, incentivizing them to stay will require loan forgiveness options. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S. 1095, the "Caring for an Aging America Act" that <strong>would amend the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) requirements to add geriatrics and gerontology to the permanent eligibility</strong>. This small change in the language governing eligibility for NHSC loans would mean that geriatrics and gerontology specialists would always be eligible for NHSC loans as opposed to the current situation which is that these geriatrics and gerontology specialists can only participate in the program if the HHS Secretary so designates it. An additional advantage is that <strong>the loan forgiveness would be fully funded through the NHSC</strong>.</p>
<p>By 2030, our nation will require 3.5 million additional healthcare professionals and direct-care workers to fulfill the growing demand for care. <strong>The National Health Care Workforce Commission, established by the Affordable Care Act, will play a central role in formulating a national strategy for bolstering the healthcare workforce in order to meet the needs of the escalating number of older Americans</strong>. There is no mention of the commission in Strategy 2A.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services </strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the use of warning signs to promote early detection by providers and patients may create confusion in the public. Warning signs for Alzheimer's disease have not been validated and are not promoted as screening instruments; however, concern has been raised that individuals experiencing cognitive deficits and their families may treat warning sign lists as a screening tool.<sup>4</sup><strong>Although warning signs are publicized by several national organizations for educational purposes, they are not a substitute for a structured screening or consultation with a primary care provider</strong>. Further, the utility of these warning signs is questionable since the individuals in whom these problems are first noticed are frequently well into a dementia course. In addition:</p>
<ul><li>Most of the warning signs may be indicative of a number of other health issues, including everything from depression (changes in mood/personality) to transient ischemic attack (problems with language/disorientation). There is often no mention that these warning signs may indicate other conditions.</li>
<li>By the time any one or more of the warning signs presents the individual may be in the early moderate/moderate stage at best so "early detection" is a misnomer.</li>
<li>Warning signs may be useful in raising public awareness about Alzheimer's disease. However, elevating warning signs to an early detection tool and then placing the onus of recognition on those with the illness and their loved ones is not sound policy--especially given that anosognosia (unawareness of a problem of cognition in oneself, usually to the point of vigorously denying the problem) is a common symptom for individuals with the disease.</li>
<li>Moreover, promoting the use of warning signs among individuals and family caregivers may serve as a disincentive to providers to learn more about proper, proactive detection methods.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes </strong></p>
<p>Behavioral issues are a main reason that psychoactive medications are administered in long-term care settings, which may result in increased falls, increased mortality and increased confusion. There has been increased focus on the use of "atypical" antipsychotic medications in particular, after FDA introduced its black box warning in 2005 and for "conventional" antipsychotics in 2008 for patients with dementia.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In May 2011 the HHS Office of the Inspector General released a report Medicare Atypical Antipsychotic Drug Claims for Elderly Nursing Home Residents," which found that over a six month period from January-June 2007, 51 percent of Medicare claims for atypical antipsychotic drugs were erroneous, amounting to $116 million.<sup>6</sup> The report found that over 726,000 of the 1.4 million atypical antipsychotic drug claims for elderly nursing home residents did not comply with Medicare reimbursement criteria. The claimed drugs were either not used for medically accepted indications as supported by the compendia or not documented as having been administered to the elderly nursing home residents. The OIG report concludes "We suggest that CMS either use its existing authority or seek new statutory authority to <em>prevent payment</em> [emphasis added] and hold nursing homes responsible for submitting claims for drugs that are not administered according to CMS's standards regarding unnecessary drug use in nursing homes."</p>
<p>The two main reasons for overuse of antipsychotics in nursing home residents with dementia are 1) understaffing and 2) lack of training. Required staff ratios have been suggested for years by nursing home advocates but Congress is reluctant to touch the issue. Training was somewhat addressed in the Affordable Care Act as part of the Nursing Home Transparency provisions, but the training section only applies to nursing assistants--not supervisors. <strong>Dementia training for nursing home staff should apply to nursing supervisors as well as assistants</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes the issue even more complicated is that there is valid use for antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. A September 2011 report, a comparative effectiveness review prepared for AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program by the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center, based at the RAND Corporation, found statistically significant evidence for risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, for the off-label indications of dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>There are provisions in the Nursing Home Reform Law, enacted in 1987, that clearly define appropriate use of psychoactive drugs, circumstances when antipsychotic drugs should be limited and provides for review of a patients drug regimen. CMS guidance to surveyors in the State Operations Manual8also encourages facilities to use non-pharmacological alternatives, identifies situations where antipsychotic medications are not indicated,9 and provides an investigative protocol for unnecessary drugs, including antipsychotic drugs. Despite these strong provisions antipsychotic drug use remains a serious concern, in part because the law, regulations, and surveyor guidance are inadequately and ineffectively enforced. <strong>Stronger enforcement of these standards would make an enormous difference</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>As HHS considers ways to strengthen its National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, the Alliance looks forward to working with you. Thank you for considering our views, and please do not hesitate to contact Alliance for Aging Research Director of Public Policy Cynthia Bens if you have any questions or would like additional information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Input on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>GE Healthcare appreciates this opportunity to provide input and comments on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Our comments focus on the use of diagnostics to help physicians diagnose and treat disease and to reduce the burden of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias on patients and their caregivers.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare, a division of the General Electric Company, has decades of expertise in medical imaging and information technologies, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, performance improvement, drug discovery, and biopharmaceuticals manufacturing technologies. GE Healthcare's broad range of products and services enables healthcare providers to offer patients earlier and better diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart disease, neurological diseases, and other conditions that threaten the quality and length of life. Worldwide, GE Healthcare employs more than 53,000 people committed to serving healthcare professionals and their patients in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Comments</strong></p>
<p>Our comments and recommendations focus on the following issues:</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis, Monitor, Treatment and Prevention</strong>: The magnitude of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the US is overwhelming; Alzheimer's disease affects 1 in every 8 older Americans and nearly half of those ages 85 and older. As the number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias grows in the future, aggregate payments for their care will increase dramatically from $183 billion in 2011 to an estimated staggering $1.1 trillion by 2050.</p>
<p>While an estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, the Alzheimer's Association reports that half of them lack a specific diagnosis. This represents a fundamental gap that is identified in the Draft National Plan. To address this gap, the Plan calls for increased efforts to identify disease, diagnose AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p>New diagnostic technologies suggest benefits in early screening and utility in determining treatment pathways. Specific diagnostic tests including brain imaging may aid practitioners and caregivers to implement care plans early in the disease process.</p>
<p>For treatment decisions, new diagnostic imaging technologies may help inform and guide healthcare providers when making decisions ranging from pharmacologic choices to duration of therapy. In addition, technological advancements in diagnostics using brain imaging may serve useful in drug development as they allow researchers to stratify patient populations according to the extent and anatomic distribution of pathophysiology and then to measure the effect of tehapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>For non-medical purposes, diagnostic tests offer patients and caregivers information that may enable the initiation of preventive measures like exercise (both cognitive and physical), time to make life planning decisions and understanding of the course of the disease.</p>
<p>Because AD progresses in the brain for as long as a decade before classic signs and symptoms become clear to diagnosticians, early detection of the pathophysiology is crucial to effective intervention and better health for those affected.</p>
<p><strong>GE Healthcare's Effort To Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD)</strong>: For decades, GE Healthcare has invested heavily in R&amp;D to bring to market an increasing number of molecular medical diagnostic products; companies like GE Healthcare translate scientific and medical discoveries into innovative products and services that add objectivity to clinical trials and every day practice of medicine to help physicians prescribe the right drug at a dose which is right for their patients.</p>
<p>By example, these advances have begun to change the paradigm for treatment of diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Access To New Technologies</strong>: While predictive testing and risk assessment have evolved rapidly over the past decade, the adoption of new diagnostic imaging procedures comes with challenges. GE Healthcare is pleased that cognitive testing has been added to the routine physical exam in Medicare as a screening tool. Nevertheless, the benefits of new brain imaging or molecular imaging diagnostic tests have not been widely recognized by payers that see limited value in early diagnosis when treatment choices are limited. We support the many action items included in the draft plan that will accelerate the development and adoption of important diagnostic imaging tools.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: We encourage the inclusion of action items in the Plan that stress the need for Medicare to provide access to the health benefits of diagnostic imaging technologies, as well as other innovative technologies while under a doctor's care within the practice of medicine.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare also supports the draft Plan's focus on accelerating research aimed at preventing, diagnosing and treating this debilitating disease, and strengthening care quality and efficiency of care both before and after new treatments become available. Patients and their caregivers deserve no less.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare very much appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on these important issues and looks forward to HHS and the Advisory Council's final recommendations in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. If you have any questions on our comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit written comments for the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as part of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, our aging network formed an interagency workgroup to discuss the draft and make recommendations. The following agencies and their representatives were asked for their input:</p>
<p>Aging Services Division (ASD) Division Director<br />
					ASD Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) Project Director<br />
					ASD Policy and Strategic Planning Supervisor<br />
					Oklahoma Health Care Authority representative (the state Medicaid agency)<br />
					ASD Home and Community-Based Services Program Administrator<br />
					Adult Protective Services Program Administrator<br />
					OKDHS Developmental Disabilities Division Director<br />
					ASD Older Americans Act Program Administrator<br />
					Oklahoma Mental Health Advocacy Coalition Director<br />
					ASD Legal Services Developer<br />
					ASD State Long Term Care Ombudsman</p>
<p>Many of these individuals also served on Oklahoma's task force to study and make recommendations regarding the effect of Alzheimer's Disease in our state. This task force, co-chaired by Senator Tom Ivester and Representative David Dank, met over a year and filed a final report which can be found here: <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/publications/issue_papers/health_social_services/effect_of_alzheimers_task_force_final_report.pdf">http://www.oksenate.gov/publications/issue_papers/health_social_services/effect_of_alzheimers_task_force_final_report.pdf</a></p>
<p>Our group focused on Goals 2, 3, and 4 of the national draft plan.</p>
<p>General Thoughts:</p>
<p>Our group felt inclusion of the existing aging network is necessary for the success of the national plan. The aging network, through the above listed agencies and programs, already works with family caregivers, documents existing service gaps, and disseminates information statewide. Our statewide ADRC program already works to help families and caregivers to meet current needs and plan for future ones. Our Older Americans Act services specially target those individuals and their families who are facing an Alzheimer's diagnosis through the National Family Caregiver Support Program. Including the aging network would help to optimize existing resources and coordinate implementation of the plan's objectives. Our overarching concern is the aging network and its involvement in the rollout of this plan.</p>
<p>Specific Comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The draft plan references a Research Summit in May 2012 (pg. 7). We were curious if that has been scheduled, who will be participating, what will come out of that summit that could be used and in what way, etc. Likewise, the Federal Interagency Working Group referenced in the plan could be heavily leveraged to support change needed at the state level. Have the members of that group been chosen? What are differences between that group and the to-be-assembled leadership team referenced on pg. 29?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really liked the references in both plans for 1) veterans 2) private sector. The private sector piece has limitless opportunity. Finally, we think for anything meaningful to happen -- either at the national or state level -- you must see legislative involvement and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Oklahoma we have recognized the importance of providing case management to inform and coordinate services available to caregivers and their families and would like to see it as a cornerstone of services under this plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oklahoma's Aging Services Division works with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and would like to see the unique needs of older prisoners addressed: (1) For those who are incarcerated, we would like to see specialized training in dementia information for prison personnel and comparative treatment options and (2) For those who have been released, more "safety net" provisions since these individuals are less likely to have a family/friend support network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would like the plan to include the following action items under a new Strategy 3.F:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.F</strong>. Provide leadership in understanding legal issues, including legal opportunities and obstacles faced by persons with Alzheimer's Disease, their family members and caregivers. Legal issues of persons with Alzheimer's Disease emerge as the progression of the disease continues. Prompt and early legal intervention, prior to the onset of incapacity, can relieve stress on family members and caregivers who must deal with the consequences of lack of legal planning as capacity continues to diminish. AOA's Legal Services Developers in each state address the development of local legal services and ensure that education is available to inform persons with Alzheimer's Disease, their family members and caregivers about legal options.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3F.1</strong>. Provide information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues during life of the person with Alzheimer's Disease as capacity diminishes. HHS will prioritize the dissemination of legal information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues during life of the person with Alzheimer's Disease. HHS will encourage state and local entities to work with local attorneys and legal providers to offer information related to the issues of capacity for decision making along the continuum of the progression of the disease; the uses and abuses of powers of attorney for finances and health care; the execution of advance directives, including living wills, do not resuscitate consent forms and the appointment of health care proxies; the process of legal guardianship that enables caregivers or family members to make decisions regarding the care of the person and/or the finances of the person Alzheimer's disease, and the appropriate use of "least restrictive" means to preserve the dignity of the person with Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.F.2</strong>. Provide information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues upon the death of the person with Alzheimer's Disease. HHS also recognizes that the need for quality information regarding legal issues upon the death of the person with Alzheimer's Disease is paramount. HHS will work with states to engage local attorneys and legal providers in providing information related to estate planning documents and techniques including the execution of a will and the process of probate that addresses the need to name an executor and beneficiaries; estate planning techniques that may be available in states to avoid probate including living trusts; transfer on death and payable on death documents and deeds; and the use and abuse of joint tenancy as an estate planning tool with finances and real property.</p>

<p>I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the March 14 Advisory Council teleconference as well as the opportunity to submit my comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and its importance for the more than 400,000 individuals with Down syndrome in the US and their families and caregivers as well as associated stakeholders. More explicit inclusion of Down syndrome as integral to the Plan, particular concerning fundamental, translational and clinical research, will be important for accelerating progress and success not only for individuals with Down syndrome, and associated very high Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and dementia, but also for the entire population that will develop or currently have Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Regarding Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					March, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the development of the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and for the opportunity to submit comments.</p>
<p>The Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation is a national/international 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission to stimulate and support biomedical research that will accelerate development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for children <strong>and</strong> adults with <strong>Down syndrome</strong>. The major objectives include creating new opportunities for <strong>all</strong> Individuals with Down Syndrome to: 1) Lead more independent lives; 2) Participate more successfully in schools &amp; employment; and 3) Prevent additional early cognitive decline with aging &amp; <strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Since its founding in 2004, DSRTF, through its novel research strategy and grants program, has identified and substantively supported much of the research that has led to the recent rapid and unprecedented advances in Down syndrome cognition research and the first clinical trial with a novel drug candidate to focus on as a primary indication and specifically address overcoming cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with Down syndrome by a major international pharmaceutical company, Roche.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the explicit recognition, inclusion and designation of attention to intellectual disabilities populations as unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease within Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease and for populations facing care challenges. However, this is far too limited within the overall plan; it is more than just initiatives addressing only care. As discussed further below, there is a very strong rationale to <strong>explicitly include Down syndrome</strong> in each of the strategies, and designated strategic sub-actions, comprising the National Alzheimer's Plan and resulting initiatives, and Strategy 1 involving fundamental, translational and clinical research in particular.</p>
<p>As research has documented, virtually all individuals with Down syndrome, now numbering more than 400,000 individuals in the US, develop the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40. Research has also shown that, very conservatively, at least 25% increasing to 75% or more of the individuals with Down syndrome between the ages of 40-60 develop the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and the percentage increases with age. These facts underscore the very significant and important relevance of this population as a key and explicit element to be included not only in the National Alzheimer's Plan but also in the development and implementation of all aspects of the Plan, including research (fundamental, translational, and clinical) to effectively prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease, enhancing care quality and delivery, and expanding supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given these facts, explicit and integral inclusion and consideration of Down syndrome in the Plan and associated initiatives can not only significantly address the significant number of individuals with Down syndrome but also the larger non-Down syndrome population developing or with Alzheimer's disease. This requires significant increases in awareness and rational considerations among researchers and clinicians, which can be partly addressed through explicitly including Down syndrome more prominently in the Plan as well as in resulting initiatives and increased proportional funding.</p>
<p>Given the significant size of the Down syndrome population (&gt;400,000 in the US, and up to 10-times that number worldwide) and the virtual certainty that the individuals will develop the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and ultimately the associated dementia further compromising their cognition and life, inclusion of Down syndrome, particularly in the research initiatives (fundamental, translational, and clinical) would significantly contribute important novelty, unavailable otherwise, to as well as enhance and accelerate essentially all aspects of the major objectives specified under Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 as well as Goal 2. NIH grants and funding for <strong>all</strong> of Down syndrome research have remained disproportionately very low, e.g. $20M in FY 2011. This includes a much smaller and too limited subset of research grants investigating the aspects of Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. As only one contrasting example, explicit and significant attention and funding by NIH and its Alzheimer's disease research initiatives, both basic and translational, have been targeted to so-called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, both basic and translational (see e.g., the DIAN initiative) that is much more rare and with a much smaller population. In both Down syndrome and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease myriad research has confirmed the significant involvement of the same gene, APP, and its products (The APP gene is located on human chromosome 21, the chromosome trisomic in Down syndrome, as are a number of additional genes demonstrated to be involved in mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease.). Through more detailed and sufficient investigations in the Down syndrome population, researchers can obtain invaluable insight into how and why Alzheimer's disease develops, and can compare and extend their findings to the much more common late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease as well as enhance and accelerate development of new therapeutics. The relevant trajectory to Alzheimer's disease and size of the Down syndrome population provides a strong rationale for greater recognition and explicit inclusion in the National Alzheimer's Disease Plan and resulting Alzheimer's disease fundamental, translational and clinical research initiatives.</p>
<p>Although by no means an attempt to thoroughly include detailed or exhaustive rationale and recommendations in these comments here, in addition to the suggestions and requests above with respect to more prominent and explicit integral recognition and inclusion of Down syndrome in the ultimate version of the National Alzheimer's plan, I submit the following recommendations for further consideration:</p>
<ul><li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Goal 1 as well as each of the proposed "Actions" under Strategy 1A, including Actions 1.A.1-5.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.B. including Actions 1.B.1-6. This would include not only research in animal models of Down syndrome, but with respect to human clinical studies explicit designation and inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to those clinical studies initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts. The results would be expected to be mutually informative and beneficial.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.C. including Actions 1.C.1-2. Again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success.</li>
<li>As is true for Alzheimer's disease research and development, relevant Down syndrome research is ongoing, and increasing, internationally. It will be important to coordinate with and expand relevant Down syndrome research internationally and collaboratively. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.D. including Actions 1.D.1-2.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.E. including Actions 1.E.1-3. With respect to Action 1.E.1., again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success. With respect to Action 1.E.2., inclusion of private-public collaborations and partnerships between Federal entities such as NIH and non-governmental nonprofit organizations such as DSRTF with its focus on Down syndrome cognition research will enhance productivity, accelerate significant progress and success as well as minimize duplications of efforts and resources. With respect to Action 1.E.3., the critical importance of the increasing development and very significant impact of Alzheimer's disease on individual with Down syndrome and their families and care givers underscores the importance of involvement and communication with this community and associated stakeholders.</li>
<li>As indicated above, given the particular and significant relevance and importance of and impact of Alzheimer's disease on the relatively large population of individuals with Down syndrome, their families and caregivers as well as the healthcare system, it is not sufficient to generally designate "intellectual disabilities" in only Strategy 2.H. "Down syndrome" should be explicitly included in proposed Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies.</li>
<li>Finally, based on the comments, rationale and recommendations outlined above, we would encourage and recommend that a representative from the Down syndrome community be added to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Advisory Council, as the important deliberations, priorities and implementation will have mutual benefits to science/research, clinical care, and long term care not just additionally for individuals with Down syndrome and associated Alzheimer's disease but also for the broader population and research efforts involving Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>I would be very pleased to further discuss, as may be helpful and informative, any aspects of the above concerning the importance of explicit inclusion and considerations of Down syndrome relating to Alzheimer's disease in further detail with those involved in developing the National Plan, including members of the Advisory Committee. I have registered for and plan to attend the upcoming May 14-15 NAPA/NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in Bethesda, and look forward to the opportunity for further discussion of the importance and relevance of Down syndrome for the Plan and its successful implementation as outlined above.</p>

<p><strong>We are writing to commend you and the Department of Health and Human Services for including care transitions in the National Alzheimer's Project Act's (NAPA's) draft <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. </strong></p>
<p>At Healthcentric Advisors, Rhode Island's Medicare Quality Improvement Organization (QIO), we are currently in our 4th year working with local providers and stakeholders to improve the safety of patient care transitions. Our Medicarefunded Safe Transitions Project aims to implement sustainable systems change that improves patients' experiences and outcomes as they transition between care settings. In 2011, we published the results of a patient coaching intervention that we implemented in six Rhode Island hospitals, which reduced the odds of 30-day hospital readmission 34% among coached patients vs. those who were eligible, but not approached for coaching (Voss et al., <em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em>).</p>
<p>Regrettably, there is little evidence or expert consensus about how to include patients with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, in interventions to improve transition quality. Our project's multi-stakeholder Advisory Board includes consumers, providers and payors from a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings, including Rhode Island's free-standing psychiatric hospital, and has recently begun discussion of ways to target and tailor post-hospital coaching and other interventions to these patients and/or their caregivers. <strong>We believe that NAPA's inclusion of care transitions in the draft <em>National Plan</em> will inform efforts across the country, helping us collectively provide better care for these vulnerable patients</strong>.</p>
<p>Our next Advisory Board meeting, scheduled for Thursday, April 5, 2012, includes discussion of the draft National Plan. We plan to follow-up with you later that week to share the results of our group's discussion, in hopes that additional input will be helpful as you and your colleagues continue to refine your draft.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, I am writing in support of the proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders (ADRD) that would promote an earlier diagnosis of the disease, improve strategies for long term services and supports, and accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging was created by the State Legislature in 1973 for the purpose of improving the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the single State agency authorized to receive and dispense Federal Older Americans Act funds and is mandated to provide a comprehensive coordinated service system for the State's 2.2 million older persons, giving high priority to those in greatest need. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network, caregivers and persons with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, an estimated 222,300 individuals in Illinois are living with Alzhiemer's disease with a direct and indirect financial toll of $5.2 billion. More than 70% of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease are living at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to assist care recipients with Activities of Dailiy Living (ADLs) than caregivers to other persons.<sup>(1)</sup> Caregivers often help to manage other serious medical conditions in addition to Alzheimer's, and because Alzheimer's and other dementia usually progress slowly, most caregivers spend many years in the caregiving role.<sup>(2)</sup> In 2006 the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Family Caregiver Association reported an estimated 1.2 million family caregivers in Illinois were providing 1.3 million hours of care to family members. As the baby boom generation enters the age of greatest risk for Alzheimer's, by 2025 their number in Illinois is expected to increase to over 239,000.</p>
<p>Thirteen Area Agencies on Aging and statewide service providers comprise the Aging Network in Illinois, which effectively links older persons with needed services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP), implemented through the Aging Nework, provides five basic service categories to family caregivers including: information about services; assistance in accessing services; counseling; support groups and trianing/education; respite care; and, supplemental services.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, 66,132 Illinoisans received assistance through services of the NFCSP. Additionally, 493,313 individuals received assistance through supportive and nutrition services of the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>The proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders contains thoughtful recommendations which address the immediate and long-term needs of caregivers, providers and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Aging Network in Illinois is committed to providing services to Alzheimer patients, their families and caregivers through a number of programs which support the five goals of the National Plan.</p>
<ul><li>Public Education and Outreach: Through Title III-B efforts under the Older Americans Act and Title III-E programs of the National Family Caregiver Support Program the Aging Network provided education and outreach on aging issues and available resources to 6,429 individuals in FY 2011. Additionally, the Department collaborates with many professional organizations to provide education and training opportunities. Examples include the Annual Elder Rights Conference; Senior Expos; Area Agencies on Aging sponsored Lunch and Learn/Brown Bag events; Caregiver Conferences; AIRS (Alliance of Information and Referral Systems) training; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Older Caregiver Training.</li>
<li>Outreach to healthcare providers: Home and community-based resources are critical to ensure that persons living with Alzheimer's disease are adequately and safely cared for in their homes as long as possible and contain the cost of health care. The Illinois Department on Aging sponsors many conferences and workshops for professionals including the Community Care Program/Case Coordination Unit Annual Supervisor Conference convening supervisors from case coordination units and home care agencies; the Annual Governor's Conference on Aging and Illinois TRAID comprised of state and local law enforcement agencies and other professional organizations. The Department also promotes the use of the Administration on Aging's National Alzheimer's Call Center by caregivers and encourages referrals by AAAs and providers.</li>
<li>Expanded support for people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers in the community: The Department has aggressively pursued funding to expand and enhance services for caregivers. In 2009 the Administration on Aging awarded the Department a three year Lifespan Respite grant which has enhanced access to and improved awareness of respite services. The Department has established a statewide Caregiver Advisory Committee which convenes regularly to discuss caregiver issues, share resources and best practices and review caregiver programs and is establishing protocol to implement and effective service delivery system through Aging and Disability Resource Centers/Coordinated Points of Entry.</li>
<li>Improved data collection and analysis: The Department works closely with the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging to collect data for NAPIS reporting as well as reviewing current caregiver assessment tools.</li>
</ul><p>In 2009, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Related Dementia State Plan - Senate Joint Resolution 43 - Report to the Governor and General Assembly." Recommendations in this report are reflected in the National Plan and include:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing adequate staffing levels and funding</li>
<li>Establishing basic and specialized education and training for persons when responsibilities make it likely they will come into contact with persons with AD and related dementias and their caregivers</li>
<li>Facilitate planning, treatment and research</li>
<li>Provide assistance to unpaid caregivers of persons with AD</li>
<li>Determine an effective system to collect data</li>
</ul><p>We must continue to examine our current capability to meet the Alzheimer's crisis and propose action to prepare for and respond to these challenges which include the development of a standardized caregiver assessment; establishment of the ADRC service delivery model; continue collaborative efforts of the Lifespan Respite Program; continue to incorporate consumer directed care service models through the National Family Caregiver Support Program; continue to collaborate with the Alzheimer's Association in Illinois; utilize Area Agencies on Aging and service providers to disseminate information and provide culturally sensitive training and materials to providers and caregivers; assist families and individuals in planning for future needs and provide updates to families, caregivers and providers regarding the latest clinical guidelines and information on how to work with people with AD; examine the capacity of public safety and law enforcement to respond to person's with Alzheimer's; examination of trends in the Alzheimer's population and needs, including assistance to persons with early stage and early on-set Alzheimer's and persons with Alzheimer's and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging and the Aging Network is committed to continue to respond in the most appropriate and effective way to this growing health problem and meet the challenge of providing service to Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers. The proposed National Plan is sensitive to local efforts to support caregivers and direct-care workers and offers viable proposals to support, educate and train the direct-care workforce and state aging workforces.

<p>I was quite pleased to read about the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. As a geriatrician and wound care physician, the majority of my patients are in some form of this devastating illness.</p>
<p>I was dismayed, however, to see absolutely no mention of the fact that currently Alzheimer's Disease is a terminal disease. In reviewing the following statement, one must get to the root cause as to how more healthcare resources are spent on these individuals:</p>
<p>"Caring for people with Alzheimer's disease also strains the health and long-term care systems. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease use a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources; for instance, they are hospitalized 2-3 times as often as people the same age who do not have the disease.<sup>9</sup>"</p>
<p>Many family members and caregivers do not understand that the natural progression of Alzheimer's Disease results in total dependency, resulting in aspiration pneumonias because of swallowing dysfunction, urosepsis and failing to thrive - despite 1:1 care by family members or caregivers.</p>
<p>The Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife has recently published "Advanced Dementia: A Guide for Families". This guide informs family members that Alzheimer's, and other forms of dementia, are terminal and that decisions can be made to enhance the quality of life rather than the quantity.</p>
<p>Until we find a cure for Alzheimer's, it will continue to be a terminal illness. Efforts must be made to educate the masses on the progression of this disease so that appropriate choices are made in the best interest of these patients and their families.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>Caregiver support: comment/recommendations for a caregiver "proxy" for specific recurring elements/items to obtain AZ care and/or documentation of services. For example, there is a service here in Maryland (maybe all states - but I never utilized it until I moved here). For a fee (that is well worth it) the service is automobile title/tax documentation and filing. This title service obtains the necessary information from the owner of the vehicle and then completes the necessary processes at the title/courthouse to research title, complete documents and file the title.</p>
<p>Something similar could/should be offered to caregivers. They lose many hours from their own work/family/life spending hours dealing with the mandatory documentation/filing/provider visits - Insurance, Medicare, SSI, finances.</p>
<p>Improvements could be gained through informatics and digitalization of records and bioscreen/markers. Obtain information from AZ healthcare proxy/financial proxy caregivers to write a book on a step wise process of what is required by caregivers to file Medicare, SSI, etc. and suggestions on how a business "proxy" service could do this work. And/or how to automate the procedures through functionalities through a software application and with secure/encryption.</p>
<p>Home/housing models: I hear repeatedly that it is cheaper for an AZ patient to live at home (if home is available) than in an institutional setting. That is not true in the current environment. The cost of maintaining 24h/7d care in an AZ patient home is more expensive that placing the AZ patient in an institution. For example, the cost of care in Alabama, is primarily due to in-house sitter/aide - minimum $12-15/hour, is the equivalent of $264-$360/day, equivalent to up to $10,000/month. This does not include cost of housing overhead, food, medications, transportation, clothing, toiletries, taxes. The cost of AZ/dementia care in an assisted living facility is about 50% of that cost (includes housing, utilities, and food). Either cost is excessive and any personal savings are rapidly consumed and then insurance (if coverage purchased), then Medicaid pays.</p>
<p>The only way to reduce or minimize in home care is for volunteer services and/or family live in care. Churches may be a "mission" service and should consider the care/education/services for elderly adultsequivalent to the resources they invest in children services. With improvement of technology, monitoring/tracking devices, virtual monitoring, the care in house may be drastically reduced until the AZ patient is incapable of or has severe reductions in ADLs.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>While the Draft National Alzheimer's Plan mentions nonpharmacological treatments and initiatives for dementia, it does so in a way that enables these important initiatives to be easily sidelined through lack of funding, lack of understanding and inappropriate research.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that the unique and positive alternative paradigm of nonpharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's must be recognized. This paradigm has several key dimensions that the National Alzheimer's Plan must recognize as a legitimate treatment modality for Alzheimer's and related dementias that can significantly improve the lives of those with these conditions and can significantly reduce costs in the care and treatment of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>The following must be recognized and included in the plan if these significant care options are to be valued as they clearly need to be so the many millions of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias today and tomorrow receive the quality of life and human rights they deserve.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><em>A DIFFERENT PARADIGM<br />
							Nonpharmacological interventions represent a global paradigm of Alzheimer's treatment; much more than just individual actions such as chocolate, dolls, and environmental design. This paradigm, based on neuroscience theory, applied research, and clinical practice, has been developed by many experts over decades. If this powerful approach to dealing with dementia and reducing symptoms is to be taken seriously, the particulars, no matter how exceptional (such as museum programs for people with Alzheimer's, providing improvisational theatre, or giving chocolate), need to be taken as examplars of a larger way of thinking about Alzheimer's and dementia--a new paradigm--not as ends in themselves. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE<br />
							There is a huge cache of evidence-based knowledge demonstrating how non-pharmacological interventions reduce symptoms and improve daily lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. This research is often discounted and rejected because although it is meaningful and fits the needs of the evaluation being conducted, it does not fit a particular research model--the double blind randomized controlled trial. It is important to assess these data carefully to calculate the statistical effect sizes they represent and thus their impact on people's lives. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>METHODOLOGY AND METHODS<br />
							Much existing research is discounted by policymakers, researchers, and others because they are convinced that the only evidence worth counting is generated by double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs represent one important way to generate knowledge; but only one way. Other methodologies contribute substantially to our knowledge of nonpharmacological interventions and need to be taken seriously. It makes little sense to discredit a large body of knowledge that could immensely help policy and decision-making. The following summarizes two alternative ways to think about research methodology. </em></p>
<p><em>The RCT gold standard assumes that 1. It is the highest level of proof, no matter what the research question, 2. It is at the top of a hierarchy of methods where other methodologies are "lower" on the continuum, and 3. That statistical significance is a measure of meaningfulness of a finding. </em></p>
<p><em>The alternative gold standard for nonpharmacological and other research assumes that 1. The best methodology for any research question is the methodology that fits the question best--not any particular one, 2. There is no single continuum of methodology and no absolute hierarchy, and. 3. That effect measures are an important addition to statistical significance as a measure of a finding's "meaningfulness." </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
							Freedom to choose, getting what you want, being part of the larger society and taking part in cultural activities are human rights everyone deserves--including those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. We ought to be shocked at the limits to human rights being imposed daily on those with dementia (no chocolate and no visits to museums) rather than amazed that human rights are being respected in a few places--Arizona, or New York, or Massachusetts or wherever. </em></p>
<p><em>The World Health Organization defines the rights of all people as dignity, independence, self-fulfillment, participation and care. Respecting these for people living with Alzheimer's could well be a rallying cry for those who care about people living with this condition.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>THE WAY OUT OF THE ETHICAL DILEMMA OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS<br />
							In the name of science and further research, there is a movement taking place to diagnose Alzheimer's disease long before those being diagnosed show any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although these tests are presented as limited to research purposes, they are highly likely to be employed in everyday practice. For the millions who will receive this early diagnosis tomorrow and the millions living with this dementia diagnosis today, early diagnosis presents a major ethical dilemma: What to do with a diagnosis if no medications are available that stop the progress of the disease? The nonpharmacological paradigm and its associated interventions represent an ethical way to respond to the call for early Alzheimer's diagnosis since they offer a clear solution to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. </em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>For these reasons, we urge that an expert and champion of nonpharmacological approaches and treatments for dementia be appointed to generate research, direct information gathering and otherwise serve the needs of those with dementia today employing nonpharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and others administering research programs for dementia to include on an equal basis in all research, both nonpharmacological treatments and pharmacological ones. By nonpharmacological "treatments" we mean all health related activities that research has demonstrated have positive behavioral and health outcomes. These include, among others: engaging activity, exercise, targeted nutrition, music, visual arts, film, drama, museums, an appropriately designed and stimulating environment, memory books, high-touch end of life care, external written cueing, information technology, training family and formal caregivers, counseling, meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, poetry, storytelling, pets, and even chocolate.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and those administering Alzheimer's-focused research programs and Alzheimer's-focused intervention strategies to develop and make explicit key performance indicators suited to nonpharmacological interventions. We also urge them to include in research protocols all evaluation methods and methodologies suited to studying the effects of real-world applications of nonpharmacological treatments. We urge that all research involving treatment of dementia, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, include reporting the clinical significance of effects produced by treatments, as well as statistical significance.</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association (APA), I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services, the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, and the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop and refine the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Enclosed are our APA comments in response to the draft plan released on February 22, 2012. APA is a scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with 154,000 members and affiliates. APA's mission is to advance the creation, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA is eager to collaborate with the Advisory Council, federal agencies, and other organizations in the continued planning and implementation of the National Plan. We will continue to promote the involvement of our members in this important effort and stand ready to recommend psychologists (including researchers, clinicians, and educators) with expertise in a wide array of areas that are critical to the plan's success. These areas include: cognitive aging; neuropsychological and capacity assessment; evidence-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers; implementation research, public education and social marketing; palliative care; designing culturally appropriate programs and materials; health provider education and training; integrated health and care coordination models; and dementia guideline development.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments, or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of APA's Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>American Psychological Association Comments on Draft National Plan</strong></p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) appreciates that the Draft National Plan is responsive to some of the concerns that we raised in January. In particular, we are pleased to see greater attention to clinical trials to test lifestyle interventions, including exercise and cognitive training. These interventions show promise as ways to improve cognitive health, and may in time be shown to prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The second draft's emphasis on recruiting diverse participants to clinical trials is also important.</p>
<p>The ability to image biomarkers has significantly advanced the study of Alzheimer's. What continues to be missing in the current draft is an acknowledgement of the critical role of neuropsychological testing and assessment to measure changes in cognitive performance. Real clinical benefits for those with AD depend on fully understanding how biomarkers relate to cognition and behavior. It is fundamentally important to understand why people with similar amounts of beta amyloid may have very different cognitive profiles. The National Institute on Aging and its funding partners are urged to support additional research that links the presence of biomarkers with changes in cognition and functional behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1A: Identify research priorities and milestones </em></p>
<p>APA supports the convening of a summit to help set research priorities to reach the goals articulated in the National Plan, and the additional strategies to receive broad input and refine and update research goals and priorities as the Plan is put into effect. APA also supports the convening of a workshop on non-Alzheimer's dementias, and offers assistance for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>In order to clarify the types of research being discussed, APA suggests the following wording changes - with underlined text to be added and struck-through text to be deleted: </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will expand clinical trials on pharmacologic and <s>non-pharmacologic</s> <u>behavioral</u> ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: APA prefers that behavioral studies be given their own name, and that they not be defined only by whether they include a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>"Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular, cellular, <u>and cognitive</u> mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention. "</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Certainly molecular and cellular work is vitally important. However, an 'integrated interdisciplinary basic science agenda' for Alzheimer's must also include basic cognitive and behavioral research.</p>
<p><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Identifying <u>and linking</u> <s>imaging</s> biomarkers <u>and behavioral/cognitive markers</u> in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Biomarker research is tremendously important, but it is neuropsychological and cognitive measures that enable scientists to link biomarkers to observable clinical symptoms. Biomarker research advances are leading to the ability to diagnose and track AD, but findings cannot be considered complete in the absence of behavioral data. Therefore, the two areas of research should be linked in the plan's language.</p>
<p>Current research demonstrates that neuropsychological measures function well as diagnostic, prognostic, and disease progression indicators (Blacker et al., 2007; Gomar et al., 2011; Jacobs et al., 1995; Tabert et al., 2006). Cognitive measures are critical in the practical and operational (not theoretical) level within all three recognized stages of AD -- pre-clinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia -- in recently updated diagnostic guidelines by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association. Therefore, cognitive measures hold the promise of identifying people at the highest risk of developing AD up to 20 years or more before the disease is diagnosed, and are the best measures of potential impact of interventions on disease progression. Particularly as treatments are worked into preclinical phases of AD, improvements in the sensitivity of the cognitive measures to reliable change over time is critically important.</p>
<p>Recent studies in 2010 and 2011, many using ADNI data, have shown that neuropsychological measures are more accurate, earlier predictors of progression to AD when compared to MRI, FDG-PET, and amyloid imaging (Gomar et al., 2011). There is considerable promise in broadening and improving the measurement of cognitive markers of AD. Every piece of the expansion and improvement of AD research will require good (and better) cognitive assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </em></p>
<p>"The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease includes healthcare and long-term services and supports providers such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, <u>neuropsychologists</u>, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants, who provide care at home or in long-term care facilities. These providers need accurate information about caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease including the benefits of early diagnosis and how to assist caregivers. Physicians need information on how to implement the "detection of any cognitive impairment" requirement in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit included in the Affordable Care Act. Major efforts by both VA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act, support geriatric training for physicians, nurses, <s>and other health workers."</s> <u>social workers, psychologists, dentists, pharmacists, counselors, and allied health professionals</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: We believe it is important as this plan will direct future efforts and funding in this area, that all geriatric disciplines be explicitly mentioned. Psychologists, social workers, and other health care providers play an integral role in VA interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Accordingly, they are included in the ACA expanded training provisions, and are listed on the BHPR website.</p>
<p><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools </em></p>
<p>"The Affordable Care Act created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. 'Detection of any cognitive impairment' must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment and risk for dementia," <u>and to determine the need for referral for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Neuropsychological evaluation remains a critical component of differential diagnostic methods in discriminating neurodegenerative changes from normal age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are related to psychiatric conditions or medical morbidities, and other related disorders. Neuropsychological measures are accurate, early predictors of progression to AD and provide useful information to individuals with dementia and their families regarding the functional capacities of the individual and potential impact of interventions on disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>"Most of the public is aware of Alzheimer's disease; more than 85 percent of people surveyed can identify the disease and its symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is also one of the most-feared health conditions. Yet there are widespread and significant public misperceptions about the <u>prevention</u>, diagnosis, <u>disease management</u>, and treatment." <u>In addition, there is a lack of public understanding of the differences between normal age-related cognitive change and pathological change</u>.</p>
<p><u>These misperceptions can lead both to delayed diagnosis when family members falsely attribute behavioral and memory issues to normal aging and to faulty diagnosis and harmful avoidance behaviors when families become paralyzed with concern about the stigma and decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. Both misconceptions can prevent families from obtaining needed and appropriate supports. They can also lead to inaction in adopting health promoting behaviors such as physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and refraining from smoking, which may prevent or slow any disease process</u>. "Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal because it forms the basis for advancing the subsequent goals of the National Plan. A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease will help engage stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by people with the disease and their families."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Two top tier messages of this campaign should be: 1) AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging; and 2) there are modifiable risk factors for AD (including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity) AND actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. A recent study (Barnes et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>4.A: Educate the public about <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease </em></p>

<p>The Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City represents 1200 families in 37 counties in Kansas and Missouri who are all caring for a loved one with Down syndrome. Many of our parents are gravely concerned about their child, teen or adult's future and the strong likelihood that they will develop dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified. We are aware that there is a lot of corollary research going on between Alzheimer's and Down syndrome and feel that more attention should be paid to this to ensure a bright future for both populations of people.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia. In addition, as a parent or family member, I am aware of the need to provide special supports for caregivers, often siblings or aging parents, who assume responsibilities for the care needs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia.</p>
<p>It is also case that these individuals have special needs that may differ and require different supports than those provided to individuals in the general population. These needs have been identified by the National Task Group and Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices in an action plan it issued as part of its report: <strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports"</em></strong>,which has been submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have research and population specific clinical trials identified clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. They face many challenges that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is not complete unless it fully addresses the Down syndrome population as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of this request!</p>

The Arc has represented individuals with the most significant disabilities for over 60 years.</p>
<p>The Arc is particularly interested in the Council's Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease since the disease has special significance for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Arc was pleased that the draft plan made reference to people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Strategy 2.H. However, we believe that the interests of people with ID should be infused throughout the plan rather than addressed in just two bullet points.</p>
<p>The Arc endorses the comments submitted to the Council by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (ntg). Each of the numerous immediate, near-term, and long-term recommendations for priority actions outlined in the draft plan pertains to individuals with (ID). The needs of people with ID apply to all areas addressed in the draft plan - research, early identification, training of practitioners, support for family caregivers, community-based supports and services, and data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>People with ID are living longer and the number of individuals who have Alzheimer's disease and ID likely will increase. It is incumbent on the Advisory Council to ensure that our nation's public health system is prepared.</p>

<p>The National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS) is a professional organization comprising the directors of state agencies serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The Association assists state IDD agency officials respond to emerging state and federal policy issues that that affect their efforts to ensure the delivery of services and supports to individuals with IDD in their respective states and jurisdictions. Association staff provide member state agencies with extensive technical assistance on a wide range of system and program related issues, in-depth analyses of Medicaid and other federal statutory and regulatory policies affecting people with IDD, and cutting edge information on state-of-the-art programs and service delivery practices. NASDDDS collaborates closely with the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD) and the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG) to improve health and healthcare of people with IDD nationwide.</p>
<p>State IDD service delivery systems are large with total annual state and federal expenditures in excess of $53 billion. Data reported by the University of Minnesota Research and Training Center on Community Living reveal that over 1,000,000 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy and related conditions received publicly financed residential supports through Medicaid and other state/federally funded programs. The majority of these individuals, approximately 57% live with their families, receiving the supports that they need at home, at work and in a variety of in day programs in the community. Of the approximately 440,000 remaining individuals, about 72% live in local group homes or other neighborhood settings of less than 6 persons. Fewer than 28% reside in large state and privately operated institutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this correspondence is to provide feedback to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services regarding the <em>Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. We are pleased that the Draft Plan specifically identifies people with intellectual disabilities in Strategy 2.H as a group of Americans who are at exceptionally high risk for contracting Alzheimer's disease. Including people with IDD in the report recognizes their particular vulnerability to these conditions and suggests the challenges that publicly financed systems of support will need to meet in the very near future. We believe, however, that the report does not go far enough in addressing the specific issues identified by NASDDDS member state agencies and articulated by a national report prepared by NTG entitled, <em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em>, and the related <em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em>. Our specific concerns and suggestions include the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 1</em>. The relationship between the presence of Down Syndrome and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not given proper focus in research and practice recommendations. </strong></p>
<p>Goal 1 of the Draft Plan highlights research but does not reference the need for targeted examination and analysis of the etiology and course of dementia for people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Sustained research in this area is clearly warranted to better understand the course and treatment of the disease and to inform and hopefully improve public policy in this area. We believe that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will also benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, people with Down syndrome demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. It should be emphasized that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that Goal 1 of the Draft Plan emphasize the need for focused basic and treatment research addressing the conditions and support needs of people with Down syndrome at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 2</em>. Addressing the specialized programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS agrees with the observations and recommendations of the NTG that the Council revise the Draft Plan to recognize the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). And that the discussion of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities be mentioned earlier on in this section to make it clear that the strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. It is important that the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same manner as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Furthermore, we believe that it is important that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only address improvements of care for this specific population, but also, are designed to increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that:</p>
<ul><li>The Draft Plan and any resulting guidelines produced include reference to the special circumstances and challenges involved in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities, and that this acknowledgement be placed earlier in the second section so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.B the need for specialized screening instruments that are designed and normed for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The administrative screening tool currently under development by the NTG will have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population that are not normed for use by people with cognitive disabilities.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.E the need for long-term 'dementia capable' services and supports to be offered in small community settings rather than institutional facilities, consistent with the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this small group home model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Issue 3</em>. Need to address the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities. </strong></p>
<p>As noted above, the majority, over 57%, of all people with IDD receiving publicly financed support reside in the home of a family member. The age of family caregivers, like the average age of the U.S. population in general is growing older however, and these caregivers are now themselves needing support. Tragically, the availability of services has not kept pace with the demand for support. Plummeting state budgets and reductions in Medicaid and state-funded supports have expanded waiting lists and placed a greater burden on families with relatives in need of personal care and assistance. The ability to provide quality care to people with IDD who are aging both now and in the future depends on the ability of state and federal service delivery systems to support the capacity of families to furnish needed long term assistance.</p>
<p>The majority of adults with Down Syndrome and other intellectual disabilities need assistance in decision making and consent. Adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs and consideration must be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that the Draft Plan address the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities, (see Strategy 3.C.1)</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 4</em>. Need to expand public education activities to include individuals with IDD and their families. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS believes that Goal 4 be expanded to ensure that the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities are specifically addressed by public education campaigns and to improve coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector. State IDD agencies are instrumental in organizing, managing and delivering services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. It is essential that these state agencies be included in public education efforts and that education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. Aggressive education campaigns addressing the nature of intellectual disabilities and the needs of individuals with IDD should be targeted to universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p>NASDDDS member state agencies furnish a wide array of publicly financed services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. As the age of the population increases, state service delivery systems are working to develop effective strategies for meeting the needs of people with IDD in a way that allows them to age in place and remain a part of their families and communities. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's is an important step forward. We appreciate the work and recommendations of the Advisory Council, not only for the population in general, but particularly for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are especially vulnerable to this condition. NASDDDS gratefully acknowledges the work on this issue by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices and their assistance in forming the recommendations of this Association.</p>

<p>The Iowa Department on Aging is encouraged by the initiation of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. A diagnosis of, or in many cases just a discussion about Alzheimer's disease or related dementia can trigger a sense of fear, foreboding and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's plan has the potential to greatly improve and enhance the current system and help improve the quality of life and quality of care for both people diagnosed and their caregivers. But without adequate funding attached to the proposed goals, we are concerned that systems change is not possible.</p>
<ol><li>To effectively create a system to enhance quality care and efficiency we believe the Plan should dictate minimum standards including, but not limited to the following:
<ul><li>An increased number of hours of education and training required for health care professionals and other disciplines who come in contact with people diagnosed with dementia.</li>
<li>Physician training programs that stress the importance of early detection and diagnosis.</li>
<li>Create and implement dementia unit requirements that include specially trained activity personnel, increased daily programming and adequate social work staff to meet the needs of people living in long-term care facilities.</li>
<li>Dementia care offered in hospitals must include staff with dementia training and enough staff to properly care for patients with a dementia diagnosis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expand patient and family support by enhancing existing systems.
<ul><li>Strengthen the National Family Caregiver Program to ensure that specialists are dementia capable and can provide education, referral and resource information and support to family caregivers who are caring for a person with dementia.</li>
<li>Strengthen the Lifespan Respite Program by providing adequate funds for respite care for people with dementia. Statistics show that access to respite care has a definite impact on the length of time a person can be cared for at home.</li>
<li>Provide access to evidence based programs that demonstrate effective support to all caregivers of people experiencing dementia</li>
<li>Increase psychosocial interventions for the caregiver and care receiver that offer support and assistance for people in home and community based programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enhance public awareness and engagement through an organized, funded campaign to assist the general public in:
<ul><li>Understanding the importance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment.</li>
<li>Understanding the importance of future planning</li>
<li>Becoming knowledgeable about long term living and community support services that are available in local communities
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>The Iowa Department on Aging believes that a nationally funded and coordinated effort is needed to enhance care, expand caregiver support and increase awareness and we support the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should have Address the Mental Health Needs of People with Dementia and their caregivers in its ambitious plan to address Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the draft plan does not provide adequate attention to mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Dementia frequently co-occurs with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems. Recognizing and treating these conditions plays a vital role in improving patients' cognitive functioning as well as the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.</p>

<p>As younger populations become increasingly urban and concentrated, persons more likely to have Alzheimer's or related dementia, become stranded in rural communities without adequate resources or family to assist them as the disease progresses. As jobs become scarce in rural communities, children of the baby boomers have moved where there are better job prospects leaving their parents alone. The community supports simply are not adequate in rural communities to address the specific needs of persons with dementia who have no informal primary caregiver's. Many of these people will end up in nursing facilities, that are ill-equipped to handle the specific care needs of an Alzheimer's patient. Nursing homes are for skilled care; however, Alzheimer's patients frequently do not need skilled care (for much of the disease progression), they simply need supervision, social stimulation, and help with minimal ADL's and IADL's. Nursing facilities have problems handling the behavior of Alzheimer's patients, because they are frequently mobile and cause disturbances with other patients. As a result nursing facilities are reluctant to accept patients with Alzheimer's disease early in disease progression. <strong>The addition of Alzheimer's dementia specific units to nursing facilities, especially in rural communities, would alleviate some of this problem. The staffing would be smaller, and the cost per day to medicare/Medicaid could be reduced as a result.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, for informal caregivers that do live in rural communities, support groups, educational opportunities, and training are absent. In addition, broadband internet is also difficult to obtain do inadequate infrastructure, leaving the caregiver unable to obtain information. The stress of caregiving combined with isolation shortens the amount of time an informal caregiver can increase the chance the persons are placed in nursing facilities for lack of another option. <strong>Providing community training through religious institutions, civic organizations, and other groups would allow for wide dispersal of accurate information, as well as the infrastructure in rural communities, improving early diagnosis and extending the amount of time a person can stay at home with a caregiver by reducing their stress through knowledge and resources.</strong> One way of accomplishing this is to certify persons at the AAAs or County Health Departments to recruit and train volunteers to provide outreach and educational events in their communities.</p>
<p>Another component of stress reduction is respite support. Caregiver's of persons with Alzheimer's or related diseases care for their loved ones for long periods of time. The time spent away from work, church, and family can become taxing and frequent breaks are needed. As there is increased demand for respite, and in the absence of increased funding for flexible respite support one of two options is available: 1) reduce the amount of respite per caregiver or 2) maintain lengthy waiting lists. Both options fail. At some point, respite is ineffective if it is infrequent and for very brief periods of time. If the caregiver waits too long without a break on a waiting list for respite, the caregiver will give up before the programs can provide assistance. <strong>The solution is to increase funding for respite supports through the AAAs, V.A., as well as introduce a income needs based component to respite support programs eligibility requirements.</strong> People that are wealthy ought to pay for their respite, or prove they have paid x amount before they can gain access to subsidized respite support each year. The reach of the programs would extend to those least likely to take a break, because they are unable to afford it.</p>

<p><em>This letter is very similar to my oral testimony (a few corrected typos and better words)--except for my adding a new paragraph at the beginning--to respond more fully to a public comment that preceded mine:</em></p>
<p>A person (Michael Ellenbogen?) who currently suffers from mild Alzheimer's dementia concluded his comments by recommending the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services consider the "right-to-die" option. He thus implied that Physician-Assisted Dying could be an option for patients who suffer from dementia. Because of time limitations, I could only disagree briefly by saying that Physician-Assisted Dying will neither help nor is needed. I now explain more: (1) Why would Physician-Assisted Dying NOT help? Where Physician-Assisted Dying is legal, the law requires patients be of "sound mind" when they ask their physician to write a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Yet dementia patients lose the mental capacity to make medical decisions early in the course of this progressive disease. Thus for dementia patients, Physician-Assisted Dying would compound their tragedy with <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong>. This is because dementia patients can have much good life after they lose capacity--and they can expect more, with further research--so I and many others consider <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong> an act that violates the <strong><em>principle that life is precious</em></strong>. (2) Why is Physician-Assisted Dying NOT needed? Because Living Will forms and the discussions they provoke can be both moral and effective. Combined with other clinical and strategic forms, diligent Advance Care Planning can give people peace of mind, whether they are still well or in the early stage of dementia. They need not worry about being forced to linger for months to years by enduring the huge burdens and suffering that characterize Advanced Dementia. Instead, they can feel confident that others <strong><em>will honor their Known Wishes</em></strong> after they lose the ability to speak for themselves.</p>
<p><em>Here is my original comment:</em></p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is most urgent, <strong>most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend that their patients/clients complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most urgent</strong>? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The reality of the huge, increasing epidemic of patients whose lives will end as they suffer from Alzheimer's disease makes Advance Care Planning even more urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most important</strong>? Because patients can linger in the terminal stage of Alzheimer's Dementia for several years. The relentless course of their disease may frustrate the best efforts of their clinicians, their caregivers and their loved ones. The multiple burdens on others are well known. For example, more than one-third of Alzheimer's caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many who have lost the ability to complain and whose behavior may be atypical, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most challenging</strong>? Unlike other terminal illnesses, often there are no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." They may believe: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. Then, I'll be trapped in a condition I loathe so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only compound the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients effective advance care planning so they can feel confident they can choose to avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then, many will ironically choose to live as long and as well as possible--and benefit from improvements in the medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning for Advanced Dementia needs research funding to develop and to implement--even if other researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. We know that changes in the brains of dementia patients begin one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. We also know it takes many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and to adopt a policy to implement widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers predicted to get dementia are still likely to become demented. Even if a new drug were available today, patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia. Most importantly, when they do reach the advanced stage of dementia, these patients will then have only their Advance Directives on which they can rely, to control <em>how long, and how much, they must suffer</em>before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we must thus fund research programs that will: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend their clients and patients have the discussions and complete the forms...now, while they still can.</p>

<p>My father is the third person I know to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. First was my uncle who passed away in 2005 and then my aunt or father's sister who, although 6 years younger has had it for over two years now.</p>
<p>The impact of this illness on the family is devastating. There is no one place to go for help or all the information you need. It takes a village to handle an aggressive, geriatric Alzheimer's family member. As a caregiver one needs to find out as much as possible as quickly as possible to get the help needed for a loved one. Nobody tells you all the challenges you will have and the financial impact it has on the family as well.</p>
<p>My father was normally an intelligent man, very good with mathematics, science and spoke English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Now we see him unable to handle his finances, becoming increasingly aggressive, suffering from delusions and hallucinations regarding our mother who he has been married to for 62 years.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that a mental healthcare power of attorney was not signed since the lawyers don't mention that when you go to get your will and other papers in order, we had to apply for emergency guardianship to get my father admitted to a level one psychiatric facility. After he is there for three weeks and thoroughly evaluated we are told he cannot come home due to delusions regarding our mother. Now we have to find someplace for him and try to find resources to help us. Unfortunately we end up putting him in a group home which we think is the right thing since it is similar to his home and the advice we get from social workers as well as companies such as Care Patrol, that have familiarity with this illness. Since we have no experience we follow the guidance of these "professionals." Unfortunately in our case perhaps also due to the stressfulness of the situation we did not make the right decision. The home was nice but the caregiver, although a nurse, was not there most of the time, and the other caregivers were Pilipino and did not understand English very well.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse when my brother goes to visit my father and he is in bed at 7:30 since the caregivers don't seem to want to be bothered with the patients. When he arrives my father gets up from bed and falls and the door is locked and the caregivers can't seem to figure out how to get the door opened. My brother finally does and dad is on the floor. The caregivers just leave the area and my brother and his son help my father get back into the bed. My father seems to be in a drug stupor and his eyes roll back in his head. I get a frantic call from my brother and call the hospice since he was on palliative care and ask them to send a nurse immediately since the nurse who owns the group home is not there. I also leave an urgent message for her, which is never returned. I wait and then call for the nurse at the hospice that is on call to find out that she was denied entry into the home by the caregivers who told her he was sleeping and to come back the next day. When I confront the owner of the home the following morning she insists that she called me even though there is no record on my answering machine or caller id on the home or cell phones. Then she also indicates that her mother told her that nobody came to the door from the hospice, which was an outright lie. I immediately started looking for another facility but it was difficult since they are all extremely expensive and my mother is alive and living with physical disabilities at home and all of my father's social security, pension and VA benefits (which I applied for since he was a WWII veteran) have to go in their entirety to his care and we still fall short.</p>
<p>During the time I looked for a facility I asked the group home owner not to transport my father anywhere since there was an issue when we brought him home for lunch prior to that. I had met him at a follow-up appointment with his neurologist and she said we could try to bring him home to see how it went. The first time we tried it he seemed ok but it was after an appointment for a vision test and he refused to get in the car unless we took him home. On that occasion, he managed to get his checkbook which we later found out about since we could not locate it to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The following week he had a dentist appointment due to periodontal disease which we needed to attend to. After that appointment , when we brought him home, he became very agitated and pulled a knife out of a drawer, which usually had only papers(so we can only imagine he had placed it there the week before, since we did not). He sat down and said he was not going back to the group home or as he called it, a jail. Then he said he would kill my husband if he ever saw him again since he was the one who, with my sister, brought him to the hospital. I asked him to return the knife and he took it and put it under some papers behind him. This wasn't a small knife it was a large carving knife. I asked for it back but he refused and then went out back and started cutting plants with it and ended up coming in the house without it. He had hidden it. I sent my sister out to retrieve it and she found it in a bucket outside. I took that knife and the rest that were in the house and put them in the trunk of my car. While I did that he went in the back yard and left from the gate on the side and was halfway down the block on foot. I ran to catch up with him and my sister called the police since we were very concerned and needed to get him back to the group home. When the police came he told them he would go back with us and when they left and we were a few blocks away he lunged over the back seat and grabbed my steering wheel and tried ripping the keys out of my ignition and then grabbed the gear shifter to get the car out of gear. I immediately jammed on the breaks and told my sister, who was sitting next to me, to call 911 and that is when he tried to grab the phone from her. I told him I would go back to the house and proceeded slowly to give the policemen a chance to get there. I went past the house and he became agitated and tried getting out of the car but could not since the child locks were on the doors. Unfortunately I forgot the window locks and he was able to open the window and got his body out up to his hips. I had to stop the car and get his feet back in. This is 5'8" man who weighs 158 lbs. I am only 5'3" and weigh 130. This time four police cars came and the officer ended up having to put my father in his squad car and take him back to the home.</p>
<p>Despite the incident that happened and the fact that the group home owner knew about what happened and was told not to take him out, her husband took my father to the bank a couple of weeks later and the bank rep called my mother and then me since my father was requesting his social security number to take out money.</p>
<p>When I finally found a decent place for my father that specializes in Alzheimer's and dementia care, the group home was very rude and unprofessional with the nurse who came to assess him and asked them in front of my father if they were going to take him to a psychiatric facility. So in addition to all the stress now we had to deal with a group home that was manipulating him so he would not leave. He was also writing them checks, which I got back, but we closed the account to keep anyone from taking advantage of him. He had promised money to them, wrote checks to his attorney who was appointed by the court and was promising thousands to the staff and doctors in the hospital where he was assessed.</p>
<p>On top of everything we ended up getting calls from Elder abuse since the owner of the home was apparently upset that we were taking him out and kept arguing that he wasn't ill despite the medical records from a neurologist and psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Our family has been going through hell. On top of all this there was a tremendous amount of paperwork to get VA benefits, get medications and other medical issues taken care of and the legal expenses for guardianship are bleeding my parent's dry. The emotional impact on our mother and the rest of us has been awful as well.</p>
<p>I tell you all this so you can see what it is like since none of us ever imagined how awful this would be. I don't think anyone knows what it is like until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Waiting until 2025 is too late. In my visits to many facilities I have seen people in their 40's and 50's with the disease and it will only get worse as the baby boomers age. With twice as many of them as their parent's generation we are in for a healthcare meltdown if something isn't put in place soon. We need to do something now. I am sure we are not the only family going through this.</p>
<p>There should be more research into different modalities (allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, etc.) to address this illness. I have read that there are studies being done regarding a cancer medication that is on the market that reduces the amyloid plaque in the brain. This is the website: <a href="http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html">http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html</a>.</p>
<p>I have also read about a possible treatment or preventative in raw coconut oil by a doctor who used it on her spouse: <a href="http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf">http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf</a>. Perhaps the cure or prevention lies in a combination of different modalities and all should be considered.</p>
<p>Families need more financial assistance and better resources where they can find all or most of the information needed with respect to legal, medical and assisted living resources as well as support groups to help families get the assistance they need as quickly as possible. Most of what is out there now is just "you are on your own" looking though websites in the midst of a crisis trying to find the help and guidance you need or other families at support groups trying to help each other. When a family is in constant crisis they need as much assistance/guidance as quickly as possible to help them navigate the system of care so they can make the right decisions for their loved one.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the findings but it must also be noted that some co-occurring chronic conditions such as sleep apnea (<a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021">http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021</a>) hearing loss (<a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study</a>) and periodontal disease (<a href="http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html">http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html</a>)should also be included in annual geriatric screenings since they can be directly linked to causing dementia and may be overlooked. In addition something should be put in place regarding hearing loss and the prohibitive cost of hearing aids. Perhaps insurance companies can increase fees by a few dollars a month on their premiums to include some coverage for hearing aids. Everyone is impacted by hearing loss of a senior citizen: family, motorists who drive on the roads along with them, and anyone who the hearing impaired interact with. Since hearing loss can be linked to dementia making hearing aids more affordable through some sort of coverage could help in part, to address this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone directly related to the care of a patient with dementia or Alzheimer's and affiliated with a medical facility, assisted living, or group home should need to be certified to care for a patient with this illness and display that certification where it is visible to family who are looking for care for their family member. There are people who claim to know how to handle patient s with this illness, yet do not, and tend to take advantage of the family as well as the person with the illness.</p>
<p>There should be clear guidelines in place as to what the group homes can and cannot do such as taking a dementia patient to the bank to take out money. I bring this up since this happened with my father.</p>
<p>Medical assessments in the home would help greatly as well since it can be impossible to get a dementia patient to the doctor or hospital unless you have a mental health care power of attorney. If a patient is hospitalized and determined to have dementia, a mental health care power of attorney should automatically be granted without the family having to dish out thousands of dollars to an attorney when the person has received a neurological and psychological evaluation by qualified physicians. This would save the families of these patients thousands of dollars which can be used for their care. A regular health care power of attorney is insufficient since we were told that Alzheimer's and dementia are considered physical illnesses with psychological manifestations. Without a mental health care power of attorney the family has to file for emergency guardianship and then permanent guardianship which can cost upwards of $20,000. This is a progressive disease with no known cure at this point. It is ridiculous to penalize an already suffering family to have to deplete their savings when their loved one is only going to progress in mental deterioration and obviously needs a guardian. Many times they feel that they are not ill and will continue to fight and deplete their funds further until they end up on ACCHHS (Medicaid), which in turn just depletes the government's funds further. If this is a necessity perhaps some cost containment should be put in place so families aren't hurt financially by exorbitant legal fees.</p>
<p>Another issue is medication. The VA indicates it can help with the cost of medication but you have to bring the patient into their facility. Once they are in a memory care facility they are not always amenable to being transported so it would be of great help to have a VA rep come to the patient facility to assess them for the medication benefits or just to have the paperwork from the doctor diagnoses serve as proof that the person needs the medication and provide it and delivery at no cost to the veteran.</p>
<p>The facility that my father is currently in provides dental care via mobile dentistry. It would also be beneficial to have the same with respect to mobile hearing units to help many of the residents in these facilities to get the hearing assessments and hearing aid cleaning, hearing aids, wax removal, etc. to ensure that they can hear effectively. Mobile vision care would also be a plus to ensure that the patients are seeing well or are not developing illnesses of the eye.</p>
<p>Finally decent memory care facilities are very expensive (the one our father is now at costs $4,338/mo.) and that it would help greatly to have some sort of coverage to help as the only thing available is long term care insurance which many people do not have and once you are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is no longer an option.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these suggestions into consideration in your National Plan. After going through all of this first hand I can tell you that these changes are greatly needed and would help all the families out there who are going through all of these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>AAN Comments on Draft <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the American Academy of Neurology, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the highly comprehensive and needed <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> (Plan).</p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is the largest scientific and professional organization for neurology in the United States. Representing more than 25,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals, the AAN strives to promote the highest quality patient centered neurologic care. The AAN is proud to support the overall Plan and fully supports the vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease. The AAN is further pleased that a neurologist, Dr. Ron Petersen, was named as chairman of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>The AAN is committed to playing an active role in supporting the objectives of the Plan. Our feedback in the following areas is provided for your consideration as you refine the Plan framework:</p>
<ul><li>Neurologists' Role in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</li>
<li>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</li>
<li>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</li>
<li>Quality Measurement Considerations</li>
<li>Current AAN Dementia-related Resources</li>
<li>Submission to the CMI on Alzheimer's Care Delivery</li>
<li>Concluding Remarks</li>
</ul><p><strong>Neurologists' Role in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br />
					The science and practice of neurology are integral to efforts to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD), diagnose it, treat it, and slow its progression, as well as, provide support for patients suffering from the disease and their caregivers. Neurologists are specifically trained to manage AD and other chronic disorders of the brain and central nervous system.</p>
<p>Neurologists:</p>
<ul><li>Conduct basic and translational AD research</li>
<li>Provide a comprehensive assessment including clinical diagnostic evaluation and evaluation of cognitive deterioration over time</li>
<li>Make decisions regarding treatment for patients with AD " Engage in follow-up visits every three to six months for patients with AD</li>
<li>Provide patients and caregivers with decision aids, such as comprehensive end-of-life counseling and advance care planning</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of multidisciplinary teams, neurologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD. The role of the neurologist in the care continuum of AD is critical.</p>
<p>Many factors contribute to the current variations in care that patients with AD receive in the US. The AAN believes that improving care coordination among health care providers, strengthening education and support for AD caregivers, and increasing rates of early diagnosis would have a significant impact.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.A.: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</strong><br />
					The AAN strongly supports increased investment in AD research. Current funding levels are vastly disproportionate to impact of the disease now, and will be greatly exacerbated as prevalence increases in the future as the US population ages if funding trends remain unaltered. In addition, there is a tremendous gap between the research budgets for AD and dementia (approximately $450 million) and the research budgets for other diseases like HIV/AIDs (approximately $3 billion). The AAN believes in the need to raise the profile of AD research to bring it in line with its present and expected impact to the country.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</strong><br />
					Expanded educational efforts are important in reducing care variations and preparing the health care work force for an aging population. However, the AAN would note further support for expanding the supply of well-trained specialists is critical as more complex diagnostic tests and AD therapies become available.</p>
<p>The AAN agrees that a sufficient workforce is necessary to have high quality health care. Though reimbursement issues are not directly addressed in the Plan, they undoubtedly shape care delivery. Spending needed time face-to-face with patients diagnosing and coordinating care for complex neurologic diseases such as AD is undervalued in the current fee-for-service payment model. A lack of proper payment threatens the future supply of individuals trained specifically in neurology, which is of particular concern since neurologists are key to a timely diagnosis.</p>
<p>There is a large role for case managers to handle some of the social aspects of AD care, including the provision of support or information about next steps to caregivers, so that physician can focus on medical issues.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Measurement Considerations</strong><br />
					Since there is still limited evidence and effective treatments for AD, it is intrinsically difficult to develop high standard quality measures. However, the AAN agrees that care quality should be measured to the extent possible, and has developed a quality measure set for dementia that was recently approved by the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI).</p>

<p><strong>Submission to the CMI on Alzheimer's Care Delivery</strong><br />
					The AAN met with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in early 2012 to discuss a suggested concept for modernizing the way care is delivered to patients with AD through a cooperative care team including neurologists, geriatricians/primary care physicians, geriatric psychologists, neuropsychologists, case managers, social workers, nurses, dietitians, and pharmacists. The concept goes on to address a major problem in the current delivery system for AD care: the misalignment of financial incentives that are causing monetary constraints to providing coordinated care.</p>

<p><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><br />
					Broad collaborations with private and non-profit entities should be encouraged and incentivized at the grassroots level to accomplish many of the goals outlined in the Plan, especially those involving caregiver support and quality of life interventions for patients. The AAN stands ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, and specialists), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and dissemination of its work. The AAN remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We appreciate your consideration of our comments.

<p>There are numerous improvements in the draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease from the initial framework plan. Additional areas of the plan still need strengthening and improvement. CCAL appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to help strengthen the draft plan. The comments follow.</p>
<p><strong>General </strong></p>
<ul><li>CCAL suggests that the plan include the words "other dementias" and be known as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias. The terms "Alzheimer's" and "dementia" are often used interchangeably. Many internists and family practice physicians (among others in the health care field), for example, are still not well educated about assessing and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and use the general term "dementia" to explain cognitive decline to patients and their families. The addition of the terminology "other dementia" is more inclusionary and desirable.</li>
<li>Person-centered care is the widely recognized gold standard of services and supports for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PWD) (Alzheimer's Association, 2006; Edvardsson, et al, 2010). It is a foundational aspect of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The draft plan is silent about person-centered care. CCAL suggests that the plan integrate the philosophy and orientation to person-centered care throughout the plan.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Challenges Section</strong> (page 4)</p>
<ul><li>Notably missing as a national challenge is the over prescription and utilization of antipsychotic medications as a first line of management for behavioral challenges experienced by PWDs. The medical community as well as the formal and informal caregiver communities need to be educated about non-pharmacologic approaches to such behavioral challenges as agitation. Medications should be used only if and when non-pharmacologic approaches have not been effective. There is currently a dearth of readily accessible information about recommended non-pharmacologic approaches and practices.</li>
<li>Also missing as a national challenge is recognition that the quality of programs and services for PWDs who reside in residential long-term care (assisted living, nursing homes) across the nation continues to be uneven and often less than optimal. There is no national focus on or effort to address quality for these long-term care programs and services despite the fact that the number of people living with dementia will increase over fifty percent by 2030.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Plan's Three Guiding Principles</strong> (page 5)</p>
<ul><li>CCAL applauds the second Guiding Principle that supports public-private partnerships. We recommend that the detail for this principle be expanded to specifically include dementia experts who represent the practice, policy, and research sectors. All too often senior executives are included on advisory panels solely because of their positions. Unfortunately they often lack actual dementia expertise and experience. It is vitally important that the national plan be developed, planned, and implemented by a diverse group of dementia experts who can provide "face validity" both to the plan and the process of its development and implementation.</li>

<p>The suffering of people with Alzheimer's Disease and their family caregivers is invariably compounded by depression and anxiety. These are among the most devastating daily effects of the disease, undermining the quality of life of both caregivers and patients and limiting their ability to contribute to society in a meaningful and economically viable way. Any effort to improve the management of the disease should therefore include a program of psychological intervention as well as medical research and therapy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><em>The Problem</em><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1,2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3,4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just ot have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><em>The Solution</em>: Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meeting these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiences come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stokeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</li>
<li><strong>FNIH Biomakers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</li>
<li><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment forAlzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</li>
<li><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</li>
</ul><p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>Please see below for my feedback on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. I am a gerontological clinical social worker with over ten years experience in the field of dementia care. I was formerly the Director of Social Services at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, and now I am a doctoral candidate who teaches and conducts research on dementia care at Columbia University School of Social Work.</p>
<p>Congratulations on creating such a progressive plan of action. I hope that my feedback is of value. I would be delighted to get involved in any of the efforts related to finalizing this national plan or taking action on any of the activities outlined within the plan. Please contact me with any questions, comments, or concerns.</p>
<p>Positive Feedback:</p>
<ul><li>The plan is overwhelmingly comprehensive in breadth of scope and depth of detail.</li>
<li>The lists of challenges and guiding principles for the national plan are thoughtfully crafted and easily justified.</li>
<li>This plan looks to make substantial achievements toward fulfilling the objectives of NAPA with both immediate and long-range potential benefits to our citizens.</li>
<li>The inclusion of diverse stakeholders' input, as well as plans to coordinate efforts across federal agencies, shows dedication to setting realistic priorities and working toward meaningful outcomes.</li>
</ul><p>Constructive Criticism:</p>
<p>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</p>
<ul><li>The professions identified in this Action Statement are surely appropriate targets of the relevant activities, but the exclusion of the social work profession is a major oversight. This oversight is not repeated in Action 2.A.3 on dementia-specific guidelines and curricula, which shows some acknowledgement on the part of NAPA representatives of the value of a competent social work workforce. Social workers are integral members of the professional care teams in every setting and program of health, mental health, and aging services. They perform essential roles which are crucial to the successful delivery of those services, and this is especially true in the context of the multidimensional, bio-psycho-social domains of need in dementia care. Look to the work of the John A. Hartford Foundation's Geriatric Social Work Initiative for information on the importance of shoring up for a gerontologically-competent social work workforce, as well as for models of successful workforce development.</li>
</ul><p>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</p>
<ul><li>The Action Statement suggests a plan for HHS to seek input from public and private entities to complete this activity, but it does not detail a process for identifying or selecting providers of such input. With regard to collecting social work guidelines and curricula, I gladly offer my assistance. There are few such guidelines on social work practice in dementia care, and even fewer curricula. However, this is truly my area of expertise, I have lists of the few resources available, I have developed a graduate social work course exclusively on dementia, and I know of several other experts who would also be willing to assist in this effort.</li>
</ul><p>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</p>
<ul><li>The direct-care workforce includes both those who work in private homes and those who work in facilities, yet this Action Statement is focused exclusively on nursing home personnel. Failure to include home health and home care personnel in this effort would be a tremendous oversight. The preferred location of care for nearly all citizens is their own home, the quality of home care services is known to be inadequate for the general population, and to date there are no research studies which have attempted to examine appropriate home care service models, training protocols, patient and family outcomes, and worker outcomes related to dementia care in the home environment. The home health care and home care industries must be strengthened if we are to avoid a crisis in care. Federal money and coordinated efforts among federal and state agencies, and private industry stakeholders, must be dedicated to addressing improvements in the quality of home care services for individuals living with dementia.</li>
</ul><p>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</p>
<ul><li>The importance of reducing the abuse, neglect and exploitation of individuals with dementia cannot be overstated. Toward this end, the Action Statement should be revised to call specific attention to the need to educate District Attorneys and Assistant District Attorneys about responding to charges brought against alleged perpetrators as a result of police and Protective Services investigations. This is particularly important for victims with dementia who lack the capacity, and often the availability of capable advocates, necessary for seeking justice and protection. For example, financial exploitation charges filed by Protective Service agents are rarely addressed by District Attorneys, and, as a result, the perpetrators are not brought to justice and the elders' funds are not restored.</li>
<li>Adult Protective Service programs are generally overwhelmed and understaffed. Certain states have taken the lead in developing more highly effective programs for dealing with elder mistreatment, such as the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs which supports programs for Elder Protective Services and Elders at Risk. These elder-specific programs should be required in each state. In addition, all Protective Services agents should have access to dementia-specific education. When the victims of elder abuse are individuals with dementia, their vulnerabilities are unique, the investigations are additionally complex, and the intervention options are distinct.</li>
</ul><p>Action 3.E.2: Examine patterns of housing and services</p>
<ul><li>Efforts to understand professional care services must now look beyond simple profiles of service availability and use in order to study the effectiveness and efficiency of the services. Access and use of a service are important issues to measure, but the quality of care provided by these formal service systems (most of which are regulated at the state level) needs to be studied as well. Anecdotal and research-based evidence continually suggests that consumers do not receive adequate care, families are not relieved of their burdens by using formal care services, and community-based services do not effectively postpone nursing home placement. Investments in improved quality of care would likely result in significant long-range savings due to reduced worker turnover, delayed family burnout, delayed nursing home placements, reduced hospitalizations for avoidable medical and behavioral complications, and fewer transitions between care settings.</li>
<li>This Action Statement calls for an in-depth analysis of the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities, but should also include the further development and analysis of the National Home and Hospice Care Survey.</li>
</ul><p>General concern-</p>
<ul><li>This plan does not provide adequate attention to mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers. Dementia frequently co-occurs with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems. Recognizing and treating these conditions plays a vital role in improving patients' cognitive functioning as well as the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.</li>

<p>The California Mental Health Planning Council (CMHPC) is mandated by federal and state statute to advocate for children with serious emotional disturbances and adults and older adults with serious mental illness, to provide oversight and accountability for the public mental health system, to advise the Administration and the Legislature on priority issues, and to participate in statewide planning. With passage of the Mental Health Services Act, the Planning Council also has responsibilities related to workforce development.</p>
<p>One of the Systems of Care Committees that support the Planning Council is the Older Adult Committee (OAC). At our quarterly meeting that took place in San Diego, CA January 18-20, 2012, the OAC discussed the problems counties are experiencing in regard to providing older adults who have mental health diagnosis integrated care when they begin to display cognitive problems associated with the onset of dementia/Alzheimer's disease. We are concerned that as their cognitive abilities decline, their level of care will suffer. Full integration of care is what we feel they deserve. Older adults with mental illness dealing with yet another serious health issue deserve our support.</p>
<p>The OAC strongly believes that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must address the mental health needs of people with dementia/Alzheimer's disease. As the final plan is completed, we urge you to address the mental health needs of people with dementia/Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive issues as well as their caregivers who also deserve our attention. By recognizing and treating all these conditions we will improve the functioning of our patients as well as improving the quality of life for them and their caregivers.</p>

<p>Please address the mental health issues to go along with Alzheimer's Disease. My mother-in-law currently has this disease and suffers from depression and anxiety due to the frustrations that she feels in not remembering things. It is only getting worse as the disease progresses. This is a common issue. Currently she is in a skilled nursing facility because her husband passed away several years ago. He had been her caretaker. This disease takes a great toll on anyone who keeps their loved ones in their home, because constant vigilance is needed on a regular basis. This isolates the caregiver as well as the one suffering from Alzheimer's. This can lead to depression for the caregiver. Please address the mental health aspects that accompany this disease in developing your plan regarding Alzheimer's.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments I will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:center"><tbody><tr><th scope="col" style="text-align:center"><strong>Goals</strong></th>

<td style="text-align:center"><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the only priority of the Plan; its other four goals are of very limited importance.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I do not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But expecting to achieve this by 2025 is wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>I suppose those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts regarding Alzheimer's and other dementias could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere. But this is at best a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly urge HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are the sections of the plan that should reflect behavioral health needs.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, but</p>
<ul><li>The clear priority is bio-medical research seeking pharmacological treatments. There is also a great need for research regarding non-pharmacological, psycho-social interventions, which hold great promise for improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers virtually immediately.</li>
<li>In addition, there is a great need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. It is true that these medications are over-used for people with dementia and can be dangerous. Fortunately, it is also true that non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers, also need information about how to detect co-occurring mental or substance use disorders and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. People with dementia and/or their family members are often served in these settings. And when people with AD in crisis, it is usually the mental health system that is turned to for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders-end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with psychiatric disabilities, who often develop dementia as they age, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia. They, as well as caregivers, can benefit from informational material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other formal care settings such as assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. It is also important to address the likely overuse of anti-psychotics for people with dementia who live in their own homes or with family caregivers.</p>
<p>In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia and should be used only after non-pharmacological interventions have been tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful, failing to mention assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, housing for people with developmental disabilities, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan also fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders make them too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>In addition, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that <strong>there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone</strong>. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>I hope that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what to include in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. Let me add that behavioral health services are not only important for those who are experiencing mental or substance use disorders. In addition, <strong>care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia could result in vastly improved quality of life for them</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better for people with dementia and their families, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking an ultimate solution when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts to develop a national plan to address the growing crisis of Alzheimer's Disease. As an elder law attorney who has worked for many years with low income caregiving families in diverse ethnic communities, I understand the urgency of your work. I applaud your efforts to be both comprehensive and realistic in the development of this plan. My own work with Alzheimer's families began through a program called El Portal -- a Latino Alzheimer's project that was funded through the Alzheimer's DiseaseSupportive Services Program (ADSSP), once called the Alzheimer's Federal-State Matching Grant Program. Later I worked with Asian caregivers through another ADSSP-funded program, the API Dementia Care Network. Like many other elder care professionals in this community, this grant brought me into the Alzheimer's cause where I have worked for over 20 years.</p>
<p>As I look over the plan, I am concerned that I do not see any reference to this program. I believe it is the only federally-funded program that uniquely targets dementia patients and their families with support and education services. Specifically, this is a program that could help to fund the part of the plan devoted to populations disproportionately affected by AD and populations facing care challenges, such as racial and ethnic minorities (Strategy 2H). It could also be referenced in section 2.C.2 as it definitely enhances assistance to people with AD and their caregivers. This program supports and educates people with the disease and caregivers, a significant concern addressed in the plan.</p>
<p>I have heard that there is a possibility that funding for the worthy program may be eliminated and that it has already been reduced. I urge you to use the NAPA planning process to assure that this program remains in place and continues to help develop services for under-served, at-risk populations. It may not be a perfect program but it is the ONLY federal program supporting this work for patients with AD and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you for attending to my feedback. I hope it will strengthen our plan to prepare for the public health crisis that is Alzheimer's Disease.</p>

<p>We, Drs. Matthew P. Janicki and Seth M. Keller, are the co-chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. On behalf of the National Task Group, we wish to make our thoughts and recommendations available to the Advisory Council with respect to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To complement the National Alzheimer's Plan Act process, the National Task Group was convened and produced a report titled, "<strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em></strong>", which was designed, in part, to develop and enhance community care options for aging adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The National Task Group also issued the "<strong><em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em></strong>" as part of this report. The National Task Group issued this Action Plan in January 2012 in the hopes that it would promote better understanding of how adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities age and how dementia, in particular, affects them.</p>
<p>We note that the issues we identified in the National Task Group's report, which was submitted to the Advisory Council at its January 17th meeting, has many parallels with those raised in the Draft Plan. Our report summarized and addressed some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Our report also noted that older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have special needs that at times require different actions than those provided for people in the general population. Alzheimer's disease affects everyone; but not everyone can be treated the same way when they are affected by this disease.</p>
<p>We have submitted these comments in order to clarify and provide feedback to the Advisory Council regarding its Draft Plan. First, we would like to note that the National Task Group is pleased that the Draft Plan contains mention of intellectual disabilities (in Strategy 2.H) as this group of Americans is composed of a significant number of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for Alzheimer's disease. We also would like the Draft Plan to contain at least mention of some general issues that we have raised in our Report and also have more elaboration on some key specific issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Given this, we'd like to offer the following comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Missing mention of the significance of Down syndrome in Alzheimer's research</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the text under Goal 1, neglects mention of the research with respect to the needs of people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certainly sustained research is warranted to better understand the etiology and course of dementia in this group of individuals. Additionally, notwithstanding the competing beliefs of whether research involving people with Down syndrome will benefit general research into the nature and cause of Alzheimer's disease, we feel that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will certainly benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down syndrome also demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. We would like to emphasize that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention that given the high risk of Alzheimer's disease among adults with Down syndrome, there is the continued need for focused basic and treatment research involving people with Down syndrome -- and this should be included under Goal 1. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>We note with satisfaction that the Advisory Council's Draft Plan recognized the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). However, we would like to recommend that mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities receive mention earlier in this section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. We would like to see the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Further, under the Strategies noted under Goal 2, it is important to propose that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only look into improvements of care for this specific population, but also, and perhaps more importantly, increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities earlier in the second section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</em></strong></p>
<p>Under Strategy 2.B, we would also like to recommend that mention be made of the challenges of carrying out effective screening and diagnoses for dementia among most individuals with intellectual disabilities due to their inherently varying abilities and cognitive functions. When nationally applicable instrumentation is developed or recommended it would be highly beneficial to make mention in the Draft Plan of the need for specialized screening instruments for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The National Task Group is currently undertaking the development of such an administrative screen, which would have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population. Recognition of this special need and work by the National Task Group would go far to gain acceptance of a regularized screen applicable to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We also would recommend -- adding text under Strategy 2.E -- that the notion that community care, as noted in the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, be the paramount means of long-term 'dementia capable' care delivery. We note specifically the growing evidence-based research that is supporting the inclusion of small group homes -- as a viable assisted living model -- and their role as a potentially powerful alternative care setting for people with dementia, and in particular those with lifelong disabilities. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with certain intellectual disabilities and that any national guidelines produced contain this consideration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also strongly recommend the consideration of the use of small group homes for the community 'dementia capable' care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia as backed by evidence-based research in the intellectual disabilities field.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>As many adults with intellectual disabilities and in particular those with Down syndrome remain in their family homes living with their parents or other family caregivers as they grow older, it is crucial that under Goal 3 inclusion of the challenges faced by these caregivers -- when providing care-at-home to their relatives with intellectual disabilities and dementia -- be given due mention. These 'life-long caregivers' warrant special attention in the Draft Plan as they are providing an important and crucial bulwark against costly institutionalization and oft-times inappropriate admissions to long-term care facilities. They are also often vexed by emerging symptoms of dementia in their adult children who have successfully mastered many general activities of daily living and now are manifesting decline. Special mention to the situations of these lifelong caregivers should be made in the Draft Plan. In this context, the National Task Group also recommends that Strategy 3.C.1. be amended to recognize that in many settings concerned with adults with intellectual disabilities, decisions are often made by proxy (and not by 'middle-aged adults') and that adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs. Thus, consideration should be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the enhanced public education resources related to intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Under Goal 4, we strongly recommend including the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities under public education campaigns and that the greater coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector should get mention. As the state developmental disabilities authorities (agencies) are instrumental in helping organize state functions and programs with respect to intellectual and developmental disabilities it would be extremely beneficial to include these entities (and state developmental disabilities planning councils) in any public education efforts at the state level. Also, education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. As there are health care disparities, an aggressive education campaign should involve universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists as it relates to cognitive and functional disability and its detrimental effect on caregivers and quality of life of the individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The National Task Group recognizes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. Given this, we are very pleased that the Advisory Council recognized the import of the special challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this group in Strategy 2.H. We would hope for those adults with intellectual disabilities currently affected by dementia and those in the next generation who may be affected (as the timeline for the NAPA process encompasses the next 13 years) that the Advisory Council will recognize other areas of inclusion of the specific issues affecting individuals with intellectual disabilities within the Draft Plan and accept our recommendations for additional areas of mention and focus.</p>
<p>We trust the our comments and recommendations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are provided -- as the collective concerns and thoughts of a significant body of professionals, scientists, administrators, family caregivers and advocates, and persons personally affected by dementia -- who are represented by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</p>

<p>I'd like to commend the Department of Health &amp; Human Services for developing an ambitious plan to address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I would add, however, some concern about its apparent overemphasis on biology and pharmacology. Based on my own clinicial experience, chats with colleagues, and reading of the related literature, I can confidently state this focus is necessary but not sufficient. The mental health (i.e., depression &amp; anxiety) of patients and unpaid caregivers alike is inextricably linked to this disease and its treatment. Should these psychological components remain unaddressed, the costs (financial &amp; human) will continue to mount. Conversely, adequate support can reduce this burden, both at the individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>Experts estimate it will take decades before "cures" for Alzheimer's are discovered, let alone made available (and affordable) broadly. While this remains an appropriate aspirational goal, behavioral treatment of the millions currently afflicted, and support for those trying to care for them, must not be sacrificed.</p>

<p>As a Social Worker addressing the needs of seniors with mental health issues, I see how overwhelming the diagnosis of Dementia can be for patients and the people who care for them.</p>
<p>Many people are in denial over the diagnosis and its consequences, and who can blame them?</p>
<p>There is no cure at this time, and more and more support services have been limited.</p>
<p>Please provide for the mental health needs of patients and their families, as the following are increasingly evident:</p>

<p>Please consider the best treatment practices for people and caregivers who are struggling daily with this illness. It's becoming one of the greatest mental health challenge we must face in the future. A comprehensive approach must be considered in the treatment practices as the myriad of this illness will eventually affect us all in some way or another. The co- occurring mental conditions that are experienced by both the patients and caregivers need to be taken seriously as it greatly affect their quality of life. It is our duty as professionals to ensure that the best is offered at all times to others who rely on our expertise/training. Thank you.</p>

<p>I am very heartened to learn that the federal government released a draft of a comprehensive plan to address Alzheimer's disease. I do want to voice my fervent hope that adequate attention is paid to the mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers in the government's plan.</p>
<p>I worked as a psychiatric social worker for 17 years on a locked inpatient hospital geriatric unit, where the predominant diagnoses were Alzheimers or Dementia with agitation, depression, delusions and/or hallucinations. I witnessed the range and severity of symptoms that caused elderly people with dementia to neglect themselves, to become violent, refuse help offered to them even by their own loving children, to become paranoid toward loving family members, and the devastating effects this had on families. Without access to mental health treatment provided by knowledgeable geriatric psychiatrists and other practitioners, these individuals suffering from dementia would remain in agony and distress, harmful to themselves and others.</p>
<p>I applaud our government for addressing Alzheimers disease and urge you to carefully consider the mental health needs of this population in planning for the future.</p>

<p>As you draw up plans to address the needs of the growing population of people with Alzheimers Disease and dimentia I ask that you would consider the <em>mental</em> health needs of both the caregivers and the patients.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law has been declining as a result of alzheimers, and as one of a many family member team that takes shifts caring for her I know how rough it is to maintain a positive attitude and stamina as her condition declines from one plateau to another.</p>
<p>If you are developing a <em>comprehensive</em> plan, I would think it would be critical to recognize the challenges of mental health and well-being as part of that overall picture, and include steps in your plan to support a mentally healthy population.</p>
<p>Please do not under estimate this critical aspect. The mental attitude of both the patient and the caregiver(s) can make an enormous difference in whether the patient is happy and the caregiver is attentive and loving.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy. I have signed onto a letter drafted by Michael Friedman, MSW and signed on by the vast majority of members of a group of experts assembled in December of 2011, in Washington DC, by SAMHSA, to inform them of the psychosocial, mental health and behavioral issues, concerns and strategies that should be included in the NAPA plan. We are all disappointed that few, if any of our input has been included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>I support everything in the letter from the group but would add the following two comments:</p>
<ol><li>Not only do we need more research on psychosocial interventions, but also on creative engagement interventions. There is an increasing number of successful art and creativity programs (Stagebridge, Kairos Dance, TimeSlips, SPARK, Art Care, Memories in the Making) for persons with dementia, that are making a difference in the quality of life not only for the person, but also for the caregivers. We all know that most aggressive or violent behavior in persons with dementia is behavior that is trying to communicate something else besides aggression; most often pain, boredom, grief, loneliness or urgency of personal body functions. As we develop relationships with people with dementia, we learn their language and can anticipate their unspoken needs by learning what they are communicating to us. Creative engagement and art programs can provide fun and adult-like experience that help us to hear the voices of those with dementia and to avert disaster before it happens.</li>
<li>I would also add that in searching for alternatives to nursing homes for those with Alzheimer's disease, consider the thousands of adult day health care programs that are providing creative and psychosocial interventions, as well as nursing care to over 260,000 participants and family caregivers. ADS have become a preferred platform for chronic disease management with much higher percentages of care provided for hypertension, physical disability, cardiovascular disease, mental illness and developmental disability. (Metlife, 2010). These are all medical issues that compound the care of persons with Alzheimer's disease. According to this national survey, conducted in 2010, by The Ohio State University and funded by MetLife Mature Market Institute, the adult day centers are leaders in community based care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. (over 75% of centers offer cognitive and memory training programs, and educational programs for Alzheimer's disease).</li>
</ol><p>I hope that you will find these comments helpful in identifying what to include in the final national plan for persons with Alzheimer's in America. We do need research for persons with dementia, but not only for new drug interventions. We need research in these psychological and psychosocial interventions also. We must not ignore the 5.4 million persons living with Alzheimer's disease NOW!</p>

<p>I would like to submit a few comments regarding the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. First, NAPA is a wonderful thing and long overdue. Second, thanks to the drafters who clearly state on page 3 that "Alzheimer's disease" as used also includes related dementias. My husband has Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and when someone refers to Alzheimer's, I am always the little voice that chimes in with, "...and don't forget the related dementias."</p>
<p>I hope that when the "experts" meet to discuss and forge the plans, they will include ideas from caregivers in the process. I've learned a tremendous amount from my experience with my husband's illness over the last several years, and believe I could provide valuable input about what it's like in the trenches.</p>
<p>A few items that I would like to specifically comment on:</p>
<p>page 4, a note that AD patients are hospitalized 2-3 times more than others: Often they are sent to the hospital and shouldn't be. The ER is a terrifying experience for them, and sometimes they are just exhibiting symptoms of their illness and don't even need the repeated MRIs, CT scans, and other tests that come back negative every time.</p>
<p>Throughout the document, references are made to provider education and outreach in various settings. This is my personal goal, as I have found that hospital and other staff, unless specifically trained in dementia diseases, are pretty much clueless as to caring for AD patients. One nurse in an excellent hospital in Las Vegas even told me, after caring for my husband as an inpatient, that he was "very confused." Really?</p>
<p>page 21, Goal 3: What does this mean? I hope the needs of caregivers will be addressed by talking to actual caregivers, and not just health care professionals who don't live this disease on a daily basis. (Also, what are "informatics?")</p>
<p>page 23-24, money issues: Why don't we have long-term care? For the middle class (us), it was not affordable at the time, and now it's impossible. More needs to be done to bring costs down for AD patients - they usually don't need skilled nursing care, just compassionate assistance. Also mentioned on page 25, housing options - I would be interested in participating in this discussion.</p>
<p>page 24, Strategy 3D: I agree that this is very important. However, I have found that sometimes the pendulum swings too far the other way, and I as a long-term spouse am viewed with suspicion. This is another goal of mine - to get government agencies and institutions at all levels to understand the difference between a person caring for their long-term spouse and someone who would exploit or abuse the AD patient.</p>
<p>page 26, Goal 4: Yes, we need to educate the public! But sometimes educational programs and materials are written or presented in a manner that the general public cannot understand. Short and simple is best!</p>
<p>page 28, Goal 5: Data is important - is there a way to also include anecdotal evidence?</p>
<p>Thank you for receiving comments. I guess I could summarize my thoughts by asking that the compilation of the Plan include input from real people who are experiencing the terrors of this disease each day.</p>

<p>The Mental Health Association in New York State, Inc., the undersigned, is writing in response to the draft National Alzheimer's Plan recently released for comment by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>We are all pleased that a National Alzheimer's Plan is being developed in recognition of the vast growth of the number of people who will have Alzheimer's or other dementias during the elder boom, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft plan.</p>
<p>However, we all believe that the draft plan is inadequate in several critical ways.</p>
<p><strong>Imbalance of Use of Funding</strong>: The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to deal with Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future, but it does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83%) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. That's less than $2 per person. This is simply not adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Attention to Research About Psychosocial Interventions</strong>: The clear tilt of the draft plan is towards research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. It seems to focus heavily on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. Prevention, cure, or effective slowing of the progression of dementia are, of course, much to be desired. But we do not believe that it is at all likely that this will be achieved by 2025--the goal of this plan--and even if it is, the millions of people who now have or will develop dementia prior to that will not be helped at all.</p>
<p>We know that psychosocial interventions can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers, but we need to know more--to develop truly evidence-based practices. We strongly urge those developing the research plan to pay much more attention to research about psycho-social interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Attention to Mental Disorders Commonly Experienced by People with Dementia and their Caregivers</strong>: People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. (See Lyketsos, et al) When this happens, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. Yet, the role of the mental health system is barely reflected in the draft plan.</p>
<p>In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. There are evidence-based family support interventions. (See Mittelman). The need for supports for family caregivers is noted in the plan, but briefly and with little substance.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that failure to address issues of mental health will result in continued failure to meet fundamental needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<p>I am a co-author and now facilitator for our state plan, <strong>Conquering the Specter of Alzheimer's Disease in South Carolina</strong>, which was presented to the State Legislature on March 1, 2009. Needless to say, I have a keen interest in a national strategy to fight this disease. One of the recommendations that came out of South Carolina's task force was the involvement of the work force in supporting and assisting caregivers. Following is one of the recommendations in our plan regarding employers enabling caregivers to remain in the work force. This seems to coincide with the priorities of the national plan and represents an area not specifically addressed through the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 20</strong>. Promote and support private and public sector businesses in addressing the needs of employees who are caregivers to persons with ADRD through the use of on-site respite, support groups, or other initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Seventy percent of people with ADRD are living at home, most of whom receive unpaid help from family members<sup>[i]</sup>. One study of family and other unpaid caregivers of people with ADRD found that 57% were employed full time or part time. Of those who were employed, two-thirds said they had to go in late, leave early or take time off because of caregiving; 18% had to take a leave of absence; 13% had reduced their hours; and 8% had turned down promotions<sup>[ii]</sup>. Eight percent of caregivers in the study had quit work entirely because of caregiving. Another study of family and other unpaid caregivers of more than 2,000 older people found that caregivers of people who had Alzheimer's or other dementias without behavioral symptoms were 31% more likely than caregivers of other older people to have reduced their hours or quit work<sup>[iii]</sup>. Caregivers of people who had Alzheimer's or other dementias with behavioral symptoms were 68% more likely than caregivers of other older people to have reduced their hours or quit work<sup>[iv]</sup>.</p>

<p>I am an Occupational Therapist and specialize in Dementia Care. I have reviewed th National Alzheimer's plan and find the outline to be refreshingly comprehensive. As you and HHS move forward on the plan, please consider the important role of occuaptional therapy and the importance of providing services within a Psychosocial model and NOT a medical model.</p>
<p>I suggest the following beneftis for American seniors, as paid for without raising the debt.</p>
<ol><li>Allow for medicare to reimburse for Outpatient education and training services provided to the caregiver of someone with dementia. This training must be to meet a skilled need and can be provided within context of a small group session (2-3 caregivers). For example, as an OT, I could provide training to 3 caregivers in the bathing of patients in the moderate stages of dementia. This would be an efficient use of resources and time. Medicare must accept the fact that dementia care involves treating the dyad (patient+caregiver), not just the patient.</li>
<li>Allow for coordination of services between organizations without barriers of HIPPA (I would need to call a social worker or case manager at a hospital and freely discuss a patient's case).</li>
<li>Identify Occupational Therapy as a critically needed and stand alone provider of services to dementia patients and their caregivers.</li>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 49, after struggling to get a diagnoses from age 39. We need to better educate our doctors.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to read many of the public comments. Many referred Psychologists and Neuropsychologists that may not have been in the plan. While I think they can add a benefit to people with AD, they can also hinder diagnose, as was done to me. In my experience it delayed my diagnoses for about 10 years, not to mention the financial burden it created to our health system. Many need to be better educated on how people with AD react to the test they provide. They also need to put some merit in what their patients and caregivers may share with them. Especially if the caregiver is a RN.</p>
<p>In June 1999, I had my first full Neuropsychological Evaluation conducted by Dr. Lindsey Robinson. The summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills relatively evenly developed. Neuropsychological testing revealed moderate to severe impairments in information processing speed and sustained attention, with mild to moderate impairments in verbal learning efficiency. Short-term attention, expressive/receptive language skills, verbal and nonverbal abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were within normal limits for age. There was no evidence of clinically significant depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder which might account for the patient's cognitive deficits. The etiology of Mr. Ellenbogen's cognitive impairment is unclear as, from a neuropsychological perspective, his symptoms are nonspecific. However, the magnitude of impairment observed on objective testing, in the absence of identifiable affective disorder, does suggest the presence of some form of organic cerebral dysfunction. Further neurological evaluation recommended.</em></p>
<p>I another appointment with Dr. Lindsey Robinson on February 2001. It was frustrating dealing with these doctors because every time I had to see a new doctor or take a test, my primary doctor needed to okay it. The other frustration was that sometimes I had to wait 5 months for appointments, which was the case with this appointment. The test that I was about to retake was questionable. I was not sure my insurance would cover the procedure, so I had to jump through hoops with the doctor and my insurance company. If the test was not covered, it would cost me about $2,500.00. When you deal with these insurance companies, document the conversation for yourself and ask them to do the same. I cannot tell you how many times they tried to get out of paying, but then they checked their records and saw I had received pre-approval. They kept putting up roadblocks and I had to be in touch with them a lot, when I should have been working. It was bad enough that I had to leave work for appointments, I did not need the added aggravation from the insurance company.</p>
<p>I finally met with Dr. Lindsey Robinson. She had commented on my other doctors findings in the beginning of her report: <em>The etiology of his cognitive symptoms was felt to be multifactorial, including normal aging, alcohol consumption, and anxiety.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I saw those comments, I was very angry. She was making up her mind before even administering the test.</p>
<p>Her summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with no significant discrepancy between verbal cognitive skills and nonverbal reasoning abilities, There is no significant change in overall intellectual ability in comparison with the evaluation in June of 1999. On neuropsychological testing, Mr. Ellenbogen displays generalized psychomotor slowing and inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and memory. In comparison with the previous evaluation, a variable, inconsistent pattern of change was demonstrated, with improvements on some measures and declines on others. This pattern of performance is not suggestive of focal or lateralized organic cerebral dysfunction, and is not consistent with the presence of a progressive cognitive disorder. Rather, Mr. Ellenbogen's neuropsychological test performance suggestive of fluctuating levels of attention, concentration, and performance speed. Objective psychological screening suggest the presence of mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and an introspective, perfectionistic personality style. These psychological symptoms are most likely playing a significant role in Mr. Ellenbogen's subjective cognitive dysfunction.</em></p>
<p>She encouraged me to seek a psychiatric consultation to determine whether a trial of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication might be helpful in ameliorating my cognitive symptoms. She got me so aggravated, and she would not listen to anything my wife or I tried to tell her. She just did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>I went back to Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson, the Clinical Neuropsychologist, in January 2006. She was going to redo the neuropsychological testing. I thought it would be best to use this doctor again because she had a baseline for me and could compare my new results with the old. It would take months for the results. The other issue was that there were not many doctors, who performed this test, that were covered under my health insurance policy.</p>
<p>In June 2006, just a few weeks after my 48th birthday, Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson finally got back with the results of my testing. Her results for neuropsychological testing were as follows: <em>Background -- Previous neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001 revealed fluctuating, inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and performance speed, and symptoms consistent with anxiety and depression. Summary and recommendations -- Multiple aspects of Mr. Ellenbogen's behavior and test performance suggestive of inconsistent/incomplete effort during the evaluation. Thus, this test results described are not regarded as a valid representation of his optimal cognitive functioning. Mr. Ellenbogen's clinical presentation and test are unchanged in comparison with prior neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001. There is no evidence of progression of cognitive impairments, and Mr. Ellenbogen's developmental history and current test performance are not consistent with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any other organically-based cognitive disorder. Mr. Ellenbogen demonstrated an anxious/ obsessive personality style and some symptoms of depression. His cognitive can be most parsimoniously attributed to affective disorder and/or other motivational or psychological factors.</em></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Impression;</em></p>
<p><em>R/O Dementia (not in evidence)<br />
					R/O Anxiety Disorder, NOS<br />
					R/O Personality Disorder, NOS</em></p>
<p>Her recommendations -- <em>Mr. Ellenbogen should be reassured that thorough medical/neurological evaluation on multiple occasions has revealed no evidence of neurological cause for his cognitive symptoms. A trial of psychotropic medication could be considered to address Mr. Ellenbogen's apparent effective symptoms. He is unlikely to benefit from psychotherapy due to his reluctance to accept a non-medical explanation for his symptoms.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I met with her and read this report, I was so upset that I had made the decision to go back to her. First of all, during my testing we were not in a quiet area. Anytime I hear noise, it just throws me off. I have difficulty processing and concentrating when that occurs. There was nothing she could do to make it better. I tried very hard to be accurate during my testing and worked as quickly as I could. I tried to inform her that she was wrong in her findings, but she did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>She was so confident in her failure to diagnose me properly, that when I had reach out to her to make her aware that other Psychologists and Neuropsychologists determined that I did have Alzheimer's. She insisted on writing a letter to tell my primary doctor, that the others were wrong and she felt that her diagnosis was correct. Since that day I tried to reach out to her and gave her the opportunity to see the conclusions that 3 other doctors cane up with, but her office refused. Doctors like this will only hurt people like me. There should be a specific testing they must go through before they can test YOAD patients.</p>
<p>Maybe someone from your office can educate her. [address removed]</p>
<p>As you can see, it requires special doctors with the right training to deal with YOAD. I hope you will insure that happens.</p>
