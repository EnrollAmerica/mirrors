<p>Attached you will find a letter urging that people with Down syndrome be included in the national plan to address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia. In addition, as a parent or family member, I am aware of the need to provide special supports for caregivers, often siblings or aging parents, who assume responsibilities for the care needs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia.</p>
<p>It is also case that these individuals have special needs that may differ and require different supports than those provided to individuals in the general population. These needs have been identified by the National Task Group and Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices in an action plan it issued as part of its report: My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports", which has been submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have the need for research and population specific clinical trials identified specifically and clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as well as the care challenges they face that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports.</p>
<p>We are working with many families who are facing this very issue and the numbers are growing. As Executive Director of one of the largest Down syndrome associations in the country, and as a member of the DSAGC Health Professional Advisory Board who also serves as a consultant for the DSAGC who specializes in helping these families, we strongly urge the Council to consider the aging families who are dealing with aging children with Down syndrome who are most likely going to end up with this painful diagnosis. It is devastating diagnosis for families who have fought so hard to provide lifelong opportunities for their loved one...and then to have those opportunities taken away because of Alzheimer's disease is tragic to watch.</p>
<p>Please include us in the national study.</p>

<p>I am uncertain whether my comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (see attached) are most appropriate to be sent to you, as liaison with the Advisory Council, and/or napa@hhs.gov (representing address for public comments), as I am unclear whether there is a distinction. I believe my comments may be most appropriate and relevant for the Advisory Council and their considerations, and therefore sending to you. Please let me know if I should also send directly to napa@hhs.gov.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the March 14 Advisory Council teleconference as well as the opportunity to submit my comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and its importance for the more than 400,000 individuals with Down syndrome in the US and their families and caregivers as well as associated stakeholders. More explicit inclusion of Down syndrome as integral to the Plan, particular concerning fundamental, translational and clinical research, will be important for accelerating progress and success not only for individuals with Down syndrome, and associated very high Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and dementia, but also for the entire population that will develop or currently have Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Should you have any additional questions etc., please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Regarding Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					March, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the development of the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and for the opportunity to submit comments.</p>
<p>The Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation is a national/international 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission to stimulate and support biomedical research that will accelerate development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for children <strong>and</strong> adults with <strong>Down syndrome</strong>. The major objectives include creating new opportunities for <strong>all</strong> Individuals with Down Syndrome to: 1) Lead more independent lives; 2) Participate more successfully in schools &amp; employment; and 3) Prevent additional early cognitive decline with aging &amp; <strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Since its founding in 2004, DSRTF, through its novel research strategy and grants program, has identified and substantively supported much of the research that has led to the recent rapid and unprecedented advances in Down syndrome cognition research and the first clinical trial with a novel drug candidate to focus on as a primary indication and specifically address overcoming cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with Down syndrome by a major international pharmaceutical company, Roche.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the explicit recognition, inclusion and designation of attention to intellectual disabilities populations as unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease within Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease and for populations facing care challenges. However, this is far too limited within the overall plan; it is more than just initiatives addressing only care. As discussed further below, there is a very strong rationale to <strong>explicitly include Down syndrome</strong> in each of the strategies, and designated strategic sub-actions, comprising the National Alzheimer's Plan and resulting initiatives, and Strategy 1 involving fundamental, translational and clinical research in particular.</p>
<p>As research has documented, virtually all individuals with Down syndrome, now numbering more than 400,000 individuals in the US, develop the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40. Research has also shown that, very conservatively, at least 25% increasing to 75% or more of the individuals with Down syndrome between the ages of 40-60 develop the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and the percentage increases with age. These facts underscore the very significant and important relevance of this population as a key and explicit element to be included not only in the National Alzheimer's Plan but also in the development and implementation of all aspects of the Plan, including research (fundamental, translational, and clinical) to effectively prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease, enhancing care quality and delivery, and expanding supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given these facts, explicit and integral inclusion and consideration of Down syndrome in the Plan and associated initiatives can not only significantly address the significant number of individuals with Down syndrome but also the larger non-Down syndrome population developing or with Alzheimer's disease. This requires significant increases in awareness and rational considerations among researchers and clinicians, which can be partly addressed through explicitly including Down syndrome more prominently in the Plan as well as in resulting initiatives and increased proportional funding.</p>
<p>Given the significant size of the Down syndrome population (&gt;400,000 in the US, and up to 10-times that number worldwide) and the virtual certainty that the individuals will develop the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and ultimately the associated dementia further compromising their cognition and life, inclusion of Down syndrome, particularly in the research initiatives (fundamental, translational, and clinical) would significantly contribute important novelty, unavailable otherwise, to as well as enhance and accelerate essentially all aspects of the major objectives specified under Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 as well as Goal 2. NIH grants and funding for <strong>all</strong> of Down syndrome research have remained disproportionately very low, e.g. $20M in FY 2011. This includes a much smaller and too limited subset of research grants investigating the aspects of Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. As only one contrasting example, explicit and significant attention and funding by NIH and its Alzheimer's disease research initiatives, both basic and translational, have been targeted to so-called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, both basic and translational (see e.g., the DIAN initiative) that is much more rare and with a much smaller population. In both Down syndrome and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease myriad research has confirmed the significant involvement of the same gene, APP, and its products (The APP gene is located on human chromosome 21, the chromosome trisomic in Down syndrome, as are a number of additional genes demonstrated to be involved in mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease.). Through more detailed and sufficient investigations in the Down syndrome population, researchers can obtain invaluable insight into how and why Alzheimer's disease develops, and can compare and extend their findings to the much more common late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease as well as enhance and accelerate development of new therapeutics. The relevant trajectory to Alzheimer's disease and size of the Down syndrome population provides a strong rationale for greater recognition and explicit inclusion in the National Alzheimer's Disease Plan and resulting Alzheimer's disease fundamental, translational and clinical research initiatives.</p>
<p>Although by no means an attempt to thoroughly include detailed or exhaustive rationale and recommendations in these comments here, in addition to the suggestions and requests above with respect to more prominent and explicit integral recognition and inclusion of Down syndrome in the ultimate version of the National Alzheimer's plan, I submit the following recommendations for further consideration:</p>
<ul><li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Goal 1 as well as each of the proposed "Actions" under Strategy 1A, including Actions 1.A.1-5.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.B. including Actions 1.B.1-6. This would include not only research in animal models of Down syndrome, but with respect to human clinical studies explicit designation and inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to those clinical studies initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts. The results would be expected to be mutually informative and beneficial.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.C. including Actions 1.C.1-2. Again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success.</li>
<li>As is true for Alzheimer's disease research and development, relevant Down syndrome research is ongoing, and increasing, internationally. It will be important to coordinate with and expand relevant Down syndrome research internationally and collaboratively. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.D. including Actions 1.D.1-2.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.E. including Actions 1.E.1-3. With respect to Action 1.E.1., again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success. With respect to Action 1.E.2., inclusion of private-public collaborations and partnerships between Federal entities such as NIH and non-governmental nonprofit organizations such as DSRTF with its focus on Down syndrome cognition research will enhance productivity, accelerate significant progress and success as well as minimize duplications of efforts and resources. With respect to Action 1.E.3., the critical importance of the increasing development and very significant impact of Alzheimer's disease on individual with Down syndrome and their families and care givers underscores the importance of involvement and communication with this community and associated stakeholders.</li>
<li>As indicated above, given the particular and significant relevance and importance of and impact of Alzheimer's disease on the relatively large population of individuals with Down syndrome, their families and caregivers as well as the healthcare system, it is not sufficient to generally designate "intellectual disabilities" in only Strategy 2.H. "Down syndrome" should be explicitly included in proposed Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies.</li>
<li>Finally, based on the comments, rationale and recommendations outlined above, we would encourage and recommend that a representative from the Down syndrome community be added to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Advisory Council, as the important deliberations, priorities and implementation will have mutual benefits to science/research, clinical care, and long term care not just additionally for individuals with Down syndrome and associated Alzheimer's disease but also for the broader population and research efforts involving Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>I would be very pleased to further discuss, as may be helpful and informative, any aspects of the above concerning the importance of explicit inclusion and considerations of Down syndrome relating to Alzheimer's disease in further detail with those involved in developing the National Plan, including members of the Advisory Committee. I have registered for and plan to attend the upcoming May 14-15 NAPA/NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in Bethesda, and look forward to the opportunity for further discussion of the importance and relevance of Down syndrome for the Plan and its successful implementation as outlined above.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Alliance for Aging Research, we thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Alliance for Aging Research, <a href="http://www.agingresearch.org">http://www.agingresearch.org</a>, is a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace of medical discoveries to improve the universal experience of aging and health. Our work in Alzheimer's disease includes chairing the Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition that brings together stakeholders to accelerate development of new treatments; and as an active member of the Leaders Engaged in Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) coalition, serving as co-chair of its research and drug development workgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You and Introduction </strong></p>
<p>We would like to first thank and praise the Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its swift implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In only 14 months since President Obama signed the legislation into law, HHS has appointed the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, convened the council three times, and developed both a draft framework and draft national plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, we would like to thank you for the Obama Administration's commitment of a $50 million boost in immediate funding for Alzheimer's disease research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 and for the $80 million increase in the President's fiscal 2013 budget. The announcement about the availability of these funds marks a historic moment for the country. No previous administration has proposed a research increase specific to this dreaded disease. In addition, the initiative also includes a much-needed increase of $26 million for FY 2013 to enhance support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers as well as education for providers and the general public.</p>
<p>We praise HHS for recognizing the importance of the larger demographic shift in the U.S. aging population as a motivator for success of the National Plan, which states:</p>
<p><em>NAPA offers a historic opportunity to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given the great demographic shifts that will occur over the next 30 years, including the doubling of the population of older adults, the success of this effort is of great importance to people with AD and their family members, public policy makers, and health and social service providers. </em></p>
<p>The Alliance believes that increased investment in preventing, treating or curing chronic diseases of the aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, is perhaps the single most effective strategy in reducing national spending on healthcare. As you are aware, eighty percent of seniors have at least one major chronic condition and half have two or more. Chronic diseases associated with aging account for more than 75 percent of Medicare and other federal health expenditures. Unprecedented increases in age-related diseases as the population ages are one reason the Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on healthcare will rise to 25 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025 from 17 percent today. Simply put, our nation does not have the luxury of time to address the health research needs of this population.</p>
<p>The Alliance recognizes that fiscal restraints are required in the current economic climate, and that the Administration has already extended itself to support Alzheimer's disease funding in the National Plan. However, one of our overall comments is that <strong>funding lines must be developed and additional resources provided to adequately meet the goals of an otherwise ambitious plan</strong>. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) specifically, and NIH in general, will need a funding commitment in the billion dollar range to meet the defined 2025 goal to "prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease"; FDA will need an increase of hundreds of millions to accelerate the regulatory process and promote innovation in the development of Alzheimer's disease treatments; and other agencies from AoA to CMS and HRSA will need additional resources to meet Alzheimer's-specific objectives identified in the plan that are expected to occur in conjunction with implementation of Affordable Care Act programs. The Alliance suggests that HHS create a detailed chart of current (within the next fiscal year) expected federal/private investment in each area and costs associated with meeting each goal and strategy within the plan. Otherwise, a majority of these activities look to be unfunded mandates for federal programs with already limited resources.</p>
<p>Second, the Alliance is pleased that HHS has recognized the data gaps that exist for Alzheimer's disease and has additionally committed $1.3 million for FY 2013 to address them. HHS' use of NIA-generated, peer-reviewed, figures for Alzheimer's disease prevalence is monumental. While seemingly academic, the identification and development of reliable data is the necessary starting point for accurate needs assessment and programmatic response. <strong>Data development is a cornerstone of the plan that the Alliance believes should be integrated throughout each goal as well as remain its own goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Last, the Alliance was disappointed that this draft plan did not include the inventory conducted by the federal interagency working group. It is challenging to comment on the goals and strategies of the draft plan when the rationale behind them is not included as a resource. We understand that this was the first inventory conducted and that certain federal regulations must be met before presenting it in a clear format for the public. However, we wanted to note the issue and <strong>strongly recommend that future draft plans include the inventory to allow for more informed public comment</strong>.</p>
<p>The comments below are organized by the goals and strategies identified in the plan in specific areas where we felt the Alliance had expertise and that were not already being addressed in comments submitted by the research and drug development workgroup that the Alliance co-chairs through LEAD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The Alliance praises HHS for setting a goal of 2025 to "develop effective prevention and treatment modalities." We believe that setting this goal makes sense for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NAPA legislation expires in 2025. Goal setting is valuable for mobilizing policymakers and the advocacy community, motivating researchers and industry, and galvanizing public attention and awareness of the issue. The Alliance feels strongly that HHS and NIH should be clear with the public in particular about the state of Alzheimer's disease research to manage expectations. We hope that the upcoming May Alzheimer's Research Summit will include an explanation of this goal that will be captured by the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></em></p>
<p>The Alliance is very supportive of this particular action to "examine ways to speed up the processes for bringing pharmacological treatments to market, including: identifying and validating therapeutic targets; developing new interventions: testing efficacy and safety; and regulatory approval." In fact, the Alliance spearheaded a coalition effort, Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition, <a href="http://www.act-ad.org">http://www.act-ad.org</a>, in 2006 to accomplish similar goals. <strong>HHS should consult with ACT-AD as it moves ahead with this action</strong>.</p>
<p>ACT-AD is a coalition of nearly 50 national non-profit health professional, patient, health provider and consumer organizations seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. ACT-AD's mission is to support accelerating research for transformational therapies to potentially slow, halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Until the formation of the ACT-AD Coalition, there was no point of advocacy combining the perspectives and commitment of respected advocates for women's health, consumer interests, caregiver support groups and aging interested organizations. ACT-AD is strengthened by the diversity and credibility of those voices and is bringing that strength to bear on critical issues concerning the development, review and approval of a new generation of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Under the current regulatory environment, research being performed today cannot reach patients in time to avert this disaster. CNS drugs take, on average, 13 years from initial animal studies of a drug candidate to approval. A delay of one year negatively impacts the lives of nearly 333,000 patients and their families. While these figures underscore the urgency of seeking more effective therapeutic interventions for patients with Alzheimer's disease, there are promising treatments being tested that may slow, halt or reverse Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The ACT-AD Coalition works with urgency to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The methods the Coalition uses to conduct its important work include:</p>
<ul><li>Educating healthcare professionals, providers and other key constituencies about ways to focus the attention of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials and other decision makers about the need to expedite Alzheimer's disease treatments in the crowded landscape of those vying for consideration and action.</li>
<li>Advancing ACT-AD's profile with the Food and Drug Administration officials and other key influencers and audiences as an organization that has critical mass and strategic focus to sustain a long-term commitment to improving the regulatory review of Alzheimer's disease drugs.</li>
<li>Initiating efforts to build support for FDA reform among key Congressional leaders who influence appropriations necessary for Agency reform.</li>
<li>Developing needed research and link Alzheimer's disease expertise to the Food and Drug Administration in order to support their efforts to prioritize drug review with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary base of facts.</li>
<li>Mobilizing support and pressure upon the Food and Drug Administration from outside the agency, especially through ACT-AD member organizations and collaborations with other third-party organizations.</li>
<li>Engaging the caregiver population that continues to be overburdened and unfocused on the need for political and regulatory reform.</li>
</ul><p>The ACT-AD Coalition holds periodic meetings with its members and representatives of the Food and Drug Administration. Scientific workshop topics have included clinical meaningfulness and Phase II trial issues--and the focus is always on areas relating to an open dialogue between the Food and Drug Administration and Alzheimer's disease community to advance efforts to combat the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>Our nation faces an impending healthcare crisis as the number of older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other complex health needs increasingly outpaces the number of healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to adequately care for them. If current workforce trends do not change, we will continue to fail to ensure that every older American is able to receive high-quality care. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) April 2008 report, "Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce," calls for immediate investments in enhancing the geriatric competencies of the entire workforce, increasing the recruitment and retention of geriatric specialists and caregivers, and improving the way that care for older adults is delivered.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>First, direct-care workers provide critical support to older adults in need of long-term care, providing eight out of every ten hours of paid service delivered.<sup>2</sup> This field, which is increasing at three times the rate of other jobs within the United States economy, provides the best opportunity for caring individuals to obtain vital employment positions.<sup>3</sup> There is also a significant shortage of health professionals and direct-care workers with specialized training in geriatrics and an even greater shortage of the geriatrics faculty needed to train the entire workforce. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions programs are the <strong>only</strong> federal programs that increase the number of faculty with geriatrics expertise in a variety of disciplines and offer critically important geriatrics training to the entire healthcare workforce. Title VIII Geriatrics Nursing Workforce Development Programs are the primary source of federal funding for advanced education nursing, workforce diversity, nursing faculty loan programs, nurse education, practice and retention, comprehensive geriatric education, loan repayment, and scholarship.</p>
<p>The $6 million investment by the Administration for "provider education and outreach" will barely scratch the surface in addressing shortages in geriatric workforce and training outlined in actions under Strategy 2.A. <strong>Much more substantial investment is needed to fund the recommendations by IOM and we suggest that HHS revisit that report and the three others that came before it</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if more students enter geriatrics training, incentivizing them to stay will require loan forgiveness options. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S. 1095, the "Caring for an Aging America Act" that <strong>would amend the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) requirements to add geriatrics and gerontology to the permanent eligibility</strong>. This small change in the language governing eligibility for NHSC loans would mean that geriatrics and gerontology specialists would always be eligible for NHSC loans as opposed to the current situation which is that these geriatrics and gerontology specialists can only participate in the program if the HHS Secretary so designates it. An additional advantage is that <strong>the loan forgiveness would be fully funded through the NHSC</strong>.</p>
<p>By 2030, our nation will require 3.5 million additional healthcare professionals and direct-care workers to fulfill the growing demand for care. <strong>The National Health Care Workforce Commission, established by the Affordable Care Act, will play a central role in formulating a national strategy for bolstering the healthcare workforce in order to meet the needs of the escalating number of older Americans</strong>. There is no mention of the commission in Strategy 2A.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services </strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the use of warning signs to promote early detection by providers and patients may create confusion in the public. Warning signs for Alzheimer's disease have not been validated and are not promoted as screening instruments; however, concern has been raised that individuals experiencing cognitive deficits and their families may treat warning sign lists as a screening tool.<sup>4</sup><strong>Although warning signs are publicized by several national organizations for educational purposes, they are not a substitute for a structured screening or consultation with a primary care provider</strong>. Further, the utility of these warning signs is questionable since the individuals in whom these problems are first noticed are frequently well into a dementia course. In addition:</p>
<ul><li>Most of the warning signs may be indicative of a number of other health issues, including everything from depression (changes in mood/personality) to transient ischemic attack (problems with language/disorientation). There is often no mention that these warning signs may indicate other conditions.</li>
<li>By the time any one or more of the warning signs presents the individual may be in the early moderate/moderate stage at best so "early detection" is a misnomer.</li>
<li>Warning signs may be useful in raising public awareness about Alzheimer's disease. However, elevating warning signs to an early detection tool and then placing the onus of recognition on those with the illness and their loved ones is not sound policy--especially given that anosognosia (unawareness of a problem of cognition in oneself, usually to the point of vigorously denying the problem) is a common symptom for individuals with the disease.</li>
<li>Moreover, promoting the use of warning signs among individuals and family caregivers may serve as a disincentive to providers to learn more about proper, proactive detection methods.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes </strong></p>
<p>Behavioral issues are a main reason that psychoactive medications are administered in long-term care settings, which may result in increased falls, increased mortality and increased confusion. There has been increased focus on the use of "atypical" antipsychotic medications in particular, after FDA introduced its black box warning in 2005 and for "conventional" antipsychotics in 2008 for patients with dementia.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In May 2011 the HHS Office of the Inspector General released a report Medicare Atypical Antipsychotic Drug Claims for Elderly Nursing Home Residents," which found that over a six month period from January-June 2007, 51 percent of Medicare claims for atypical antipsychotic drugs were erroneous, amounting to $116 million.<sup>6</sup> The report found that over 726,000 of the 1.4 million atypical antipsychotic drug claims for elderly nursing home residents did not comply with Medicare reimbursement criteria. The claimed drugs were either not used for medically accepted indications as supported by the compendia or not documented as having been administered to the elderly nursing home residents. The OIG report concludes "We suggest that CMS either use its existing authority or seek new statutory authority to <em>prevent payment</em> [emphasis added] and hold nursing homes responsible for submitting claims for drugs that are not administered according to CMS's standards regarding unnecessary drug use in nursing homes."</p>
<p>The two main reasons for overuse of antipsychotics in nursing home residents with dementia are 1) understaffing and 2) lack of training. Required staff ratios have been suggested for years by nursing home advocates but Congress is reluctant to touch the issue. Training was somewhat addressed in the Affordable Care Act as part of the Nursing Home Transparency provisions, but the training section only applies to nursing assistants--not supervisors. <strong>Dementia training for nursing home staff should apply to nursing supervisors as well as assistants</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes the issue even more complicated is that there is valid use for antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. A September 2011 report, a comparative effectiveness review prepared for AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program by the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center, based at the RAND Corporation, found statistically significant evidence for risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, for the off-label indications of dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>There are provisions in the Nursing Home Reform Law, enacted in 1987, that clearly define appropriate use of psychoactive drugs, circumstances when antipsychotic drugs should be limited and provides for review of a patients drug regimen. CMS guidance to surveyors in the State Operations Manual8also encourages facilities to use non-pharmacological alternatives, identifies situations where antipsychotic medications are not indicated,9 and provides an investigative protocol for unnecessary drugs, including antipsychotic drugs. Despite these strong provisions antipsychotic drug use remains a serious concern, in part because the law, regulations, and surveyor guidance are inadequately and ineffectively enforced. <strong>Stronger enforcement of these standards would make an enormous difference</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>As HHS considers ways to strengthen its National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, the Alliance looks forward to working with you. Thank you for considering our views, and please do not hesitate to contact Alliance for Aging Research Director of Public Policy Cynthia Bens if you have any questions or would like additional information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, I am writing in support of the proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders (ADRD) that would promote an earlier diagnosis of the disease, improve strategies for long term services and supports, and accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging was created by the State Legislature in 1973 for the purpose of improving the quality of life for Illinois' senior citizens by coordinating programs and services enabling older persons to preserve their independence as long as possible. It is the single State agency authorized to receive and dispense Federal Older Americans Act funds and is mandated to provide a comprehensive coordinated service system for the State's 2.2 million older persons, giving high priority to those in greatest need. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network, caregivers and persons with Alzheimer's and related dementia.</p>
<p>According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, an estimated 222,300 individuals in Illinois are living with Alzhiemer's disease with a direct and indirect financial toll of $5.2 billion. More than 70% of those suffering from Alzheimer's disease are living at home.</p>
<p>Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease are more likely to assist care recipients with Activities of Dailiy Living (ADLs) than caregivers to other persons.<sup>(1)</sup> Caregivers often help to manage other serious medical conditions in addition to Alzheimer's, and because Alzheimer's and other dementia usually progress slowly, most caregivers spend many years in the caregiving role.<sup>(2)</sup> In 2006 the Family Caregiver Alliance and National Family Caregiver Association reported an estimated 1.2 million family caregivers in Illinois were providing 1.3 million hours of care to family members. As the baby boom generation enters the age of greatest risk for Alzheimer's, by 2025 their number in Illinois is expected to increase to over 239,000.</p>
<p>Thirteen Area Agencies on Aging and statewide service providers comprise the Aging Network in Illinois, which effectively links older persons with needed services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP), implemented through the Aging Nework, provides five basic service categories to family caregivers including: information about services; assistance in accessing services; counseling; support groups and trianing/education; respite care; and, supplemental services.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, 66,132 Illinoisans received assistance through services of the NFCSP. Additionally, 493,313 individuals received assistance through supportive and nutrition services of the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>The proposed National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders contains thoughtful recommendations which address the immediate and long-term needs of caregivers, providers and individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease. The Aging Network in Illinois is committed to providing services to Alzheimer patients, their families and caregivers through a number of programs which support the five goals of the National Plan.</p>
<ul><li>Public Education and Outreach: Through Title III-B efforts under the Older Americans Act and Title III-E programs of the National Family Caregiver Support Program the Aging Network provided education and outreach on aging issues and available resources to 6,429 individuals in FY 2011. Additionally, the Department collaborates with many professional organizations to provide education and training opportunities. Examples include the Annual Elder Rights Conference; Senior Expos; Area Agencies on Aging sponsored Lunch and Learn/Brown Bag events; Caregiver Conferences; AIRS (Alliance of Information and Referral Systems) training; the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services Older Caregiver Training.</li>
<li>Outreach to healthcare providers: Home and community-based resources are critical to ensure that persons living with Alzheimer's disease are adequately and safely cared for in their homes as long as possible and contain the cost of health care. The Illinois Department on Aging sponsors many conferences and workshops for professionals including the Community Care Program/Case Coordination Unit Annual Supervisor Conference convening supervisors from case coordination units and home care agencies; the Annual Governor's Conference on Aging and Illinois TRAID comprised of state and local law enforcement agencies and other professional organizations. The Department also promotes the use of the Administration on Aging's National Alzheimer's Call Center by caregivers and encourages referrals by AAAs and providers.</li>
<li>Expanded support for people with Alzheimer's disease and caregivers in the community: The Department has aggressively pursued funding to expand and enhance services for caregivers. In 2009 the Administration on Aging awarded the Department a three year Lifespan Respite grant which has enhanced access to and improved awareness of respite services. The Department has established a statewide Caregiver Advisory Committee which convenes regularly to discuss caregiver issues, share resources and best practices and review caregiver programs and is establishing protocol to implement and effective service delivery system through Aging and Disability Resource Centers/Coordinated Points of Entry.</li>
<li>Improved data collection and analysis: The Department works closely with the thirteen Area Agencies on Aging to collect data for NAPIS reporting as well as reviewing current caregiver assessment tools.</li>
</ul><p>In 2009, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Related Dementia State Plan - Senate Joint Resolution 43 - Report to the Governor and General Assembly." Recommendations in this report are reflected in the National Plan and include:</p>
<ul><li>Establishing adequate staffing levels and funding</li>
<li>Establishing basic and specialized education and training for persons when responsibilities make it likely they will come into contact with persons with AD and related dementias and their caregivers</li>
<li>Facilitate planning, treatment and research</li>
<li>Provide assistance to unpaid caregivers of persons with AD</li>
<li>Determine an effective system to collect data</li>
</ul><p>We must continue to examine our current capability to meet the Alzheimer's crisis and propose action to prepare for and respond to these challenges which include the development of a standardized caregiver assessment; establishment of the ADRC service delivery model; continue collaborative efforts of the Lifespan Respite Program; continue to incorporate consumer directed care service models through the National Family Caregiver Support Program; continue to collaborate with the Alzheimer's Association in Illinois; utilize Area Agencies on Aging and service providers to disseminate information and provide culturally sensitive training and materials to providers and caregivers; assist families and individuals in planning for future needs and provide updates to families, caregivers and providers regarding the latest clinical guidelines and information on how to work with people with AD; examine the capacity of public safety and law enforcement to respond to person's with Alzheimer's; examination of trends in the Alzheimer's population and needs, including assistance to persons with early stage and early on-set Alzheimer's and persons with Alzheimer's and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department on Aging and the Aging Network is committed to continue to respond in the most appropriate and effective way to this growing health problem and meet the challenge of providing service to Alzheimer's patients, their families and caregivers. The proposed National Plan is sensitive to local efforts to support caregivers and direct-care workers and offers viable proposals to support, educate and train the direct-care workforce and state aging workforces.

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association (APA), I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services, the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, and the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop and refine the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Enclosed are our APA comments in response to the draft plan released on February 22, 2012. APA is a scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with 154,000 members and affiliates. APA's mission is to advance the creation, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA is eager to collaborate with the Advisory Council, federal agencies, and other organizations in the continued planning and implementation of the National Plan. We will continue to promote the involvement of our members in this important effort and stand ready to recommend psychologists (including researchers, clinicians, and educators) with expertise in a wide array of areas that are critical to the plan's success. These areas include: cognitive aging; neuropsychological and capacity assessment; evidence-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers; implementation research, public education and social marketing; palliative care; designing culturally appropriate programs and materials; health provider education and training; integrated health and care coordination models; and dementia guideline development.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments, or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of APA's Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>American Psychological Association Comments on Draft National Plan</strong></p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) appreciates that the Draft National Plan is responsive to some of the concerns that we raised in January. In particular, we are pleased to see greater attention to clinical trials to test lifestyle interventions, including exercise and cognitive training. These interventions show promise as ways to improve cognitive health, and may in time be shown to prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The second draft's emphasis on recruiting diverse participants to clinical trials is also important.</p>
<p>The ability to image biomarkers has significantly advanced the study of Alzheimer's. What continues to be missing in the current draft is an acknowledgement of the critical role of neuropsychological testing and assessment to measure changes in cognitive performance. Real clinical benefits for those with AD depend on fully understanding how biomarkers relate to cognition and behavior. It is fundamentally important to understand why people with similar amounts of beta amyloid may have very different cognitive profiles. The National Institute on Aging and its funding partners are urged to support additional research that links the presence of biomarkers with changes in cognition and functional behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1A: Identify research priorities and milestones </em></p>
<p>APA supports the convening of a summit to help set research priorities to reach the goals articulated in the National Plan, and the additional strategies to receive broad input and refine and update research goals and priorities as the Plan is put into effect. APA also supports the convening of a workshop on non-Alzheimer's dementias, and offers assistance for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>In order to clarify the types of research being discussed, APA suggests the following wording changes - with underlined text to be added and struck-through text to be deleted: </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will expand clinical trials on pharmacologic and <s>non-pharmacologic</s> <u>behavioral</u> ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: APA prefers that behavioral studies be given their own name, and that they not be defined only by whether they include a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>"Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular, cellular, <u>and cognitive</u> mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention. "</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Certainly molecular and cellular work is vitally important. However, an 'integrated interdisciplinary basic science agenda' for Alzheimer's must also include basic cognitive and behavioral research.</p>
<p><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Identifying <u>and linking</u> <s>imaging</s> biomarkers <u>and behavioral/cognitive markers</u> in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Biomarker research is tremendously important, but it is neuropsychological and cognitive measures that enable scientists to link biomarkers to observable clinical symptoms. Biomarker research advances are leading to the ability to diagnose and track AD, but findings cannot be considered complete in the absence of behavioral data. Therefore, the two areas of research should be linked in the plan's language.</p>
<p>Current research demonstrates that neuropsychological measures function well as diagnostic, prognostic, and disease progression indicators (Blacker et al., 2007; Gomar et al., 2011; Jacobs et al., 1995; Tabert et al., 2006). Cognitive measures are critical in the practical and operational (not theoretical) level within all three recognized stages of AD -- pre-clinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia -- in recently updated diagnostic guidelines by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association. Therefore, cognitive measures hold the promise of identifying people at the highest risk of developing AD up to 20 years or more before the disease is diagnosed, and are the best measures of potential impact of interventions on disease progression. Particularly as treatments are worked into preclinical phases of AD, improvements in the sensitivity of the cognitive measures to reliable change over time is critically important.</p>
<p>Recent studies in 2010 and 2011, many using ADNI data, have shown that neuropsychological measures are more accurate, earlier predictors of progression to AD when compared to MRI, FDG-PET, and amyloid imaging (Gomar et al., 2011). There is considerable promise in broadening and improving the measurement of cognitive markers of AD. Every piece of the expansion and improvement of AD research will require good (and better) cognitive assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </em></p>
<p>"The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease includes healthcare and long-term services and supports providers such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, <u>neuropsychologists</u>, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants, who provide care at home or in long-term care facilities. These providers need accurate information about caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease including the benefits of early diagnosis and how to assist caregivers. Physicians need information on how to implement the "detection of any cognitive impairment" requirement in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit included in the Affordable Care Act. Major efforts by both VA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act, support geriatric training for physicians, nurses, <s>and other health workers."</s> <u>social workers, psychologists, dentists, pharmacists, counselors, and allied health professionals</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: We believe it is important as this plan will direct future efforts and funding in this area, that all geriatric disciplines be explicitly mentioned. Psychologists, social workers, and other health care providers play an integral role in VA interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Accordingly, they are included in the ACA expanded training provisions, and are listed on the BHPR website.</p>
<p><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools </em></p>
<p>"The Affordable Care Act created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. 'Detection of any cognitive impairment' must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment and risk for dementia," <u>and to determine the need for referral for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Neuropsychological evaluation remains a critical component of differential diagnostic methods in discriminating neurodegenerative changes from normal age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are related to psychiatric conditions or medical morbidities, and other related disorders. Neuropsychological measures are accurate, early predictors of progression to AD and provide useful information to individuals with dementia and their families regarding the functional capacities of the individual and potential impact of interventions on disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>"Most of the public is aware of Alzheimer's disease; more than 85 percent of people surveyed can identify the disease and its symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is also one of the most-feared health conditions. Yet there are widespread and significant public misperceptions about the <u>prevention</u>, diagnosis, <u>disease management</u>, and treatment." <u>In addition, there is a lack of public understanding of the differences between normal age-related cognitive change and pathological change</u>.</p>
<p><u>These misperceptions can lead both to delayed diagnosis when family members falsely attribute behavioral and memory issues to normal aging and to faulty diagnosis and harmful avoidance behaviors when families become paralyzed with concern about the stigma and decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. Both misconceptions can prevent families from obtaining needed and appropriate supports. They can also lead to inaction in adopting health promoting behaviors such as physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and refraining from smoking, which may prevent or slow any disease process</u>. "Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal because it forms the basis for advancing the subsequent goals of the National Plan. A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease will help engage stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by people with the disease and their families."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Two top tier messages of this campaign should be: 1) AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging; and 2) there are modifiable risk factors for AD (including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity) AND actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. A recent study (Barnes et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>4.A: Educate the public about <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Greater public awareness of <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease can <u>encourage individuals and</u> families to <u>participate in cognitive health promoting behaviors and</u> seek assessment, reduce isolation and misunderstanding felt by caregivers, and help link people in need to accurate information, resources and services," <u>when needed</u>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Professor, Researcher and Author comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over three decades I have worked as an educator at the University level, and therapist with individuals who have either been just diagnosed with early on-set of Alzheimer's Disease, mild- to moderate stages of the disease as well as late stage Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I have taught at Colleges and Universities across the United States as well as in many countries internationally. Being a two time Fulbright Scholar in Global Health Studies, I have dedicated my academic career to both teaching, researching and authoring creative and innovative approaches on how to best provide programming to those afflicted with this disease. I welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>In recent years, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as creative arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement programming; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, and cognitive training are recognized in small scale studies and are the basis of research information taught and practiced at the University level in career areas such as Therapeutic Recreation, Creative Arts Therapies, Movement and Dance Therapy and Art Therapy. These non-pharmacological approaches have emerged as a grassroots movement responding to an evolution of evidence, put into research and implemented in Social Adult Day Programs, Assisted living Facilities, and Long Term Nursing Facilities.</p>
<p>However small these studies, research is continuing to suggest that some individuals will slow the progression of dementia and have the potential to improve or revert back to normal memory with early interventions due to structured cognitive stimulation (Pressley, J., Trott, C. &amp; Tang, M., 2003; Chertkow, H., et al., 2001). Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that activities in the mental, physical and social domains have protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia (Flatiglioni, et al. 2004; Gilley, W., Wilson, L., Bienias, L., Bennett, A. &amp; Evans, A., 2004; Claire, L., Wilson, B., Carter, G., Roth, I. &amp; Hodges, J.,2004; Davie, J., et al., 2004). More specifically, continued active participation in life through social involvements and activities that are individualized and person centered to each individuals needs and skills have been documented to enhance feelings of self esteem, self worth and directly impact overall quality of life (Pruessner, J., Lord, C., Meaney, M. &amp; Lupien, S., 2004; Manly, J., et al., 2005; Kumara, R., et al., 2005). A National study of all research related to early stage dementia indicated that the need for psychosocial support for persons newly diagnosed should take place soon after receiving the diagnosis to prevent dropping social support networks, cognitive decline and leading to increased institutionalization rates (Brodaty, H., Gresham, M., &amp; Luscombe, G., 1997; Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2003). In a review of the literature regarding early stage AD it has been documented that multi-modal approaches have the most significant outcomes (Burgener, S., et al., 2007). The TTAP Method, a multi-modal approach has been documented in a pilot study (Alders, A. &amp; Levine Madori, L., 2010) to improve cognition in Hispanic elderly in a Social Adult Community Day Center in Buffalo, New York and in a research study with Rehabilitation Patients at Helen Hayes Hospital the method proved to increase overall feelings of self control and pain management (Levine-Madori, L., 2009).</p>
<p>Research in the area of non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care is still being ignored, and yet it continues to remain the most economically sound approach. In a data collection in 2010 on a Gero- psychiatric unit at Lyndon Oaks at Edward Hospital located in Naperville, Illinois, staff was trained in The TTAP Method. Pre- training data collection documented the unit had an average of 90 hours of aggressive interventions a month. These interventions were carried out by a Nursing Supervisor. Six months into staff implementing of thematic person-centered creative arts programming the aggressive behaviors went down to an average of 4.6 Nursing Interventions. Falls went from an average of 5 per month to 3, this statistics validate a direct healthcare savings of over $80,000.00 in just a six moth period. <a href="http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php">http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php</a> .</p>
<p>A world without Alzheimer's, might very well be a real possibility in the future. However, the current 5.4 million people who currently have the disease and the estimated 10,000 people daily diagnosed each and every day will still need daily non-pharmaceutical innovative programming, treatment and care. As an Art Therapist, Recreation Therapist and Ph.D. it is my belief that the current research agenda is narrow in scope and leaves research in the non-pharmaceutical -creative arts completely out of the discussion. For decades we as a society have poured millions of dollars into pharmaceutical research, which to date has yet to make an impact. It is my belief that it is crucial at this point in time, just as the baby boomers are starting dramatically impact the "graying of America". As you probably are aware, it is estimated by the National Association on Alzheimer 's disease, in 2011, that one of every 8 baby-boomers are predicted to have some form of cognitive impairment in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The time for researching the non-pharmaceutical approaches and putting research into practice is now! Those who have dedicated their lives to people afflicted by this disease process understand that these individuals LIVE with the disease for many years. The average person diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease now lives 15 years and must be given meaningful and person-centered daily therapeutic interventions. Without research we cannot move forward in the healthcare areas such as Art Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Music Therapy, etc. to provide research based, best practice approaches. Please know that these healthcare fields in the Creative Art Therapies, Therapeutic Recreation, and Music Therapy are in fact where daily treatment and ongoing cognitive, social, emotional and physical stimulation comes from. Research money is needed to be earmarked for these healthcare professionals and the research that they do in non- pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share thoughts and suggestions with you.</p>

<p>The American Health Care Association (AHCA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease published in <em>Federal Register</em> Volume 77, Number 37, pages 11116 - 11117 (February 24, 2012).</p>
<p>AHCA represents nearly 11,000 non-profit and proprietary facilities dedicated to continuous improvement in the delivery of professional and compassionate care provided daily by millions of caring employees to 1.5 million of our nation's frail, elderly and disabled citizens who live in long term and post-acute care facilities. We are most interested in this plan since we care for many people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. According to the <strong>AHCA Nursing Facility Patient Characteristics Report, March 2012</strong>, almost 48% of all nursing facility residents across the U.S. are identified as having some form of dementia, while the <strong>March 2012 AHCA Nursing Facility Operational Characteristics Report</strong> indicates that 71% of all special care beds in nursing facilities today are dedicated to care for persons with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>AHCA supports the national plan's guiding principles, goals, strategies and actions and believes the plan is timely, and when executed, will produce a better understanding of the disease and the prevention strategies, care and resources that will be required to care for people living with dementia. Since we are in agreement with the national plan and find it to be comprehensive, we offer only a few comments for your consideration.</p>
<p>The plan identifies that it is often difficult to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in terms of clinical presentation and diagnosis. AHCA would like to see this statement expanded to also include the importance of distinguishing undiagnosed psychiatric disease and characteristics, like behavioral symptoms, from Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI), the nation's largest mental health organization formed in 1979, the nation's mental health system has been and continues to be in crisis. NAMI grades states in their provision of mental illness (MI) services and rates the nation as a "D" (an average of all the states). Services found lacking include the number of psychiatrists, treatment services, and community-based supports -<a href="http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009">http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, David Grabowski, PhD from Harvard Medical School looked at MI and Dementia in nursing homes. Grabowski found that between 1960 and 1970, states closed and downsized psychiatric hospitals. As a result, many states were ill equipped to provide community service alternatives and nursing homes became the "de facto" treatment destination for people with MI. Grabowski cites findings indicating that in 2005, 12% of persons newly admitted to nursing homes had dementia, 19% had MI and 6% had both MI and dementia and the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) process, instituted in nursing homes with OBRA in 1987, was not effective at ensuring appropriate placement and treatment of persons with MI - <a href="http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf">http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The NAMI and Grabowski findings are concerning in that nursing home providers often admit individuals with undiagnosed MIs due to the lack of state MI services. These individuals may present with behavior problems that are often mischaracterized as symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and in some cases, represent both dementia and MI and raise important care issues that need to be addressed. Considering this, AHCA recommends that the national Alzheimer's plan, particularly Goal 1, Strategy 1.A related to research priorities, address the prevalence of undiagnosed MI in nursing homes, ways to distinguish undiagnosed MI from Alzheimer's, and best practices for treating individuals living with both dementia and MI.</p>
<p>Finally, the national plan identifies the need to monitor the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes (Goal 2, Strategy 3.D). AHCA is in agreement with the strategy's focus. One of our four priority goals as part of our Quality Initiative is for our members to safely decrease the off-label use of antipsychotics by 15% by the end of 2012. Given that many individuals admitted to nursing facilities are already on these drugs, reduction in off-label use of antipsychotics in nursing facilities will be more successful if attention is also given to reducing off-label prescribing in the hospital and in the community. It is important for all settings of care that provide services to the elderly to monitor and report their rates of off-label use of antipsychotic drugs. Expanding the scope of monitoring will help to more consistently and effectively detect and eliminate inappropriate uses of these drugs and help reduce antipsychotic drug prevalence in nursing facilities. AHCA recommends that the national plan, Action 3.D.2, be expanded to all healthcare settings.</p>
<p>AHCA welcomes the opportunity to work with HHS on future discussions and planning related to addressing Alzheimer's disease and on any further development and refinement of strategies and actions to improve and monitor care. We thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>While the Draft National Alzheimer's Plan mentions nonpharmacological treatments and initiatives for dementia, it does so in a way that enables these important initiatives to be easily sidelined through lack of funding, lack of understanding and inappropriate research.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that the unique and positive alternative paradigm of nonpharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's must be recognized. This paradigm has several key dimensions that the National Alzheimer's Plan must recognize as a legitimate treatment modality for Alzheimer's and related dementias that can significantly improve the lives of those with these conditions and can significantly reduce costs in the care and treatment of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>The following must be recognized and included in the plan if these significant care options are to be valued as they clearly need to be so the many millions of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias today and tomorrow receive the quality of life and human rights they deserve.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><em>A DIFFERENT PARADIGM<br />
							Nonpharmacological interventions represent a global paradigm of Alzheimer's treatment; much more than just individual actions such as chocolate, dolls, and environmental design. This paradigm, based on neuroscience theory, applied research, and clinical practice, has been developed by many experts over decades. If this powerful approach to dealing with dementia and reducing symptoms is to be taken seriously, the particulars, no matter how exceptional (such as museum programs for people with Alzheimer's, providing improvisational theatre, or giving chocolate), need to be taken as examplars of a larger way of thinking about Alzheimer's and dementia--a new paradigm--not as ends in themselves. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE<br />
							There is a huge cache of evidence-based knowledge demonstrating how non-pharmacological interventions reduce symptoms and improve daily lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. This research is often discounted and rejected because although it is meaningful and fits the needs of the evaluation being conducted, it does not fit a particular research model--the double blind randomized controlled trial. It is important to assess these data carefully to calculate the statistical effect sizes they represent and thus their impact on people's lives. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>METHODOLOGY AND METHODS<br />
							Much existing research is discounted by policymakers, researchers, and others because they are convinced that the only evidence worth counting is generated by double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs represent one important way to generate knowledge; but only one way. Other methodologies contribute substantially to our knowledge of nonpharmacological interventions and need to be taken seriously. It makes little sense to discredit a large body of knowledge that could immensely help policy and decision-making. The following summarizes two alternative ways to think about research methodology. </em></p>
<p><em>The RCT gold standard assumes that 1. It is the highest level of proof, no matter what the research question, 2. It is at the top of a hierarchy of methods where other methodologies are "lower" on the continuum, and 3. That statistical significance is a measure of meaningfulness of a finding. </em></p>
<p><em>The alternative gold standard for nonpharmacological and other research assumes that 1. The best methodology for any research question is the methodology that fits the question best--not any particular one, 2. There is no single continuum of methodology and no absolute hierarchy, and. 3. That effect measures are an important addition to statistical significance as a measure of a finding's "meaningfulness." </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
							Freedom to choose, getting what you want, being part of the larger society and taking part in cultural activities are human rights everyone deserves--including those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. We ought to be shocked at the limits to human rights being imposed daily on those with dementia (no chocolate and no visits to museums) rather than amazed that human rights are being respected in a few places--Arizona, or New York, or Massachusetts or wherever. </em></p>
<p><em>The World Health Organization defines the rights of all people as dignity, independence, self-fulfillment, participation and care. Respecting these for people living with Alzheimer's could well be a rallying cry for those who care about people living with this condition.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>THE WAY OUT OF THE ETHICAL DILEMMA OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS<br />
							In the name of science and further research, there is a movement taking place to diagnose Alzheimer's disease long before those being diagnosed show any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although these tests are presented as limited to research purposes, they are highly likely to be employed in everyday practice. For the millions who will receive this early diagnosis tomorrow and the millions living with this dementia diagnosis today, early diagnosis presents a major ethical dilemma: What to do with a diagnosis if no medications are available that stop the progress of the disease? The nonpharmacological paradigm and its associated interventions represent an ethical way to respond to the call for early Alzheimer's diagnosis since they offer a clear solution to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. </em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>For these reasons, we urge that an expert and champion of nonpharmacological approaches and treatments for dementia be appointed to generate research, direct information gathering and otherwise serve the needs of those with dementia today employing nonpharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and others administering research programs for dementia to include on an equal basis in all research, both nonpharmacological treatments and pharmacological ones. By nonpharmacological "treatments" we mean all health related activities that research has demonstrated have positive behavioral and health outcomes. These include, among others: engaging activity, exercise, targeted nutrition, music, visual arts, film, drama, museums, an appropriately designed and stimulating environment, memory books, high-touch end of life care, external written cueing, information technology, training family and formal caregivers, counseling, meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, poetry, storytelling, pets, and even chocolate.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and those administering Alzheimer's-focused research programs and Alzheimer's-focused intervention strategies to develop and make explicit key performance indicators suited to nonpharmacological interventions. We also urge them to include in research protocols all evaluation methods and methodologies suited to studying the effects of real-world applications of nonpharmacological treatments. We urge that all research involving treatment of dementia, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, include reporting the clinical significance of effects produced by treatments, as well as statistical significance.</p>

<p>The Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City represents 1200 families in 37 counties in Kansas and Missouri who are all caring for a loved one with Down syndrome. Many of our parents are gravely concerned about their child, teen or adult's future and the strong likelihood that they will develop dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I am writing to urge the Advisory Council to ensure that the population of people with Down syndrome (Ds) is specifically identified in the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Currently, this group of individuals, known to be at high risk of developing Alzheimer's and dementia, is given a fleeting reference in the Draft Plan. This omission must be rectified. We are aware that there is a lot of corollary research going on between Alzheimer's and Down syndrome and feel that more attention should be paid to this to ensure a bright future for both populations of people.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the Alzheimer disease process and develop early identification and other practices to treat this devastating disease which often affects individuals with DS early, research is urgently needed. Research of this type will benefit the general population as well as individuals with Down syndrome and those thousands with DS at risk for developing dementia. In addition, as a parent or family member, I am aware of the need to provide special supports for caregivers, often siblings or aging parents, who assume responsibilities for the care needs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia.</p>
<p>It is also case that these individuals have special needs that may differ and require different supports than those provided to individuals in the general population. These needs have been identified by the National Task Group and Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices in an action plan it issued as part of its report: <strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports"</em></strong>,which has been submitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome and their families deserve to have research and population specific clinical trials identified clearly as necessary actions in the final National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. They face many challenges that require increased awareness, early recognition and supports. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is not complete unless it fully addresses the Down syndrome population as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of this request!</p>

<p>The Arc is a membership organization of over 700 state and local chapters made up of people with intellectual, developmental and other disabilities, their families, friends, interested citizens and professionals. The Arc has represented individuals with the most significant disabilities for over 60 years.</p>
<p>The Arc is particularly interested in the Council's Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease since the disease has special significance for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Arc was pleased that the draft plan made reference to people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Strategy 2.H. However, we believe that the interests of people with ID should be infused throughout the plan rather than addressed in just two bullet points.</p>
<p>The Arc endorses the comments submitted to the Council by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (ntg). Each of the numerous immediate, near-term, and long-term recommendations for priority actions outlined in the draft plan pertains to individuals with (ID). The needs of people with ID apply to all areas addressed in the draft plan - research, early identification, training of practitioners, support for family caregivers, community-based supports and services, and data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>People with ID are living longer and the number of individuals who have Alzheimer's disease and ID likely will increase. It is incumbent on the Advisory Council to ensure that our nation's public health system is prepared.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering our input. Please contact The Arc if we may provide additional information.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS) is a professional organization comprising the directors of state agencies serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The Association assists state IDD agency officials respond to emerging state and federal policy issues that that affect their efforts to ensure the delivery of services and supports to individuals with IDD in their respective states and jurisdictions. Association staff provide member state agencies with extensive technical assistance on a wide range of system and program related issues, in-depth analyses of Medicaid and other federal statutory and regulatory policies affecting people with IDD, and cutting edge information on state-of-the-art programs and service delivery practices. NASDDDS collaborates closely with the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD) and the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG) to improve health and healthcare of people with IDD nationwide.</p>
<p>State IDD service delivery systems are large with total annual state and federal expenditures in excess of $53 billion. Data reported by the University of Minnesota Research and Training Center on Community Living reveal that over 1,000,000 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy and related conditions received publicly financed residential supports through Medicaid and other state/federally funded programs. The majority of these individuals, approximately 57% live with their families, receiving the supports that they need at home, at work and in a variety of in day programs in the community. Of the approximately 440,000 remaining individuals, about 72% live in local group homes or other neighborhood settings of less than 6 persons. Fewer than 28% reside in large state and privately operated institutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this correspondence is to provide feedback to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services regarding the <em>Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. We are pleased that the Draft Plan specifically identifies people with intellectual disabilities in Strategy 2.H as a group of Americans who are at exceptionally high risk for contracting Alzheimer's disease. Including people with IDD in the report recognizes their particular vulnerability to these conditions and suggests the challenges that publicly financed systems of support will need to meet in the very near future. We believe, however, that the report does not go far enough in addressing the specific issues identified by NASDDDS member state agencies and articulated by a national report prepared by NTG entitled, <em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em>, and the related <em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em>. Our specific concerns and suggestions include the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 1</em>. The relationship between the presence of Down Syndrome and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not given proper focus in research and practice recommendations. </strong></p>
<p>Goal 1 of the Draft Plan highlights research but does not reference the need for targeted examination and analysis of the etiology and course of dementia for people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Sustained research in this area is clearly warranted to better understand the course and treatment of the disease and to inform and hopefully improve public policy in this area. We believe that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will also benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, people with Down syndrome demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. It should be emphasized that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that Goal 1 of the Draft Plan emphasize the need for focused basic and treatment research addressing the conditions and support needs of people with Down syndrome at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 2</em>. Addressing the specialized programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS agrees with the observations and recommendations of the NTG that the Council revise the Draft Plan to recognize the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). And that the discussion of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities be mentioned earlier on in this section to make it clear that the strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. It is important that the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same manner as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Furthermore, we believe that it is important that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only address improvements of care for this specific population, but also, are designed to increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that:</p>
<ul><li>The Draft Plan and any resulting guidelines produced include reference to the special circumstances and challenges involved in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities, and that this acknowledgement be placed earlier in the second section so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.B the need for specialized screening instruments that are designed and normed for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The administrative screening tool currently under development by the NTG will have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population that are not normed for use by people with cognitive disabilities.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.E the need for long-term 'dementia capable' services and supports to be offered in small community settings rather than institutional facilities, consistent with the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this small group home model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Issue 3</em>. Need to address the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities. </strong></p>
<p>As noted above, the majority, over 57%, of all people with IDD receiving publicly financed support reside in the home of a family member. The age of family caregivers, like the average age of the U.S. population in general is growing older however, and these caregivers are now themselves needing support. Tragically, the availability of services has not kept pace with the demand for support. Plummeting state budgets and reductions in Medicaid and state-funded supports have expanded waiting lists and placed a greater burden on families with relatives in need of personal care and assistance. The ability to provide quality care to people with IDD who are aging both now and in the future depends on the ability of state and federal service delivery systems to support the capacity of families to furnish needed long term assistance.</p>
<p>The majority of adults with Down Syndrome and other intellectual disabilities need assistance in decision making and consent. Adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs and consideration must be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that the Draft Plan address the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities, (see Strategy 3.C.1)</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 4</em>. Need to expand public education activities to include individuals with IDD and their families. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS believes that Goal 4 be expanded to ensure that the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities are specifically addressed by public education campaigns and to improve coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector. State IDD agencies are instrumental in organizing, managing and delivering services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. It is essential that these state agencies be included in public education efforts and that education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. Aggressive education campaigns addressing the nature of intellectual disabilities and the needs of individuals with IDD should be targeted to universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p>NASDDDS member state agencies furnish a wide array of publicly financed services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. As the age of the population increases, state service delivery systems are working to develop effective strategies for meeting the needs of people with IDD in a way that allows them to age in place and remain a part of their families and communities. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's is an important step forward. We appreciate the work and recommendations of the Advisory Council, not only for the population in general, but particularly for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are especially vulnerable to this condition. NASDDDS gratefully acknowledges the work on this issue by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices and their assistance in forming the recommendations of this Association.</p>

<p>As younger populations become increasingly urban and concentrated, persons more likely to have Alzheimer's or related dementia, become stranded in rural communities without adequate resources or family to assist them as the disease progresses. As jobs become scarce in rural communities, children of the baby boomers have moved where there are better job prospects leaving their parents alone. The community supports simply are not adequate in rural communities to address the specific needs of persons with dementia who have no informal primary caregiver's. Many of these people will end up in nursing facilities, that are ill-equipped to handle the specific care needs of an Alzheimer's patient. Nursing homes are for skilled care; however, Alzheimer's patients frequently do not need skilled care (for much of the disease progression), they simply need supervision, social stimulation, and help with minimal ADL's and IADL's. Nursing facilities have problems handling the behavior of Alzheimer's patients, because they are frequently mobile and cause disturbances with other patients. As a result nursing facilities are reluctant to accept patients with Alzheimer's disease early in disease progression. <strong>The addition of Alzheimer's dementia specific units to nursing facilities, especially in rural communities, would alleviate some of this problem. The staffing would be smaller, and the cost per day to medicare/Medicaid could be reduced as a result.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, for informal caregivers that do live in rural communities, support groups, educational opportunities, and training are absent. In addition, broadband internet is also difficult to obtain do inadequate infrastructure, leaving the caregiver unable to obtain information. The stress of caregiving combined with isolation shortens the amount of time an informal caregiver can increase the chance the persons are placed in nursing facilities for lack of another option. <strong>Providing community training through religious institutions, civic organizations, and other groups would allow for wide dispersal of accurate information, as well as the infrastructure in rural communities, improving early diagnosis and extending the amount of time a person can stay at home with a caregiver by reducing their stress through knowledge and resources.</strong> One way of accomplishing this is to certify persons at the AAAs or County Health Departments to recruit and train volunteers to provide outreach and educational events in their communities.</p>
<p>Another component of stress reduction is respite support. Caregiver's of persons with Alzheimer's or related diseases care for their loved ones for long periods of time. The time spent away from work, church, and family can become taxing and frequent breaks are needed. As there is increased demand for respite, and in the absence of increased funding for flexible respite support one of two options is available: 1) reduce the amount of respite per caregiver or 2) maintain lengthy waiting lists. Both options fail. At some point, respite is ineffective if it is infrequent and for very brief periods of time. If the caregiver waits too long without a break on a waiting list for respite, the caregiver will give up before the programs can provide assistance. <strong>The solution is to increase funding for respite supports through the AAAs, V.A., as well as introduce a income needs based component to respite support programs eligibility requirements.</strong> People that are wealthy ought to pay for their respite, or prove they have paid x amount before they can gain access to subsidized respite support each year. The reach of the programs would extend to those least likely to take a break, because they are unable to afford it.</p>

<p>There are numerous improvements in the draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease from the initial framework plan. Additional areas of the plan still need strengthening and improvement. CCAL appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to help strengthen the draft plan. The comments follow.</p>
<p><strong>General </strong></p>
<ul><li>CCAL suggests that the plan include the words "other dementias" and be known as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias. The terms "Alzheimer's" and "dementia" are often used interchangeably. Many internists and family practice physicians (among others in the health care field), for example, are still not well educated about assessing and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and use the general term "dementia" to explain cognitive decline to patients and their families. The addition of the terminology "other dementia" is more inclusionary and desirable.</li>
<li>Person-centered care is the widely recognized gold standard of services and supports for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PWD) (Alzheimer's Association, 2006; Edvardsson, et al, 2010). It is a foundational aspect of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The draft plan is silent about person-centered care. CCAL suggests that the plan integrate the philosophy and orientation to person-centered care throughout the plan.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Challenges Section</strong> (page 4)</p>
<ul><li>Notably missing as a national challenge is the over prescription and utilization of antipsychotic medications as a first line of management for behavioral challenges experienced by PWDs. The medical community as well as the formal and informal caregiver communities need to be educated about non-pharmacologic approaches to such behavioral challenges as agitation. Medications should be used only if and when non-pharmacologic approaches have not been effective. There is currently a dearth of readily accessible information about recommended non-pharmacologic approaches and practices.</li>
<li>Also missing as a national challenge is recognition that the quality of programs and services for PWDs who reside in residential long-term care (assisted living, nursing homes) across the nation continues to be uneven and often less than optimal. There is no national focus on or effort to address quality for these long-term care programs and services despite the fact that the number of people living with dementia will increase over fifty percent by 2030.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Plan's Three Guiding Principles</strong> (page 5)</p>
<ul><li>CCAL applauds the second Guiding Principle that supports public-private partnerships. We recommend that the detail for this principle be expanded to specifically include dementia experts who represent the practice, policy, and research sectors. All too often senior executives are included on advisory panels solely because of their positions. Unfortunately they often lack actual dementia expertise and experience. It is vitally important that the national plan be developed, planned, and implemented by a diverse group of dementia experts who can provide "face validity" both to the plan and the process of its development and implementation.</li>

<p><em>This letter is very similar to my oral testimony (a few corrected typos and better words)--except for my adding a new paragraph at the beginning--to respond more fully to a public comment that preceded mine:</em></p>
<p>A person (Michael Ellenbogen?) who currently suffers from mild Alzheimer's dementia concluded his comments by recommending the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services consider the "right-to-die" option. He thus implied that Physician-Assisted Dying could be an option for patients who suffer from dementia. Because of time limitations, I could only disagree briefly by saying that Physician-Assisted Dying will neither help nor is needed. I now explain more: (1) Why would Physician-Assisted Dying NOT help? Where Physician-Assisted Dying is legal, the law requires patients be of "sound mind" when they ask their physician to write a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Yet dementia patients lose the mental capacity to make medical decisions early in the course of this progressive disease. Thus for dementia patients, Physician-Assisted Dying would compound their tragedy with <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong>. This is because dementia patients can have much good life after they lose capacity--and they can expect more, with further research--so I and many others consider <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong> an act that violates the <strong><em>principle that life is precious</em></strong>. (2) Why is Physician-Assisted Dying NOT needed? Because Living Will forms and the discussions they provoke can be both moral and effective. Combined with other clinical and strategic forms, diligent Advance Care Planning can give people peace of mind, whether they are still well or in the early stage of dementia. They need not worry about being forced to linger for months to years by enduring the huge burdens and suffering that characterize Advanced Dementia. Instead, they can feel confident that others <strong><em>will honor their Known Wishes</em></strong> after they lose the ability to speak for themselves.</p>
<p><em>Here is my original comment:</em></p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is most urgent, <strong>most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend that their patients/clients complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most urgent</strong>? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The reality of the huge, increasing epidemic of patients whose lives will end as they suffer from Alzheimer's disease makes Advance Care Planning even more urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most important</strong>? Because patients can linger in the terminal stage of Alzheimer's Dementia for several years. The relentless course of their disease may frustrate the best efforts of their clinicians, their caregivers and their loved ones. The multiple burdens on others are well known. For example, more than one-third of Alzheimer's caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many who have lost the ability to complain and whose behavior may be atypical, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most challenging</strong>? Unlike other terminal illnesses, often there are no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." They may believe: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. Then, I'll be trapped in a condition I loathe so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only compound the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients effective advance care planning so they can feel confident they can choose to avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then, many will ironically choose to live as long and as well as possible--and benefit from improvements in the medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning for Advanced Dementia needs research funding to develop and to implement--even if other researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. We know that changes in the brains of dementia patients begin one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. We also know it takes many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and to adopt a policy to implement widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers predicted to get dementia are still likely to become demented. Even if a new drug were available today, patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia. Most importantly, when they do reach the advanced stage of dementia, these patients will then have only their Advance Directives on which they can rely, to control <em>how long, and how much, they must suffer</em>before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we must thus fund research programs that will: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend their clients and patients have the discussions and complete the forms...now, while they still can.</p>

<p>My father is the third person I know to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. First was my uncle who passed away in 2005 and then my aunt or father's sister who, although 6 years younger has had it for over two years now.</p>
<p>The impact of this illness on the family is devastating. There is no one place to go for help or all the information you need. It takes a village to handle an aggressive, geriatric Alzheimer's family member. As a caregiver one needs to find out as much as possible as quickly as possible to get the help needed for a loved one. Nobody tells you all the challenges you will have and the financial impact it has on the family as well.</p>
<p>My father was normally an intelligent man, very good with mathematics, science and spoke English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Now we see him unable to handle his finances, becoming increasingly aggressive, suffering from delusions and hallucinations regarding our mother who he has been married to for 62 years.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that a mental healthcare power of attorney was not signed since the lawyers don't mention that when you go to get your will and other papers in order, we had to apply for emergency guardianship to get my father admitted to a level one psychiatric facility. After he is there for three weeks and thoroughly evaluated we are told he cannot come home due to delusions regarding our mother. Now we have to find someplace for him and try to find resources to help us. Unfortunately we end up putting him in a group home which we think is the right thing since it is similar to his home and the advice we get from social workers as well as companies such as Care Patrol, that have familiarity with this illness. Since we have no experience we follow the guidance of these "professionals." Unfortunately in our case perhaps also due to the stressfulness of the situation we did not make the right decision. The home was nice but the caregiver, although a nurse, was not there most of the time, and the other caregivers were Pilipino and did not understand English very well.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse when my brother goes to visit my father and he is in bed at 7:30 since the caregivers don't seem to want to be bothered with the patients. When he arrives my father gets up from bed and falls and the door is locked and the caregivers can't seem to figure out how to get the door opened. My brother finally does and dad is on the floor. The caregivers just leave the area and my brother and his son help my father get back into the bed. My father seems to be in a drug stupor and his eyes roll back in his head. I get a frantic call from my brother and call the hospice since he was on palliative care and ask them to send a nurse immediately since the nurse who owns the group home is not there. I also leave an urgent message for her, which is never returned. I wait and then call for the nurse at the hospice that is on call to find out that she was denied entry into the home by the caregivers who told her he was sleeping and to come back the next day. When I confront the owner of the home the following morning she insists that she called me even though there is no record on my answering machine or caller id on the home or cell phones. Then she also indicates that her mother told her that nobody came to the door from the hospice, which was an outright lie. I immediately started looking for another facility but it was difficult since they are all extremely expensive and my mother is alive and living with physical disabilities at home and all of my father's social security, pension and VA benefits (which I applied for since he was a WWII veteran) have to go in their entirety to his care and we still fall short.</p>
<p>During the time I looked for a facility I asked the group home owner not to transport my father anywhere since there was an issue when we brought him home for lunch prior to that. I had met him at a follow-up appointment with his neurologist and she said we could try to bring him home to see how it went. The first time we tried it he seemed ok but it was after an appointment for a vision test and he refused to get in the car unless we took him home. On that occasion, he managed to get his checkbook which we later found out about since we could not locate it to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The following week he had a dentist appointment due to periodontal disease which we needed to attend to. After that appointment , when we brought him home, he became very agitated and pulled a knife out of a drawer, which usually had only papers(so we can only imagine he had placed it there the week before, since we did not). He sat down and said he was not going back to the group home or as he called it, a jail. Then he said he would kill my husband if he ever saw him again since he was the one who, with my sister, brought him to the hospital. I asked him to return the knife and he took it and put it under some papers behind him. This wasn't a small knife it was a large carving knife. I asked for it back but he refused and then went out back and started cutting plants with it and ended up coming in the house without it. He had hidden it. I sent my sister out to retrieve it and she found it in a bucket outside. I took that knife and the rest that were in the house and put them in the trunk of my car. While I did that he went in the back yard and left from the gate on the side and was halfway down the block on foot. I ran to catch up with him and my sister called the police since we were very concerned and needed to get him back to the group home. When the police came he told them he would go back with us and when they left and we were a few blocks away he lunged over the back seat and grabbed my steering wheel and tried ripping the keys out of my ignition and then grabbed the gear shifter to get the car out of gear. I immediately jammed on the breaks and told my sister, who was sitting next to me, to call 911 and that is when he tried to grab the phone from her. I told him I would go back to the house and proceeded slowly to give the policemen a chance to get there. I went past the house and he became agitated and tried getting out of the car but could not since the child locks were on the doors. Unfortunately I forgot the window locks and he was able to open the window and got his body out up to his hips. I had to stop the car and get his feet back in. This is 5'8" man who weighs 158 lbs. I am only 5'3" and weigh 130. This time four police cars came and the officer ended up having to put my father in his squad car and take him back to the home.</p>
<p>Despite the incident that happened and the fact that the group home owner knew about what happened and was told not to take him out, her husband took my father to the bank a couple of weeks later and the bank rep called my mother and then me since my father was requesting his social security number to take out money.</p>
<p>When I finally found a decent place for my father that specializes in Alzheimer's and dementia care, the group home was very rude and unprofessional with the nurse who came to assess him and asked them in front of my father if they were going to take him to a psychiatric facility. So in addition to all the stress now we had to deal with a group home that was manipulating him so he would not leave. He was also writing them checks, which I got back, but we closed the account to keep anyone from taking advantage of him. He had promised money to them, wrote checks to his attorney who was appointed by the court and was promising thousands to the staff and doctors in the hospital where he was assessed.</p>
<p>On top of everything we ended up getting calls from Elder abuse since the owner of the home was apparently upset that we were taking him out and kept arguing that he wasn't ill despite the medical records from a neurologist and psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Our family has been going through hell. On top of all this there was a tremendous amount of paperwork to get VA benefits, get medications and other medical issues taken care of and the legal expenses for guardianship are bleeding my parent's dry. The emotional impact on our mother and the rest of us has been awful as well.</p>
<p>I tell you all this so you can see what it is like since none of us ever imagined how awful this would be. I don't think anyone knows what it is like until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Waiting until 2025 is too late. In my visits to many facilities I have seen people in their 40's and 50's with the disease and it will only get worse as the baby boomers age. With twice as many of them as their parent's generation we are in for a healthcare meltdown if something isn't put in place soon. We need to do something now. I am sure we are not the only family going through this.</p>
<p>There should be more research into different modalities (allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, etc.) to address this illness. I have read that there are studies being done regarding a cancer medication that is on the market that reduces the amyloid plaque in the brain. This is the website: <a href="http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html">http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html</a>.</p>
<p>I have also read about a possible treatment or preventative in raw coconut oil by a doctor who used it on her spouse: <a href="http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf">http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf</a>. Perhaps the cure or prevention lies in a combination of different modalities and all should be considered.</p>
<p>Families need more financial assistance and better resources where they can find all or most of the information needed with respect to legal, medical and assisted living resources as well as support groups to help families get the assistance they need as quickly as possible. Most of what is out there now is just "you are on your own" looking though websites in the midst of a crisis trying to find the help and guidance you need or other families at support groups trying to help each other. When a family is in constant crisis they need as much assistance/guidance as quickly as possible to help them navigate the system of care so they can make the right decisions for their loved one.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the findings but it must also be noted that some co-occurring chronic conditions such as sleep apnea (<a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021">http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021</a>) hearing loss (<a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study</a>) and periodontal disease (<a href="http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html">http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html</a>)should also be included in annual geriatric screenings since they can be directly linked to causing dementia and may be overlooked. In addition something should be put in place regarding hearing loss and the prohibitive cost of hearing aids. Perhaps insurance companies can increase fees by a few dollars a month on their premiums to include some coverage for hearing aids. Everyone is impacted by hearing loss of a senior citizen: family, motorists who drive on the roads along with them, and anyone who the hearing impaired interact with. Since hearing loss can be linked to dementia making hearing aids more affordable through some sort of coverage could help in part, to address this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone directly related to the care of a patient with dementia or Alzheimer's and affiliated with a medical facility, assisted living, or group home should need to be certified to care for a patient with this illness and display that certification where it is visible to family who are looking for care for their family member. There are people who claim to know how to handle patient s with this illness, yet do not, and tend to take advantage of the family as well as the person with the illness.</p>
<p>There should be clear guidelines in place as to what the group homes can and cannot do such as taking a dementia patient to the bank to take out money. I bring this up since this happened with my father.</p>
<p>Medical assessments in the home would help greatly as well since it can be impossible to get a dementia patient to the doctor or hospital unless you have a mental health care power of attorney. If a patient is hospitalized and determined to have dementia, a mental health care power of attorney should automatically be granted without the family having to dish out thousands of dollars to an attorney when the person has received a neurological and psychological evaluation by qualified physicians. This would save the families of these patients thousands of dollars which can be used for their care. A regular health care power of attorney is insufficient since we were told that Alzheimer's and dementia are considered physical illnesses with psychological manifestations. Without a mental health care power of attorney the family has to file for emergency guardianship and then permanent guardianship which can cost upwards of $20,000. This is a progressive disease with no known cure at this point. It is ridiculous to penalize an already suffering family to have to deplete their savings when their loved one is only going to progress in mental deterioration and obviously needs a guardian. Many times they feel that they are not ill and will continue to fight and deplete their funds further until they end up on ACCHHS (Medicaid), which in turn just depletes the government's funds further. If this is a necessity perhaps some cost containment should be put in place so families aren't hurt financially by exorbitant legal fees.</p>
<p>Another issue is medication. The VA indicates it can help with the cost of medication but you have to bring the patient into their facility. Once they are in a memory care facility they are not always amenable to being transported so it would be of great help to have a VA rep come to the patient facility to assess them for the medication benefits or just to have the paperwork from the doctor diagnoses serve as proof that the person needs the medication and provide it and delivery at no cost to the veteran.</p>
<p>The facility that my father is currently in provides dental care via mobile dentistry. It would also be beneficial to have the same with respect to mobile hearing units to help many of the residents in these facilities to get the hearing assessments and hearing aid cleaning, hearing aids, wax removal, etc. to ensure that they can hear effectively. Mobile vision care would also be a plus to ensure that the patients are seeing well or are not developing illnesses of the eye.</p>
<p>Finally decent memory care facilities are very expensive (the one our father is now at costs $4,338/mo.) and that it would help greatly to have some sort of coverage to help as the only thing available is long term care insurance which many people do not have and once you are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is no longer an option.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these suggestions into consideration in your National Plan. After going through all of this first hand I can tell you that these changes are greatly needed and would help all the families out there who are going through all of these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should have Address the Mental Health Needs of People with Dementia and their caregivers in its ambitious plan to address Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the draft plan does not provide adequate attention to mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Dementia frequently co-occurs with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems. Recognizing and treating these conditions plays a vital role in improving patients' cognitive functioning as well as the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.</p>

<p>I have just two comments on the National Alzheimer's Plan which is mostly nice sounding rhetoric that I hope helps with this devastating disease.</p>
<p>First, Goal 1 (an effective treatment by 2025) just seems to me arbitrary and unrealistically optimistic. Of course that would be wonderful but as a physician specializing in geriatrics and Alzheimer's I see little hope of this being accomplished in the foreseeable future or perhaps ever. How will this be done by 2025 when there are no significantly effective drugs on the market at this time -- this is only 13 years away and the drug development/approval process takes many years. Hopefully the research summits proposed will help. $50-80 million in new funding seems a pittance that can't possibly make a significant difference. We have had a "war on cancer" with much higher rates of funding for about 40-50 years now with some modest positive results but certainly no cure for cancer.</p>
<p>Second, in my opinion, Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes, has no place in this report. Most of the other items in this report are positive, optimistic goals. This is a narrow and arguable negative. In my opinion again as an experienced geriatrician and long term care physician, I feel the issue of antipsychotics in nursing homes is overblown and not significant enough to be a major national priority. Inappropriate use of medications is one thing that of course must be minimized, though what is appropriate is highly individualized and subjective. However the "off-label" use being considered inherently inappropriate or fraudulent is completely wrong. Physicians and nursing homes are already extensively educated and regulated on this issue. All drugs are commonly and legally used for many "off-label" scenarios and there is nothing wrong with that if the medical judgement is reasonable and the patient benefits. Unfortunately Alzheimer's patients often have uncontrollable anxiety and agitation and until a better therapy comes along, antipsychotics are often the only answer. "Conflicts of interest" among pharmacists and physicians have NOTHING to do with this issue. Clinicians simply often have no better solution for dementia related psychosis and agitation at this time. I am an active member of the American Medical Directors Association and vehemently disagree with their their "politically correct" approach to this difficult issue (they have gone along with government suggestions to more vigorously educate and crack down on physicians and nursing homes).</p>
<p>Perhaps a brief mention of better treatments for behavioral and psychological symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms and "cure" would be appropriate under goal 1. Otherwise I think this entire paragraph 3D2 is inappropriate in this report and should be completely deleted.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>From: <strong>Helen Matheny</strong></p>
<p>For your information, attached is the first draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. As a non federal member of the national Alzheimer's Disease Advisory Council I encourage each of you to review the draft and provide comments. Your perspective as a physician is critically important. HHS is seeking input on the draft National Plan through March 30, 2012. Please send your comments to napa@hhs.gov. Also, please feel free to copy me. I serve on the Council's Clinical Care Subcommittee and would greatly value your suggestions. I expect the second draft of the plan to be available mid-April.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>My sister died from Alzheimer's Disease on Oct. 5, 2011. My sister had Down syndrome.</p>
<p>The proposed plan fleetingly mentions "intellectual disabilities," which is woefully inadequate to address that fact that people with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of Alzheimer's Disease than the general population.</p>
<p>"Intellectual disabilities" must be replaced with Down Syndrome since it is these people who experience it at such a high rate at this time. "Down syndrome and other Intellectual disabilities" would be an acceptable term.</p>

<p>The suffering of people with Alzheimer's Disease and their family caregivers is invariably compounded by depression and anxiety. These are among the most devastating daily effects of the disease, undermining the quality of life of both caregivers and patients and limiting their ability to contribute to society in a meaningful and economically viable way. Any effort to improve the management of the disease should therefore include a program of psychological intervention as well as medical research and therapy.</p>

<p>Please address the mental health issues to go along with Alzheimer's Disease. My mother-in-law currently has this disease and suffers from depression and anxiety due to the frustrations that she feels in not remembering things. It is only getting worse as the disease progresses. This is a common issue. Currently she is in a skilled nursing facility because her husband passed away several years ago. He had been her caretaker. This disease takes a great toll on anyone who keeps their loved ones in their home, because constant vigilance is needed on a regular basis. This isolates the caregiver as well as the one suffering from Alzheimer's. This can lead to depression for the caregiver. Please address the mental health aspects that accompany this disease in developing your plan regarding Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>The California Mental Health Planning Council (CMHPC) is mandated by federal and state statute to advocate for children with serious emotional disturbances and adults and older adults with serious mental illness, to provide oversight and accountability for the public mental health system, to advise the Administration and the Legislature on priority issues, and to participate in statewide planning. With passage of the Mental Health Services Act, the Planning Council also has responsibilities related to workforce development.</p>
<p>One of the Systems of Care Committees that support the Planning Council is the Older Adult Committee (OAC). At our quarterly meeting that took place in San Diego, CA January 18-20, 2012, the OAC discussed the problems counties are experiencing in regard to providing older adults who have mental health diagnosis integrated care when they begin to display cognitive problems associated with the onset of dementia/Alzheimer's disease. We are concerned that as their cognitive abilities decline, their level of care will suffer. Full integration of care is what we feel they deserve. Older adults with mental illness dealing with yet another serious health issue deserve our support.</p>
<p>The OAC strongly believes that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must address the mental health needs of people with dementia/Alzheimer's disease. As the final plan is completed, we urge you to address the mental health needs of people with dementia/Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive issues as well as their caregivers who also deserve our attention. By recognizing and treating all these conditions we will improve the functioning of our patients as well as improving the quality of life for them and their caregivers.</p>

<p>Please see below for my feedback on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. I am a gerontological clinical social worker with over ten years experience in the field of dementia care. I was formerly the Director of Social Services at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, and now I am a doctoral candidate who teaches and conducts research on dementia care at Columbia University School of Social Work.</p>
<p>Congratulations on creating such a progressive plan of action. I hope that my feedback is of value. I would be delighted to get involved in any of the efforts related to finalizing this national plan or taking action on any of the activities outlined within the plan. Please contact me with any questions, comments, or concerns.</p>
<p>Positive Feedback:</p>
<ul><li>The plan is overwhelmingly comprehensive in breadth of scope and depth of detail.</li>
<li>The lists of challenges and guiding principles for the national plan are thoughtfully crafted and easily justified.</li>
<li>This plan looks to make substantial achievements toward fulfilling the objectives of NAPA with both immediate and long-range potential benefits to our citizens.</li>
<li>The inclusion of diverse stakeholders' input, as well as plans to coordinate efforts across federal agencies, shows dedication to setting realistic priorities and working toward meaningful outcomes.</li>
</ul><p>Constructive Criticism:</p>
<p>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</p>
<ul><li>The professions identified in this Action Statement are surely appropriate targets of the relevant activities, but the exclusion of the social work profession is a major oversight. This oversight is not repeated in Action 2.A.3 on dementia-specific guidelines and curricula, which shows some acknowledgement on the part of NAPA representatives of the value of a competent social work workforce. Social workers are integral members of the professional care teams in every setting and program of health, mental health, and aging services. They perform essential roles which are crucial to the successful delivery of those services, and this is especially true in the context of the multidimensional, bio-psycho-social domains of need in dementia care. Look to the work of the John A. Hartford Foundation's Geriatric Social Work Initiative for information on the importance of shoring up for a gerontologically-competent social work workforce, as well as for models of successful workforce development.</li>
</ul><p>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</p>
<ul><li>The Action Statement suggests a plan for HHS to seek input from public and private entities to complete this activity, but it does not detail a process for identifying or selecting providers of such input. With regard to collecting social work guidelines and curricula, I gladly offer my assistance. There are few such guidelines on social work practice in dementia care, and even fewer curricula. However, this is truly my area of expertise, I have lists of the few resources available, I have developed a graduate social work course exclusively on dementia, and I know of several other experts who would also be willing to assist in this effort.</li>
</ul><p>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</p>
<ul><li>The direct-care workforce includes both those who work in private homes and those who work in facilities, yet this Action Statement is focused exclusively on nursing home personnel. Failure to include home health and home care personnel in this effort would be a tremendous oversight. The preferred location of care for nearly all citizens is their own home, the quality of home care services is known to be inadequate for the general population, and to date there are no research studies which have attempted to examine appropriate home care service models, training protocols, patient and family outcomes, and worker outcomes related to dementia care in the home environment. The home health care and home care industries must be strengthened if we are to avoid a crisis in care. Federal money and coordinated efforts among federal and state agencies, and private industry stakeholders, must be dedicated to addressing improvements in the quality of home care services for individuals living with dementia.</li>
</ul><p>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</p>
<ul><li>The importance of reducing the abuse, neglect and exploitation of individuals with dementia cannot be overstated. Toward this end, the Action Statement should be revised to call specific attention to the need to educate District Attorneys and Assistant District Attorneys about responding to charges brought against alleged perpetrators as a result of police and Protective Services investigations. This is particularly important for victims with dementia who lack the capacity, and often the availability of capable advocates, necessary for seeking justice and protection. For example, financial exploitation charges filed by Protective Service agents are rarely addressed by District Attorneys, and, as a result, the perpetrators are not brought to justice and the elders' funds are not restored.</li>
<li>Adult Protective Service programs are generally overwhelmed and understaffed. Certain states have taken the lead in developing more highly effective programs for dealing with elder mistreatment, such as the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs which supports programs for Elder Protective Services and Elders at Risk. These elder-specific programs should be required in each state. In addition, all Protective Services agents should have access to dementia-specific education. When the victims of elder abuse are individuals with dementia, their vulnerabilities are unique, the investigations are additionally complex, and the intervention options are distinct.</li>
</ul><p>Action 3.E.2: Examine patterns of housing and services</p>
<ul><li>Efforts to understand professional care services must now look beyond simple profiles of service availability and use in order to study the effectiveness and efficiency of the services. Access and use of a service are important issues to measure, but the quality of care provided by these formal service systems (most of which are regulated at the state level) needs to be studied as well. Anecdotal and research-based evidence continually suggests that consumers do not receive adequate care, families are not relieved of their burdens by using formal care services, and community-based services do not effectively postpone nursing home placement. Investments in improved quality of care would likely result in significant long-range savings due to reduced worker turnover, delayed family burnout, delayed nursing home placements, reduced hospitalizations for avoidable medical and behavioral complications, and fewer transitions between care settings.</li>
<li>This Action Statement calls for an in-depth analysis of the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities, but should also include the further development and analysis of the National Home and Hospice Care Survey.</li>
</ul><p>General concern-</p>
<ul><li>This plan does not provide adequate attention to mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers. Dementia frequently co-occurs with mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for mental and physical health problems. Recognizing and treating these conditions plays a vital role in improving patients' cognitive functioning as well as the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.</li>

<p>Please become more informed about the vital and large voting population who have a loved one with dementia or depression or anxiety. The Baby Boomers are one of the largest groups around and have the most voting power as well as the needs for supportive services to keep their loved ones at home. It seems when it comes to home care, respite services and other supportive case management services and counseling are the first ones to be cut. We once had an older adult program here in Illinois and that was cut (temporarily once and completely the 2nd time around). The message you are sending the public is that our government does not value the family as a place for care recipients to grow older (it is a proven statistic that family members experience less depression in the family home than in a nursing home facility). Older Adults deserve our respect and they deserve to continue to have quality care. Please do not let our government succumb to the prejudice of ageism. All people have value especially the old--who have much to still teach us.</p>

<p>Yesterday I sent you a letter regarding the draft National Alzheimer's Plan from a group of national experts on dementia and behavioral health.</p>
<p>Today I am sending a personal letter that is much more detailed. In it I provide comments and suggestions section by section. I hope that you will find it useful in identifying parts of the plan that need to be modified so as to reflect the behavioral health needs and opportunities of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help to redraft the plan in detail.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments I will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>

<td style="text-align:center"><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the only priority of the Plan; its other four goals are of very limited importance.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I do not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But expecting to achieve this by 2025 is wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>I suppose those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts regarding Alzheimer's and other dementias could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere. But this is at best a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly urge HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are the sections of the plan that should reflect behavioral health needs.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, but</p>
<ul><li>The clear priority is bio-medical research seeking pharmacological treatments. There is also a great need for research regarding non-pharmacological, psycho-social interventions, which hold great promise for improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers virtually immediately.</li>
<li>In addition, there is a great need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. It is true that these medications are over-used for people with dementia and can be dangerous. Fortunately, it is also true that non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers, also need information about how to detect co-occurring mental or substance use disorders and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. People with dementia and/or their family members are often served in these settings. And when people with AD in crisis, it is usually the mental health system that is turned to for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders-end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with psychiatric disabilities, who often develop dementia as they age, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia. They, as well as caregivers, can benefit from informational material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other formal care settings such as assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. It is also important to address the likely overuse of anti-psychotics for people with dementia who live in their own homes or with family caregivers.</p>
<p>In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia and should be used only after non-pharmacological interventions have been tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful, failing to mention assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, housing for people with developmental disabilities, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan also fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders make them too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>In addition, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that <strong>there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone</strong>. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>I hope that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what to include in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. Let me add that behavioral health services are not only important for those who are experiencing mental or substance use disorders. In addition, <strong>care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia could result in vastly improved quality of life for them</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better for people with dementia and their families, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking an ultimate solution when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p>I'd like to commend the Department of Health &amp; Human Services for developing an ambitious plan to address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I would add, however, some concern about its apparent overemphasis on biology and pharmacology. Based on my own clinicial experience, chats with colleagues, and reading of the related literature, I can confidently state this focus is necessary but not sufficient. The mental health (i.e., depression &amp; anxiety) of patients and unpaid caregivers alike is inextricably linked to this disease and its treatment. Should these psychological components remain unaddressed, the costs (financial &amp; human) will continue to mount. Conversely, adequate support can reduce this burden, both at the individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>Experts estimate it will take decades before "cures" for Alzheimer's are discovered, let alone made available (and affordable) broadly. While this remains an appropriate aspirational goal, behavioral treatment of the millions currently afflicted, and support for those trying to care for them, must not be sacrificed.</p>

<p>I am very heartened to learn that the federal government released a draft of a comprehensive plan to address Alzheimer's disease. I do want to voice my fervent hope that adequate attention is paid to the mental disorders commonly experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers in the government's plan.</p>
<p>I worked as a psychiatric social worker for 17 years on a locked inpatient hospital geriatric unit, where the predominant diagnoses were Alzheimers or Dementia with agitation, depression, delusions and/or hallucinations. I witnessed the range and severity of symptoms that caused elderly people with dementia to neglect themselves, to become violent, refuse help offered to them even by their own loving children, to become paranoid toward loving family members, and the devastating effects this had on families. Without access to mental health treatment provided by knowledgeable geriatric psychiatrists and other practitioners, these individuals suffering from dementia would remain in agony and distress, harmful to themselves and others.</p>
<p>I applaud our government for addressing Alzheimers disease and urge you to carefully consider the mental health needs of this population in planning for the future.</p>

<p>As you draw up plans to address the needs of the growing population of people with Alzheimers Disease and dimentia I ask that you would consider the <em>mental</em> health needs of both the caregivers and the patients.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law has been declining as a result of alzheimers, and as one of a many family member team that takes shifts caring for her I know how rough it is to maintain a positive attitude and stamina as her condition declines from one plateau to another.</p>
<p>If you are developing a <em>comprehensive</em> plan, I would think it would be critical to recognize the challenges of mental health and well-being as part of that overall picture, and include steps in your plan to support a mentally healthy population.</p>
<p>Please do not under estimate this critical aspect. The mental attitude of both the patient and the caregiver(s) can make an enormous difference in whether the patient is happy and the caregiver is attentive and loving.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider this aspect. People can be old and *well*.</p>

<p>We, Drs. Matthew P. Janicki and Seth M. Keller, are the co-chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. On behalf of the National Task Group, we wish to make our thoughts and recommendations available to the Advisory Council with respect to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To complement the National Alzheimer's Plan Act process, the National Task Group was convened and produced a report titled, "<strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em></strong>", which was designed, in part, to develop and enhance community care options for aging adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The National Task Group also issued the "<strong><em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em></strong>" as part of this report. The National Task Group issued this Action Plan in January 2012 in the hopes that it would promote better understanding of how adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities age and how dementia, in particular, affects them.</p>
<p>We note that the issues we identified in the National Task Group's report, which was submitted to the Advisory Council at its January 17th meeting, has many parallels with those raised in the Draft Plan. Our report summarized and addressed some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Our report also noted that older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have special needs that at times require different actions than those provided for people in the general population. Alzheimer's disease affects everyone; but not everyone can be treated the same way when they are affected by this disease.</p>
<p>We have submitted these comments in order to clarify and provide feedback to the Advisory Council regarding its Draft Plan. First, we would like to note that the National Task Group is pleased that the Draft Plan contains mention of intellectual disabilities (in Strategy 2.H) as this group of Americans is composed of a significant number of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for Alzheimer's disease. We also would like the Draft Plan to contain at least mention of some general issues that we have raised in our Report and also have more elaboration on some key specific issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Given this, we'd like to offer the following comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Missing mention of the significance of Down syndrome in Alzheimer's research</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the text under Goal 1, neglects mention of the research with respect to the needs of people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certainly sustained research is warranted to better understand the etiology and course of dementia in this group of individuals. Additionally, notwithstanding the competing beliefs of whether research involving people with Down syndrome will benefit general research into the nature and cause of Alzheimer's disease, we feel that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will certainly benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down syndrome also demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. We would like to emphasize that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention that given the high risk of Alzheimer's disease among adults with Down syndrome, there is the continued need for focused basic and treatment research involving people with Down syndrome -- and this should be included under Goal 1. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>We note with satisfaction that the Advisory Council's Draft Plan recognized the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). However, we would like to recommend that mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities receive mention earlier in this section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. We would like to see the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Further, under the Strategies noted under Goal 2, it is important to propose that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only look into improvements of care for this specific population, but also, and perhaps more importantly, increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities earlier in the second section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</em></strong></p>
<p>Under Strategy 2.B, we would also like to recommend that mention be made of the challenges of carrying out effective screening and diagnoses for dementia among most individuals with intellectual disabilities due to their inherently varying abilities and cognitive functions. When nationally applicable instrumentation is developed or recommended it would be highly beneficial to make mention in the Draft Plan of the need for specialized screening instruments for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The National Task Group is currently undertaking the development of such an administrative screen, which would have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population. Recognition of this special need and work by the National Task Group would go far to gain acceptance of a regularized screen applicable to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We also would recommend -- adding text under Strategy 2.E -- that the notion that community care, as noted in the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, be the paramount means of long-term 'dementia capable' care delivery. We note specifically the growing evidence-based research that is supporting the inclusion of small group homes -- as a viable assisted living model -- and their role as a potentially powerful alternative care setting for people with dementia, and in particular those with lifelong disabilities. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with certain intellectual disabilities and that any national guidelines produced contain this consideration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also strongly recommend the consideration of the use of small group homes for the community 'dementia capable' care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia as backed by evidence-based research in the intellectual disabilities field.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>As many adults with intellectual disabilities and in particular those with Down syndrome remain in their family homes living with their parents or other family caregivers as they grow older, it is crucial that under Goal 3 inclusion of the challenges faced by these caregivers -- when providing care-at-home to their relatives with intellectual disabilities and dementia -- be given due mention. These 'life-long caregivers' warrant special attention in the Draft Plan as they are providing an important and crucial bulwark against costly institutionalization and oft-times inappropriate admissions to long-term care facilities. They are also often vexed by emerging symptoms of dementia in their adult children who have successfully mastered many general activities of daily living and now are manifesting decline. Special mention to the situations of these lifelong caregivers should be made in the Draft Plan. In this context, the National Task Group also recommends that Strategy 3.C.1. be amended to recognize that in many settings concerned with adults with intellectual disabilities, decisions are often made by proxy (and not by 'middle-aged adults') and that adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs. Thus, consideration should be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the enhanced public education resources related to intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Under Goal 4, we strongly recommend including the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities under public education campaigns and that the greater coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector should get mention. As the state developmental disabilities authorities (agencies) are instrumental in helping organize state functions and programs with respect to intellectual and developmental disabilities it would be extremely beneficial to include these entities (and state developmental disabilities planning councils) in any public education efforts at the state level. Also, education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. As there are health care disparities, an aggressive education campaign should involve universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists as it relates to cognitive and functional disability and its detrimental effect on caregivers and quality of life of the individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The National Task Group recognizes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. Given this, we are very pleased that the Advisory Council recognized the import of the special challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this group in Strategy 2.H. We would hope for those adults with intellectual disabilities currently affected by dementia and those in the next generation who may be affected (as the timeline for the NAPA process encompasses the next 13 years) that the Advisory Council will recognize other areas of inclusion of the specific issues affecting individuals with intellectual disabilities within the Draft Plan and accept our recommendations for additional areas of mention and focus.</p>
<p>We trust the our comments and recommendations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are provided -- as the collective concerns and thoughts of a significant body of professionals, scientists, administrators, family caregivers and advocates, and persons personally affected by dementia -- who are represented by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy. I have signed onto a letter drafted by Michael Friedman, MSW and signed on by the vast majority of members of a group of experts assembled in December of 2011, in Washington DC, by SAMHSA, to inform them of the psychosocial, mental health and behavioral issues, concerns and strategies that should be included in the NAPA plan. We are all disappointed that few, if any of our input has been included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>I support everything in the letter from the group but would add the following two comments:</p>
<ol><li>Not only do we need more research on psychosocial interventions, but also on creative engagement interventions. There is an increasing number of successful art and creativity programs (Stagebridge, Kairos Dance, TimeSlips, SPARK, Art Care, Memories in the Making) for persons with dementia, that are making a difference in the quality of life not only for the person, but also for the caregivers. We all know that most aggressive or violent behavior in persons with dementia is behavior that is trying to communicate something else besides aggression; most often pain, boredom, grief, loneliness or urgency of personal body functions. As we develop relationships with people with dementia, we learn their language and can anticipate their unspoken needs by learning what they are communicating to us. Creative engagement and art programs can provide fun and adult-like experience that help us to hear the voices of those with dementia and to avert disaster before it happens.</li>
<li>I would also add that in searching for alternatives to nursing homes for those with Alzheimer's disease, consider the thousands of adult day health care programs that are providing creative and psychosocial interventions, as well as nursing care to over 260,000 participants and family caregivers. ADS have become a preferred platform for chronic disease management with much higher percentages of care provided for hypertension, physical disability, cardiovascular disease, mental illness and developmental disability. (Metlife, 2010). These are all medical issues that compound the care of persons with Alzheimer's disease. According to this national survey, conducted in 2010, by The Ohio State University and funded by MetLife Mature Market Institute, the adult day centers are leaders in community based care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. (over 75% of centers offer cognitive and memory training programs, and educational programs for Alzheimer's disease).</li>
</ol><p>I hope that you will find these comments helpful in identifying what to include in the final national plan for persons with Alzheimer's in America. We do need research for persons with dementia, but not only for new drug interventions. We need research in these psychological and psychosocial interventions also. We must not ignore the 5.4 million persons living with Alzheimer's disease NOW!</p>

<p>The Mental Health Association in New York State, Inc., the undersigned, is writing in response to the draft National Alzheimer's Plan recently released for comment by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>We are all pleased that a National Alzheimer's Plan is being developed in recognition of the vast growth of the number of people who will have Alzheimer's or other dementias during the elder boom, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft plan.</p>
<p>However, we all believe that the draft plan is inadequate in several critical ways.</p>
<p><strong>Imbalance of Use of Funding</strong>: The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to deal with Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future, but it does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83%) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. That's less than $2 per person. This is simply not adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Attention to Research About Psychosocial Interventions</strong>: The clear tilt of the draft plan is towards research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. It seems to focus heavily on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. Prevention, cure, or effective slowing of the progression of dementia are, of course, much to be desired. But we do not believe that it is at all likely that this will be achieved by 2025--the goal of this plan--and even if it is, the millions of people who now have or will develop dementia prior to that will not be helped at all.</p>
<p>We know that psychosocial interventions can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers, but we need to know more--to develop truly evidence-based practices. We strongly urge those developing the research plan to pay much more attention to research about psycho-social interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Attention to Mental Disorders Commonly Experienced by People with Dementia and their Caregivers</strong>: People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. (See Lyketsos, et al) When this happens, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. Yet, the role of the mental health system is barely reflected in the draft plan.</p>
<p>In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. There are evidence-based family support interventions. (See Mittelman). The need for supports for family caregivers is noted in the plan, but briefly and with little substance.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that failure to address issues of mental health will result in continued failure to meet fundamental needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<p>I am a co-author and now facilitator for our state plan, <strong>Conquering the Specter of Alzheimer's Disease in South Carolina</strong>, which was presented to the State Legislature on March 1, 2009. Needless to say, I have a keen interest in a national strategy to fight this disease. One of the recommendations that came out of South Carolina's task force was the involvement of the work force in supporting and assisting caregivers. Following is one of the recommendations in our plan regarding employers enabling caregivers to remain in the work force. This seems to coincide with the priorities of the national plan and represents an area not specifically addressed through the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 20</strong>. Promote and support private and public sector businesses in addressing the needs of employees who are caregivers to persons with ADRD through the use of on-site respite, support groups, or other initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Seventy percent of people with ADRD are living at home, most of whom receive unpaid help from family members<sup>[i]</sup>. One study of family and other unpaid caregivers of people with ADRD found that 57% were employed full time or part time. Of those who were employed, two-thirds said they had to go in late, leave early or take time off because of caregiving; 18% had to take a leave of absence; 13% had reduced their hours; and 8% had turned down promotions<sup>[ii]</sup>. Eight percent of caregivers in the study had quit work entirely because of caregiving. Another study of family and other unpaid caregivers of more than 2,000 older people found that caregivers of people who had Alzheimer's or other dementias without behavioral symptoms were 31% more likely than caregivers of other older people to have reduced their hours or quit work<sup>[iii]</sup>. Caregivers of people who had Alzheimer's or other dementias with behavioral symptoms were 68% more likely than caregivers of other older people to have reduced their hours or quit work<sup>[iv]</sup>.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 49, after struggling to get a diagnoses from age 39. We need to better educate our doctors.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to read many of the public comments. Many referred Psychologists and Neuropsychologists that may not have been in the plan. While I think they can add a benefit to people with AD, they can also hinder diagnose, as was done to me. In my experience it delayed my diagnoses for about 10 years, not to mention the financial burden it created to our health system. Many need to be better educated on how people with AD react to the test they provide. They also need to put some merit in what their patients and caregivers may share with them. Especially if the caregiver is a RN.</p>
<p>In June 1999, I had my first full Neuropsychological Evaluation conducted by Dr. Lindsey Robinson. The summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills relatively evenly developed. Neuropsychological testing revealed moderate to severe impairments in information processing speed and sustained attention, with mild to moderate impairments in verbal learning efficiency. Short-term attention, expressive/receptive language skills, verbal and nonverbal abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were within normal limits for age. There was no evidence of clinically significant depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder which might account for the patient's cognitive deficits. The etiology of Mr. Ellenbogen's cognitive impairment is unclear as, from a neuropsychological perspective, his symptoms are nonspecific. However, the magnitude of impairment observed on objective testing, in the absence of identifiable affective disorder, does suggest the presence of some form of organic cerebral dysfunction. Further neurological evaluation recommended.</em></p>
<p>I another appointment with Dr. Lindsey Robinson on February 2001. It was frustrating dealing with these doctors because every time I had to see a new doctor or take a test, my primary doctor needed to okay it. The other frustration was that sometimes I had to wait 5 months for appointments, which was the case with this appointment. The test that I was about to retake was questionable. I was not sure my insurance would cover the procedure, so I had to jump through hoops with the doctor and my insurance company. If the test was not covered, it would cost me about $2,500.00. When you deal with these insurance companies, document the conversation for yourself and ask them to do the same. I cannot tell you how many times they tried to get out of paying, but then they checked their records and saw I had received pre-approval. They kept putting up roadblocks and I had to be in touch with them a lot, when I should have been working. It was bad enough that I had to leave work for appointments, I did not need the added aggravation from the insurance company.</p>
<p>I finally met with Dr. Lindsey Robinson. She had commented on my other doctors findings in the beginning of her report: <em>The etiology of his cognitive symptoms was felt to be multifactorial, including normal aging, alcohol consumption, and anxiety.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I saw those comments, I was very angry. She was making up her mind before even administering the test.</p>
<p>Her summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with no significant discrepancy between verbal cognitive skills and nonverbal reasoning abilities, There is no significant change in overall intellectual ability in comparison with the evaluation in June of 1999. On neuropsychological testing, Mr. Ellenbogen displays generalized psychomotor slowing and inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and memory. In comparison with the previous evaluation, a variable, inconsistent pattern of change was demonstrated, with improvements on some measures and declines on others. This pattern of performance is not suggestive of focal or lateralized organic cerebral dysfunction, and is not consistent with the presence of a progressive cognitive disorder. Rather, Mr. Ellenbogen's neuropsychological test performance suggestive of fluctuating levels of attention, concentration, and performance speed. Objective psychological screening suggest the presence of mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and an introspective, perfectionistic personality style. These psychological symptoms are most likely playing a significant role in Mr. Ellenbogen's subjective cognitive dysfunction.</em></p>
<p>She encouraged me to seek a psychiatric consultation to determine whether a trial of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication might be helpful in ameliorating my cognitive symptoms. She got me so aggravated, and she would not listen to anything my wife or I tried to tell her. She just did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>I went back to Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson, the Clinical Neuropsychologist, in January 2006. She was going to redo the neuropsychological testing. I thought it would be best to use this doctor again because she had a baseline for me and could compare my new results with the old. It would take months for the results. The other issue was that there were not many doctors, who performed this test, that were covered under my health insurance policy.</p>
<p>In June 2006, just a few weeks after my 48th birthday, Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson finally got back with the results of my testing. Her results for neuropsychological testing were as follows: <em>Background -- Previous neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001 revealed fluctuating, inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and performance speed, and symptoms consistent with anxiety and depression. Summary and recommendations -- Multiple aspects of Mr. Ellenbogen's behavior and test performance suggestive of inconsistent/incomplete effort during the evaluation. Thus, this test results described are not regarded as a valid representation of his optimal cognitive functioning. Mr. Ellenbogen's clinical presentation and test are unchanged in comparison with prior neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001. There is no evidence of progression of cognitive impairments, and Mr. Ellenbogen's developmental history and current test performance are not consistent with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any other organically-based cognitive disorder. Mr. Ellenbogen demonstrated an anxious/ obsessive personality style and some symptoms of depression. His cognitive can be most parsimoniously attributed to affective disorder and/or other motivational or psychological factors.</em></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Impression;</em></p>
<p><em>R/O Dementia (not in evidence)<br />
					R/O Anxiety Disorder, NOS<br />
					R/O Personality Disorder, NOS</em></p>
<p>Her recommendations -- <em>Mr. Ellenbogen should be reassured that thorough medical/neurological evaluation on multiple occasions has revealed no evidence of neurological cause for his cognitive symptoms. A trial of psychotropic medication could be considered to address Mr. Ellenbogen's apparent effective symptoms. He is unlikely to benefit from psychotherapy due to his reluctance to accept a non-medical explanation for his symptoms.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I met with her and read this report, I was so upset that I had made the decision to go back to her. First of all, during my testing we were not in a quiet area. Anytime I hear noise, it just throws me off. I have difficulty processing and concentrating when that occurs. There was nothing she could do to make it better. I tried very hard to be accurate during my testing and worked as quickly as I could. I tried to inform her that she was wrong in her findings, but she did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>She was so confident in her failure to diagnose me properly, that when I had reach out to her to make her aware that other Psychologists and Neuropsychologists determined that I did have Alzheimer's. She insisted on writing a letter to tell my primary doctor, that the others were wrong and she felt that her diagnosis was correct. Since that day I tried to reach out to her and gave her the opportunity to see the conclusions that 3 other doctors cane up with, but her office refused. Doctors like this will only hurt people like me. There should be a specific testing they must go through before they can test YOAD patients.</p>
<p>Maybe someone from your office can educate her. [address removed]</p>
<p>As you can see, it requires special doctors with the right training to deal with YOAD. I hope you will insure that happens.</p>

<p>I serve on the North Carolina Healthy Aging Coalition and am excited about the proposed national plan addressing Alzheimer's Disease. I have a few comments that may already be inferred in sections of the draft, but did not specifically see the following addressed:</p>
<ul><li>On page 14 ,Action 2.A.2 talks about encouraging providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties and I would like Allied Health professionals added to this section since many of us provide direct care to individuals and their caregivers of those with Alzheimer's Disease.</li>
<li>On page 14, Action 2.A.4 talks about strengthening the direct-care workforce. I whole-heartedly agree that this is needed; but also think there needs to be a plan of action to increase the number of cost-effective sites that are designed specifically for those with Alzheimer's Disease. I know later in the Plan, there is discussion about different housing options, but feel that this could be strengthened in the Plan. From my experience, many families do not have the funds to have their loved one cared for in a "Memory Cottage." Along the same lines, perhaps some type of long term health care insurance for dementia could be provided, if it is not currently available.</li>
<li>On page 21, Goal 3 indicates $10.5 million dollars will be available in 2013 to support caregivers' needs, but does not indicate how this money will be dispersed and who can apply for the monies.</li>
<li>One area I did not seen mentioned in the Plan is research money for prevention strategies, such as fall prevention and home safety. Both of these preventative strategies are crucial in helping the person with Alzheimer's not only remain in their home longer, but also promote their functional performance and integrity.</li>
</ul><p>Thanks for the opportunity to share my thoughts and I look forward to seeing the final Plan,</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>The <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> is available for comment until March 30. This is a very important plan with significant implications for older adults and their caregivers. I encourage you to review the draft and submit any comments to Helen Lamont (helen.lamont@hhs.gov). If there are elements you would like to discuss, given their relevance to North Carolina, please share them via the listserv.</p>
<p>Once the plan is finalized, we will want to consider what we can do to promote implementation in North Carolina. The CDC-Healthy Aging Research Network's Healthy Brain Workgroup will be very engaged, and there will be important roles for geriatric education centers, academic institutions, aging services, public health, mental health, healthcare and indeed, for all of us.</p>
<p>Best to you!</p>

<p>This is a follow-up to my speech yesterday with an expanded version. I was concerned in keeping my 3 minute limit, which made me a bit nervous.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to thank you, the federal and non federal committee members, and all others involved, for what have already been accomplished, but we still have a long way to go. Money is going to be the biggest issue, even though the president recently committed more.</p>
<p>I am a 53 year old, living with Alzheimer's. I was diagnosed at age 49 after struggling for 10 years to get a diagnosis from age 39.</p>
<p>I have a few issues to address. The first one is related to 2025 date which was originally thought of, I have heard many on this committee and others with the dissatisfaction of that date. I strongly recommend that we show urgency and use the 2020date that everyone seems to support. I know it will take some courage on many of you to rethink this date but do it for all of us who have been waiting so long already. Just look back at the momentum and target dates they were trying to shot for HIV and Cancer. They were much more aggressive.</p>
<p>Second issues is the disparity around this disease. While I would like to see more funding dedicated to Alzheimer's, that may not always be possible. Today 18.7 percent of the NIH research budget goes to cancer, 9.9% to HIV, and just 1.4% to Alzheimer's. We need to be more fairly with the designation of those dollar amounts. There are many more people living with Alzheimer's than HIV, yet it receives much less funding. More funding is desperately for Alzheimer. They are all important causes and should be treated fairly. Keep in mind 98 percent of breast cancer patients continue to have a normal life when it its diagnosed early. Yet Alzheimer's patients do not have any chance what so ever. In fact 40% of their last years are so horrific that you would not wish it on your worst enemy, but all of our families have to endure it and become ill in the process..</p>
<p>And last, a subject that no one wants to talk about, but can save millions. The right to die with the help of a doctors. Many of us who have this disease do not want to ride it out to the end. We want to be remembered in a more positive view. We also do not want our families to suffer or have the added financial burden. Please consider the right to die for devastating diseases like this. While I do not like to talk about this, it is important to know how so many of us feel. I have had the opportunity to speak with other like me and they feel the same way. My biggest concern is that I may take my life much earlier than I need to or I may even screw up in the process and great a bigger medical condition because I did it to late and failed. That would not have been an issue a few years ago, when I had guns in the house. I gave the up for the concern for my own family. I did not want to wake up one day and think that they were intruders and shoot them. I would love to opportunity to let someone know what my wishes are based on a number of question answered so they know at what point and time they should acct on my wishes. It can be as simples as a score on the mini mental exam done at two different times. Please don't make me and my family suffer more than I need to. Have some passion. And of course this is based on being able to make these decision when one was still capable to make those decisions with a sound mind, which I still have.</p>
<p>I would also like to volunteer my services to be on your committees to represents others like myself who has this debilitating disease.</p>
<p>I would also like to see an open public input conference line, for all future meetings. I think it's very important for people like me to voice their opinions. What I did not like about the meeting is where many companies are trying to self advertise their special interest for their companies. There is a time for that and it should not take away from the people who are living with the pain. One example was the person representing GE and the petscan. We all know this is great product and all know it's needed, but they should have more brains then that.</p>
<p>Thanks again for hearing my shorten version yesterday and reading my extended version now.</p>

<p>As a Caregiver and Advocate for those affected by Alzheimer's Disease, I am Extremely pleased with the Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Given the fact that people are living longer, this Dreadful, Devastating disease is on the Fast track to becoming an Epidemic, which I am confident The National Plan will in deed keep in check and make much more manageable, so long as it is Fully Supported and Enforced.</p>
<p>Below, I wish to offer my input, which comes from Real Life Experience as a Caregiver and Advocate</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you will find this input most helpful.</p>
<p><strong>With Respect To Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<p>One of the Keys to Success in Keeping Alzheimer's Disease In Check Is Early, Timely Diagnosis.</p>
<p>I have found in my work as a Caregiver and Advocate that Alzheimer's enters the lives of those affected in ways we may classify as minor or may overlook such as; having to write things down more often, patterns of not being able to locate items or patterns of memory lapses, all of which we may joke off as ' Pre- Senior or Senior Moments '.</p>
<p>It is up to All Of Us to Keep An Eye On Each Other and Those Around Us, Should we see these behaviors, we Must Take Them Seriously and Track Them As Such.</p>
<p>Cognitive Testing / Evaluations Must Become Part Of Routine Exams For Everyone ,As We Never Know Where or When This Dreadful Disease May Strike.</p>
<p>With Respect To Testing / Evaluation, It Must Be More than asking a person their name, what day it is, what year it is and who the President is. I Propose we include questioning about work, family, driving skills, life skills, household management, personal care. In addition to Monitoring Personality / Behavioral Status and Changes.</p>
<p>The Key here is Proper Evaluation, Monitoring, Detection of Changes and Knowing When To Red Flag.</p>
<p><strong>Education / Training:</strong></p>
<p>Education and Training are Critically Important and Mandatory in the Diagnosis, Treatment and Care of Those Affected By Alzheimer's Disease, and Must Be An Ongoing Process As The Disease Evolves Over Time.</p>
<p>Through my Exposure and Experience I have seen the Blood Boiling Impact that Those With Poor / Little To No Knowledge, Education and Training can have when it comes to Alzheimer's, from Arguing with Patients , Poor / In-Effective Communication Skills to Leaving Patients Un-Attended. All of which are 100 Percent Un-Acceptable and In-Excusable.</p>
<p>People who are working in Any Capacity With Those Affected By Alzheimer's Must Be The Best Of The Best, The Cream Of The Crop as There Is No Room To Settle For Second Best.</p>
<p>Ill Willed or Under Qualified People Pose A Grave Danger and Threat To Those With Alzheimer's and We Must Ensure, The Best Of The Best Are Ready, Willing and Able To Step Up and Provide The Necessary Care.</p>
<p><strong>Caregivers and Support:</strong></p>
<p>Formal, Thorough, Ongoing Education, Training and Support Are Essential at All levels of the Caregiving Process, and It Must Be Seamless.</p>
<p>There Must Also Be Flexibility Within Medical Coverage Of All Types To Allow For Flexibility and Out of Network / Program Services If These Out Of Network / Program Services Provide A Level of Care / Support Which Standards and Quality Exceed In Network / Program. Why Should Those With Alzheimer's and Their Caregivers Be Backed Into A Corner Which Forces Acceptance Of Sub-Standard Services?</p>
<p>Caregivers at All levels also Need Adequate and Timely Relief To Prevent ' Burnout ' and To Tend To Their Own Personal Health and Affairs.</p>
<p>Caregivers Must Be Educated and Informed Of All Available Support Services, which as a Caregiver , Myself Can Be Overwhelming , In and Of Itself, As Most Are Unsure Of How To Begin The Process Of Locating Services or Lack the Time and Energy To Do So.</p>
<p>Given This, I wish to offer my services, as an official community resource, with respect to assisting Caregivers research, locate, apply for and coordinate support services. I have Professionally and Successfully Linked Caregivers with a myriad of support services ranging from In Home Personal Care Services to Financial and Prescription Support Services.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>In Closing, I Agree That Alzheimer's Is Quickly Approaching Epidemic Levels and If We Fail To Act Now, This Failure Will Prove To Be Devastating To Say The Least.</p>
<p>The National Plan, When Combined With Input, Such As Contained In This Document, Ensure That A Proactive Approach Will Lessen The Burden and Devastation Of Alzheimer's At All Levels.</p>
<p>We Must Also Unite and Advocate Tirelessly To Ensure Every Aspect Of This Plan Does Not Fall Prey To The " Politics ' Of Our Government ,As That Too Will Prove To Be Devastating.</p>
<p>Thank You For The Opportunity To Provide Input On The National Plan, It Has Been An Extreme Honor To Say The Least and I Look Forward To This Being Fully Enacted and Enforced.</p>

					NAPA Advisory Council Teleconference Meeting<br />
					March 14, 2012</p>
<p>On January 17, 2012 I addressed the Advisory Council about the need to include people with Down syndrome in all aspects of dementia related research, including clinical trials. I come before you today with great concern that any reference to Down syndrome, a genetic condition known to pose a considerable risk with respect to dementia, has been obviously omitted from the current Draft National Plan, particularly in Goal 1. This group of individuals deserves to be specifically identified in the National Plan. A vague reference to their existence embedded in the 21st page of the current Draft is grossly understated and should be remedied in future Draft National Plans.</p>
<p>Support for research is essential to better understand the disease process, the potential for early identification and the possibility for improved treatment practices. This research may not only benefit individuals with Down syndrome but the general population as well. The Research Summit in May 2012 referred to in the Draft National Plan should be inclusive of those involved in the study of Down syndrome. I strongly urge you to give serious consideration to the letter submitted by the nationally recognized group of researchers and clinicians read today by Dr. Peterson. Inclusion will help to reduce the potential for greater medical disparities so often faced by this group of individuals. I urge you to act responsibly in their regard. Though some members of the Advisory Council may consider Alzheimer's disease within the Down syndrome community as a different disease process, I can assure you, as a family member, that it looks the same, acts the same and has the same tragic ending, more often at a much younger age.</p>
<p>Families of those with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities deserve more than inattention by the Advisory Council and the Draft National Plan. Care commitments for adults with late life disability attributed to the onset of dementia can differ from the care commitments required for those with lifelong disabilities who then develop dementia. Certainly, these distinctions warrant mention in the Plan. The plan should include specific reference to the need for special supports for family caregivers now dually challenged by lifetime care sacrifices and the emerging additional needs of an adult child with an intellectual disability affected by dementia. As individuals with intellectual disabilities live longer and may be predisposed to the development of Alzheimer's disease, the role of caregiving is now, more than ever, assumed by siblings of the individual. These family members potentially face the challenges of not only the care needs of their adult sibling with an intellectual disability and dementia but also their parents who may be facing the same issues related to decline. This overwhelming dual role is under recognized and most worthy of notation in the National Plan.</p>
<p>The current draft plan makes no mention of individuals with intellectual disabilities other than the reference in section 2H. Section 2.H.1 recommends the establishment of a future task group to address the issues related to "racial and ethnic minorities and people with intellectual disabilities". It is important to clarify that people with intellectual disabilities tend to develop Alzheimer's disease at the same rate as the general public. People with Down syndrome have a known genetic mutation that results in early onset and a much higher incidence. Reference to the needs of those with Down syndrome should be specifically embedded in all sections of any finalized document, not deferred to some future taskforce.</p>
<p>My great concern is that little or no attention will be paid to the populations disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease after the National Plan is finalized and disseminated. The potential for this to occur can easily become reality as the Affordable Care Act is brought into question and the possibility for a change in HSS leadership exists in an election year. I urge both federal and non-federal members of the Advisory Council to do the hard work required to address the needs of <strong>all</strong> individuals that face the debilitating ravages of Alzheimer's disease. Be thorough and inclusive in your plan and do not yield to the pressure to produce a document that cannot be defined as such.</p>

<p>Having just recently released the <em>Dementia State Plan: Virginia's Response to the Needs of Individuals with Dementia and their Caregivers</em>, the Virginia Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Commission (Commission) welcomes the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (Draft Plan)</em>. The emphasis on promoting research and developing new treatments that prevent and effectively treat the disease, expanding support for people with the disease and their families, and enhancing care quality and coordination are shared goals of both plans and we look forward to working together as state and federal partners in addressing the rapidly mounting Alzheimer's crisis.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 1</em>: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong>, the Commission promotes research, supports all strategies to facilitate dissemination of research findings into medical practice and public health programs, and would welcome federal funding for provider education and outreach. Under <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 2</em>: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, Virginia's own plan calls for coordinating quality dementia services, integrated systems of care, and development of dementia specific training. The Commission welcomes any federal support of this state plan strategy.</p>
<p>The action items in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 3</em>: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families</strong> mirror our own state plan recommendation, "In order to survive, families need dementia friendly solutions for their safety, services and behavioral concerns, including: assessment and diagnosis, counseling and support services, care management, respite care, assistive technologies and home modification, transportation, and payment options including long-term care insurance." Additionally, the Commission supports <em>Draft Plan</em> action items for legal services and stable housing for people with the disease. Because of Virginia's large military and veteran population, the Commission advocates for federal and state partnerships to meet the dementia care needs of this population.</p>
<p>As noted in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 4</em>: Educate the Public About Alzheimer's Disease</strong>, some states and localities "have published plans to address AD that coverage many of the same issues as the National Plan. Leveraging the available resources and programs across these levels of government will aid in the success of these efforts" to advance Alzheimer's Disease awareness and readiness across all levels of government. Finally, both Virginia's plan and the <em>Draft Plan</em> recognize the need to improve data collection to better understand the disease's impact on people with the disease, their families, and the healthcare system and, therefore, <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 5</em>: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong> is also imperative. Specifically, the Commission requests coordination of shared federal and state data and the removal of barriers to sharing of information and best practices.</p>
<p>The Commission looks forward to the final version of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> this spring as the Commonwealth is just beginning its state plan implementation. Concerted efforts in national and state strategic planning will provide the best chance to overcoming this dreaded disease.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Coalition on Mental Health and Aging Comments<br />
					on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Draft National Plan. These comments are being submitted by the National Coalition on Mental Health and Aging (NCMHA). NCMHA is comprised of over 80 members representing professional, consumer and government organizations with expertise in mental health and aging issues. The Coalition members represent national organizations as well as many state and local Mental Health and Aging Coalitions. The goal of the Coalition is to work together to improve the availability and quality of mental health preventive and treatment services for older Americans and their families. Information is available at <a href="http://www.ncmha.org">http://www.ncmha.org</a>.</p>
<p>We are delighted that attention is being paid to the significant and growing problem of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in the United States. However, we hope that the final plan will be more cognizant of the significant mental and behavioral health issues associated with Alzheimer's Disease for which there are effective interventions and supports. Health care teams that include behavioral and mental health professionals create a more effective and comprehensive approach to AD by providing critical evidence-based behavioral health interventions and supportive services for people with AD, their families and caregivers. The inclusion of mental and behavioral health professionals as a part of an interdisciplinary approach to planning, assessment, research, service, training and education is indispensible in efforts to address AD. In that light, we recommend the following for your consideration:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</strong><br />
					The draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors. However, a research agenda that includes critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be considerably more successful and useful to families and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</strong><br />
					The world of AD includes much more than medical practice and public health programs. The fact that there is no current cure for AD and that AD presents a complex picture that includes the socio-emotional needs of individuals with AD, their families and caregivers, means that a broader approach should be taken to translational work. Useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health and mental health care providers and in a wide <em>variety</em> of settings.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</strong><br />
					Given the complexities of AD and the need for a wide variety of service providers to meet the current needs of individuals with AD, their families and caregivers, we urge you to include mental health and behavioral health professionals who offer services for the purpose of improving an individual's psychosocial and mental health or to treat mental illness. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include mental and behavioral health disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</strong><br />
					While we agree that guidelines for delivery of care and measures of quality are needed to ensure people with Alzheimer's disease receive high-quality, culturally-competent care in the many different settings where they are treated, we encourage a broader focus that includes behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with AD. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</strong><br />
					We agree that providing care and supports for families and caregivers can help lessen significant feelings of depression and stress that help delay nursing home placement. We do feel that beginning the description of this strategy with a statement about the eventuality of nursing home placement is not a useful introduction. There are a number of studies and evidence-based interventions that indicate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia that can significantly delay institutional placement of the care recipient.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</strong><br />
					We strongly agree that educating people about their potential need for long-term services and supports and planning ahead can help ensure that individuals with AD receive care in the setting they prefer and that their dignity is maintained. To accomplish this goal, the centrality of mental health, behavioral health and social services personnel to educate, train and counsel individuals with AD, their families and caregivers is indispensable.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</strong><br />
					Psychosocial interventions are important to preserve the dignity of individuals with AD and enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. In addition, professionals in the fields of mental health and behavioral health are accustomed to recognizing the vulnerability of people with AD to neglect and abuse, including financial abuse, and are able to take a proactive approach to dealing with such issues in a variety of home and community-based settings.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong><br />
					The need for stable housing is essential to helping people with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community and is a crucial platform for delivering the necessary health and supportive services. To improve health outcomes and housing stability, the promotion of mental health, behavioral health and social work services in the settings where people with Alzheimer's disease live can positively impact services.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 4.B: Work with state and local governments to improve coordination and identify model initiatives to advance Alzheimer's disease awareness and readiness across the government</strong><br />
					As stated throughout these comments, the inclusion of mental and behavioral health professionals as an integral part of an interdisciplinary approach to planning, assessment, research, service, training and education is critically important to advancing services to people with AD, their families and caregivers.</p>

<p>I wish to make this statement on Wednesday, orally, during the Teleconference, and to have these words below and the names of the co-signers, part of the transcript:</p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is <strong>most urgent, most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to encourage people to complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning most urgent? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The huge epidemic predicted for Alzheimer's makes promoting Advance Care Planning urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning most important? Unlike most diseases, patients can linger in the terminal stage of Advanced Dementia for several years. They may frustrate clinicians, caregivers and loved ones as their disease ravages on. The multiple burdens on others are well known. More than one-third of caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning most challenging? Unlike most diseases, there are often no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." This kind of thinking is typical: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. I'll be trapped in a condition I hate so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only increase the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients an effective advance care plan so they can feel confident they can avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then they will choose to live as long, and as well as possible--as they benefit from improvements in medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning that specifically includes Advanced Dementia needs funding to develop and implement, even if researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. Here's why: Changes in the brains of afflicted people start one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. Meanwhile, it will at best take many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and adopt a policy for widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers who are now destined to get dementia will probably still become demented. Even if new drugs were available today, Alzheimer's-afflicted with who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia... and, wWhen they do, they will be able to rely only on their Advance Directives, to control how long, and how much, they must suffer before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we thus must: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable; and, 2) implement programs to encourage people to complete them.</p>

<p>Cambridge Cognition welcomes the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. In response to the request for comments relating to Strategy 2.b 'ensure timely and accurate diagnosis', and action 2.B.2, 'identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools', the Committee is invited to consider a computerized solution; and the following is submitted:</p>
<ul><li>In the context of an annual wellness check and also in the context of early diagnostic assessment, the careful choice of an appropriate cognitive test is imperative. Many cognitive instruments do not measure with adequate sensitivity the changes in episodic memory that are the characteristic feature of early in course Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.</li>
<li>Cognitive assessments should be sensitive to the changes that occur at the early stages of dementia, norm-referenced, culturally unbiased, easy-to-use and standardized in administration. One example of such a test is the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, a non-verbal, visuospatial measure of cued episodic memory.</li>
<li>Computerized assessments are a vital part of the future of cognitive testing. CANTAB PAL, a test presented on touch screen, is being used in leading scientific and clinical institutions worldwide and by major pharmaceutical companies in their clinical research. This widespread use has resulted in over 70 peer-reviewed publications in dementia. Across a number of studies, the PAL test shows very high levels of sensitivity and specificity in differentiating mild Alzheimer's disease from healthy aging and clinical depression. Furthermore, impaired performance on the PAL test has been shown to predict rate of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with MCI (Swainson et al., 2001; Blackwell et al 2004, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2009; Egarhazi et al 2007; Chandler et al 2008) and in community dwelling samples of older adults (de Jager et al., 2002, 2005). Performance on the PAL test has also been shown to be associated with CSF amyloid beta:tau levels (Barnett et al., 2011).</li>
<li>Beyond its scientific credibility, any test used in a primary care setting must be easy to use, fast and reliable. Ideally, the same test should also be appropriate for use within the context of a comprehensive diagnostic work-up.</li>
<li>Experience gained from the deployment of CANTAB PAL in over 1000 centres has shown that the elderly find the touch screen presentation intuitive and easy to interact with, accommodating a broader range of motor function than other computerized interfaces or even pencil and paper tests.</li>
<li>The wide availability of iPad and other similar devices enables CANTAB PAL to be made available to mainstream healthcare for the first time. This form of the test, known as CANTABmobile, is particularly well suited for use in primary care settings. By using adaptive methodology, the test is completed within 5-7 mins.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile offers key benefits in being both language invariant and culturally neutral. The test instructions are automatically administered using a voiceover in the language selected onscreen. Currently 18 language options are available within the test, including American English and Latin American Spanish. This facility reduces the cost of translation services and ensures patients are assessed quickly regardless of their language. The voiceover and automated stimulus presentation also enables full standardization in test delivery, allowing non-specialist health care professionals to administer the test, again reducing costs and improving quality.</li>
<li>The test takes 5-7 minutes, and automatically finishes if the patient fails at a given level, avoiding patient distress, and ensuring efficient use of time. The results are automatically scored comparing performance against a database of more than 4000 adults, fully adjusting for age, education and gender. The test instantly produces a single page report which clearly indicates the suggested action using a simple traffic light system. The report can be immediately emailed, printed or saved as a pdf.</li>
<li>The CANTABmobile test platform also includes computerised rating scales for depression and activities of daily living, fulfilling the criteria for other aspects of the wellness check, reducing risk of misclassification due to depression. The outputs for these are similarly included in the physician report.</li>
<li>Furthermore, CANTABmobile allows monitoring patients over time (Fowler et al 1995, 1997, 2002), and also anonymized data collation across systems, achieving the aim of facilitating public health outcomes research.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile has been developed for primary care physicians alongside a partner product covering a multi-domain toolkit designed for specialists.</li>
</ul><p>In summary, CANTABmobile delivers a high level of scientific rigor and patient/practitioner convenience. Furthermore, the computerized format enables many additional and desirable features. Embracing computerized solutions, both in primary and specialist services, will enable effective early detection of memory loss and provide an expedient route to diagnosis and intervention.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. Together, with our more than 1,900 member organizations, we serve our nation's most vulnerable citizens: more than 8 million adults and children with mental illness and substance use disorders. We are committed to providing comprehensive, quality care that affords every opportunity for recovery and inclusion in all aspects of community life.</p>
<p>The National Council is, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>The National Council believes, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments the National Council will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the single priority of the Plan; its other four goals are evidently of very limited importance.</p>
<p>The National Council does not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But achieving any of this by 2025 is probably wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>The National Council understands that those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere, but this is a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>The National Council strongly urges HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are some sections of the plan that need to reflect behavioral health issues.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (though it emphasizes biological research), but it does not mention the need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, which probably are over-used currently and are dangerous. Non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers also need information about how to detect a co-occurring mental or substance use disorder and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. It should be noted at the very least that people with AD in crisis often are referred or taken to psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, who are expected to provide treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders--end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with serious and persistent mental illnesses who do not recover over time, as is true for many people with schizophrenia and other treatment refractory mental disorders. People with serious and persistent mental illness also often develop dementia, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment tremendously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other settings such as homes, assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful--such as assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders become too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay or in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>Finally, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The National Council hopes that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what needs to be included in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. The fact of the matter is that good care, care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia and the stress experienced by their family members, could result in vastly improved quality of life for them.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking a cure when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>The National Council would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS OF CONSTANT CARE FAMILY MANAGEMENT SUBMITTED<br />
					TO HSS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					MARCH 5, 2012</strong></p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunity to offer our comments and recommendations regarding the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p>As memory care experts, our Autumn Leaves assisted living communities provide families and residents with compassionate care and innovative solutions that help our residents create a sense of well-being in a comfortable, home-like environment. While reviewing the Draft Framework, we agree with our industry partner, The Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA) that the framework is a good start but there are more components that need to be added to the story.</p>
<p>The recommendations below offer ideas, interpretations and new measures in the draft where we think the strategy can be better fortified to help industry professionals, and residents and their families make more informed decisions while promoting the need to educate, train, detect and respond faster to this deadly disease. Thank you for the opportunity to hear our voice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					Training and specialized programs need mandating for general practitioners, and the healthcare industry overall to recognize early signs and symptoms. Requirements need to be established for individuals 70 years of age and older. Parameters, tools, programs and interview questions that allow physicians to screen for Alzheimer's and dementia need to be implemented much like the way breast cancer checks and prostate exams are set up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					While guidelines for delivery of high-quality care and measures are needed, even more important is the focus on specialized cognitive care activities such as the way to evaluate an individual's ability to complete day to day activities. The goal should be to improve an individual's life by identifying their remaining abilities and offering recommendations and strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					More training and programs need to be implemented on the potential impacts of cognitively impaired individuals, and how transitions disorient and stress the individual.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Better controls and programs need to be established to understand family systems which can oftentimes present a barrier to diagnosis and treatment. Identify the cultural dynamic of communication in order to offer support, education, awareness and help. Likewise, provide support and assistance for younger families so they can have access to the latest information: where to get help, programs designed to provide that help and community outreach services to offer support.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					More awareness programs and information about the importance of planning for healthcare decisions and disease progress need to be available. The primary physician and social worker roles need to be better quantified so they can better help families navigate through this process. Recognition of specific dementia care and related long-term care settings must be identified by policy makers and the insurance industry. More help is needed to assist families with guardianship and how to plan ahead, understand how to deal with crisis moments and realize they need professional legal help for healthcare issues and financial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Programs, training and information need to be available to help educate families and individuals on recognizing abuse and exploitation. Consequently, safety programs, education and training need to be implemented to address issues like wandering and safe return/finding.</p>
<p>A series of safety programs need to be implemented to help:</p>
<ul><li>Caregivers prepare their homes for a loved one living with Alzheimer's.</li>
<li>First responders such as police, fire department, EMS and emergency room personnel understand the necessary steps to take when aiding individuals who are living with Alzheimer's or dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As the disproportionately high rate of African-Americans versus whites living with Alzheimer's continues to rise, more educational services need to be available in the African-American communities to help increase a greater awareness and knowledge-base of the warning signs of Alzheimer's and dementia. The Alzheimer's Association statistics illustrate that the age-specific prevalence of dementia has been found to be 14% to 100% higher in African-American.* The number of African-American age 65 and over will more than double by 2030, from 2.7 million in 1995 to 6.9 million.</p>
<p><strong>The Wandering Emergency</strong><br />
					Wandering is considered an Emergency. Although common, wandering can be dangerous -- even life threatening: speed is of the essence. The statistics show very poor outcomes for elderly wanderers missing beyond 24 hours, and many people cannot remember their name or address. They may become disoriented and lost even in their own neighborhood, and they may become fearful and hide. Many states do not track or report wandering and locating current, up to date statistics are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Wandering is an emergency situation and part of the disease process:</p>
<ul><li>6 in 10 people with Alzheimer's disease will wander.</li>
<li>18% of those with mild dementia wander.</li>
<li>50% of those with severe dementia wander.</li>
<li>Wandering has proven such a common behavior that experts predict 60% to 70% of all people with Alzheimer's will wander away from safety at least once during the course of their illness.</li>
<li>Many will wander 6 to 8 times before they are placed into a residential facility or an outside, qualified caretaker is brought into the home to help.</li>
</ul><p>At Autumn Leaves, we're exploring ways to adapt our communities into designated <em>Safe Havens</em>. We know as individuals lose more and more of their memory, they will often go in search of a particular person, place or thing.</p>
<p>We are working to provide a service where anyone in the public sector that finds an individual wandering, confused of their whereabouts or are lost, can bring that individual to an Autumn Leaves <em>Safe Haven</em> until authorities or family members are contacted. We want to be able to help the emergency responders, and give them the aid and support they need to return individuals back to their loved ones.</p>
<p>Our solution to this very serious issue is multi-faceted:</p>
<ul><li>Expansion of the Silver Alert Program needs activation standards set by federal legislation to ensure there is seamless integration nationally instead of state by state much like the Amber Alert system introduced in 1996. Approximately 29 states have a Silver Alert or similar programs -- all states need to implement and participate.</li>
<li>Education on wandering prevention needs implementation along with understanding GPS technology or emerging technologies.</li>
<li>The Safe Haven concept for 'found' wanderers needs regional awareness to inform the public where and how to find Safe Havens. Likewise, they will need to be informed of the steps in bringing Alzheimer's or dementia wanderers to safe communities.</li>

<p>I request that you please refer the Advisory Council to the following <a href="http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/nuremberg.html">http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/nuremberg.html</a> that discusses informed consent requirements for human research testing. Can you please forward this information to the Advisory Committee that is studying human research testing for citizens with Alzheimer's disease who may not be able to give informed consent.</p>
<p><strong>NUREMBERG CODE </strong></p>
<ol><li>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.
<p>						The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.</p></li>
<li>The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.</li>
<li>The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.</li>
<li>The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.</li>
<li>No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.</li>
<li>The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.</li>
<li>Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.</li>
<li>The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.</li>
<li>During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.</li>
<li>During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.</li>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTARY RE: "DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE"</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect to the contributors and authors of this draft plan, I submit that, if finalized as written, it will do more to destroy the Alzheimer's community and set back any hope of progress toward a solution than anything seen to date in my lifetime.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>As written this is a blatantly politicized piece of campaign rhetoric. I, perhaps surprisingly, am a life-long Democrat and strong supporter of liberal causes who has burned a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors on behalf of liberal candidates starting with Adlai Stevenson in 1952, but I am and have been also a dementia caregiver for over 20 years. This Alzheimer's Disease issue SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! THE PROBLEM IS APOLITICAL, AND SO SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION!</p>
<ol><li>Starting with the Vision Statement. There is NO better vision than that of The Alzheimer's Association - "A world without Alzheimer's Disease".</li>
<li>Certainly President Obama should be given credit for his support, and his supporting statement deserves recognition in the plan, but other people such as former House Speaker Gingrich deserve equal recognition for their contributions toward developing and supporting these efforts as well.</li>
<li>This entire issue of age related cognitive impairment (I've read that there are nearly 100 probable types/causes) deserves the support of EVERY citizen, whatever their political persuasion, and this draft plan mitigates any possibility of achieving that necessary broad level of support.</li>
<li>Further, in the 27 pages of text, I count at least 8 specific references to the "wonderful" AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Why? One should be more than enough, Zero would be better since a) The administration is wavering on implementation with refusal to implement some parts of the law, b) the administration is providing multi-state waivers to other parts, c) there seems to be little agreement or consensus on interpretation of key elements among those few who have struggled to review those nearly 3000 pages, and lastly d) this controversial law has yet to be reviewed for constitutionality by The Supreme Court (partiallly or completely).</li>
</ol><p>I suggest that the intent of those statements can be preserved in a much less controversial way by simply replacing "Affordable Care Act" language with something like "existing and proposed legislation". I think that the PLAN might also allow for the possibility for proposing new, additional legislation should it be considered useful.</p>
<p>With respect to Strategy 1C, I feel it would be most appropriate to add an additional action to address the legal and ethical aspects of early detection. What about those people that show no signs of dementia but are discovered to have major plaque accumulations? Should they be told?</p>
<p>I agree that measurement of the disease's progression is extremely valuable to the caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals, but I think that more than imaging and biomarkers is needed. Today, the "gold standard" of American neurologists and gerontologists is probably the MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), although many more assessment tools have been developed and found useful around the world. Of even more significance is the Allen Cognitive Scale measuring patients ability to contribute to their care in later stages. The PLAN should include recommendations for assessment tool standards to be applied nationwide in evaluating AD/Dementia progression for use in clinical trials, medical reporting, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another observation formed from my having read the proposed draft report numerous times is that the research portion, despite expressing some valid points, still appears to be another somewhat disorganized "hip-shoot" relying on far too much luck and too little deliberate, well thought out planning. Dr. Eric Kandel said it best when he applauded the successes so far and recognized that this whole issue was extremely complex and we had a lot more to learn. The complexity of the challenges clearly represents a "system of systems" which the late Russell Ackoff defined to be a "mess". This entire program cries out for a well-organized systems engineering approach if any progress is to be made in an affordable, rapid manner. Ackoff would have been our guy, but perhaps a colleague or student of his might be found to accomplish this task as soon as possible. A few calls to the systems thinking community in Academia or the International Federation for Systems Research might identify some key people.</p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, I think we can rely on the following:</p>
<ol><li>Age related dementias (other than major vascular events) are slow in development (Some have said that AD may begin in a persons twenties).</li>
<li>AD mechanisms change as the disease progresses and as damage occurs.</li>
<li>Each stage may require markedly different treatments to achieve delay or prevention.</li>
</ol><p>Is it possible that we are discarding treatments because we are applying trials to an inappropriate stage of the disease? (or even to those that may be incorrectly diagnosed?) Can we confidently rely on the FDA to make the appropriate treatment decisions for all stages of AD? I assure you that the "front-line" families become more desperate as the disease continues it's slow progression. I further suspect that most people in the AD community care very little if the treatment is "FDA Approved". The issues really boil down to:</p>
<ol><li>Is the treatment available (anywhere in the world)?</li>
<li>Is the treatment affordable?</li>
<li>Where, when, and how can I get it?</li>
</ol><p>An example of a layman's assessment of possible "treatments" as of today is shown as Attachment 1 to this commentary.</p>
<p>With regard to rapidity, I also have seen other criticisms of the 2025 goal suggesting that a 2020 goal might be better. Certainly, I would like to see a goal of 2010, but I believe that 2025 might be attainable only if we restrict ourselves to those things that are in the "pipeline" today, which in turn have no guarantee of success. I would urge you to consider scheduling several goals, with separate time objectives, recognizing that we are in a cancer or AIDS-like program that might take 50 years to find a "cure". By the way, I also noted that "finding a cure" is not in the list of research objectives. Have you given up?</p>
<p>I would suggest starting as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Identify and treat risks (2012) - Suggestions for good/bad environmental and diet approaches (subject to vary with time and knowledge -- remember discarding our aluminum cookware?) This is like "No Smoking" in the fight against cancer.</li>
<li>Slow and/or stop degradation (2015) This is partially available now for those who respond to Aricept/Namenda combo treatment. Solutions are needed for the large number of people who do NOT respond favorably.</li>
<li>Early Prevention (2020)</li>
<li>Minimize Symptoms (2022)</li>
<li>Delay Onset (2025)</li>
<li>Reversal of Afflictions (2050) - "THE CURE"!!!!</li>
</ol><p>Of course, the above dates are unsupported figments of my imagination, but I hope you see the concept here.</p>
<p>I also found some statements and titles in the described actions that gave me a "where did this come from" moment. Namely, Action 1.B.3 that discusses clinical trials and international outreach. Do you intend to request non-citizens, off-shore, to participate in our clinical trials? This needs some explanation. Another point that underwhelmed me was Action 1.B.4. Is this just pro-forma government speak or is there a real point? Frankly, I am of the very solid opinion that Alzheimer's Disease is about as racially and ethnically diverse and unbiased in selection as is possible in all of humanity. Are you implying that there is bias in the clinical trial community? Is there managed selectivity in who gets the "stuff" and who gets placebo? I highly doubt that! In fact, I doubt that your assumption of higher risk for AD being either racially or ethnically related has any validity at all. I submit that the REAL reason for those observations lie in differences in life-long histories of environment, diet, and health care practices. For example, we are fairly certain that Americans (of my generation) of Greek or Italian ethnic heritage are at lower AD risk levels, most likely due to preferences for a mostly Mediterranean Diet. This risk reduction may not apply to younger generations if they've switched to Drive-Thru Bacon Cheeseburgers. In any case, I suggest that tracking data on historical environment, diet, and health care practices will be much more meaningful, and tracking racial/ethnic populations as suggested will provide little or no contribution toward improved outcomes.</p>
<p>A small, but significant, item that I have some issues with is the stated expected cost of nursing home care at $78,000. A much more representative (and far more meaningful) number can be shown if it were expressed as a range of state cost averages ($70,000 to $150,000) and further adjusted to determine the level of pre-tax retirement income required to sustain the nursing home option (don't forget to include costs for incidentals like toothpaste, shaving cream, haircuts as well as Medicare parts B,C, and D with those costs adjusted for "means testing").</p>
<p>I suspect you will be looking at $150,000 to $250,000 per year. Thus it will be much easier to understand the future economic pressures on Medicaid and will go a long way toward determining the adequacy of an individual's long-term-care planning.</p>
<p>Also, I am very disappointed that this draft plan promulgates the social stigmas so dreaded by those in the Alzheimer's community. I understand the enticement to encourage high funding levels and popular support through fear, but I believe this is counterproductive to the tasks of living with and caring for those with AD. I am also a strong supporter of redefining those people as being "deeply forgetful" as opposed to "Alzheimer's victims", "Alzheimer's sufferers", "Senile individuals", "People with Dementia" or "Cognitively Impaired". Please realize that NOBODY wants to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It WILL rapidly result in loss of life-long friendships, loss of independence, loss of self, loss of peer respect, etc. This is clearly why early diagnoses seldom happen, and why public education is SO important. The stigma extends and becomes tragic when overzealous and uneducated agents of Adult Protective Services who believe the unsupported and unproven claims spread throughout the Elder Abuse channels of government that "most elder abuse comes from spousal and parental relatives/caregivers". I believe that too many malicious prosecutions are executed throughout the country due to proliferation of this myth. Occasionally, States have admitted to errors, documented those errors, and revised state policies (see "HANDCUFFED" by Wisconsin DHS). Other states rigidly support their mistaken beliefs, and I have seen personally the destruction of families, and early, wrongful patient deaths not to mention large legal costs to these families or to the states if public defense is necessary.</p>
<p>Many caregiving families are threatened daily by the health care/ adult protection bureaucracy. Has no one heard of self-inflicted injuries due to agitation? This is why nursing homes use Posey Mitts (soft handcuffs) and load their patients with unwanted drugs. Should patients be arrested and confined if a caregiver is injured? Should caregivers be arrested and confined if a patient exhibits self-inflicted injuries? Should a caregiver be arrested and confined if a patient is inadvertently injured or bruised during an effort to protect another innocent person? Or attempting to protect the general public? Should families be destroyed, Power of Attorney ignored, and spouses of 50 years be separated without visitation upon arrest, with NO conviction? The Plan's legal advisors would provide a great service to the community by prioritizing for both home and professional caregiver's a list of who should get protection/arrest first: a) the general public, b) close bystanders, c) professional caregivers, d) home caregivers, e) spouses and children/parents, or f) the "deeply forgetful" themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some comments on caregiving support needs. The PLAN needs to clearly state as part of Goal 2 that the priority is to provide for in-home care as long as possible in order to provide more favorable outcomes, extend life and quality of life at less cost to both families and government taxpayers. My own personal experiences indicate that respite care for family caregivers and supervised productive day care experiences for the "deeply forgetful" are absolutely mandatory to the achievement of this objective. The only successful application that I have seen was a 1991-1992 experimental program in the State of Georgia with several counties participating. While I understand this program has ended, I believe it was well documented, and I guarantee that as implemented it was indeed a lifesaving experience for participants and caregivers.</p>
<p>As to Nursing Homes, reducing the inappropriate use of anti-psychotics is a good start, but further improvements are necessary, and should begin with significant modification to the criteria by which state licensing authorities evaluate these facilities. Current criteria covers physical safety very well, but ignore many quality of life issues that affect the "deeply forgetful" residents. We often need to remind ourselves that the deeply forgetful are NOT "empty shells", but simply require unique communication techniques. The Plan should look specifically at the results achieved by advanced compassionate thinking in facilities modeled after Lakeview Ranch, those practicing The Eden Alternative, Montessori based care for the "deeply forgetful" and suggest significant modifications to existing licensing and evaluation criteria that could be addressed by all State Licensing Authorities. Also, I am told that many facilities consider it to be too costly to maintain and update resident's care plans, apparently in direct violation of federal laws. This may be lack of education, but certainly indicates lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>Hospitalization offers additional caregiver challenges. "Deeply forgetful" patients require special care, and have special needs above and beyond normal expectations. Electronic (although privacy protected) records are a great idea but should be expanded to include primary caregiver advice and concerns. Hospital personnel need to understand time, behavior, and observation problems as well as the patient's inability to express needs, particularly if in discomfort and pain. Similar observations might be made about any social situation that is not a part of daily routine and familiar people. Examples such as travel (particularly by air), home care visitations, family outings, and especially holidays come readily to mind. People that interact with the "deeply forgetful" need to know that respect and personal dignity are paramount.</p>

<ol><li><u>Please support neurologists who want to specialize in behavioral neurology &amp; neuropsychiatry. We are not mentioned in Action 2.A.2</u>.<br /><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong><br />
						HHS will enhance three programs that encourage providers to focus on geriatric specialties. The Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act, provides traineeships to support students pursuing advanced degrees in geriatric nursing, long-term services and supports, and gero-psychiatric nursing. In addition, HRSA will continue to support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatricians, geriatric dentists, or geriatric psychiatrists. These programs prepare professionals to address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease through service rotations in different care settings. HRSA will also continue to support the career development of geriatric specialists in academia through the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program. Currently 65 percent of these awardees provide interprofessional clinical training on Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li><u>Please consider the neurologists who many patients consider their primary physicians. May neurologist shy away from taking care of patients with dementia because of the time required and low reimbursement for this cognitive speciality</u>.<br /><strong>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</strong><br />
						Medical homes utilize a team approach to provide care and to improve the quality and coordination of health care services. CMMI is currently carrying out the Multi-payer Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration and the Comprehensive Primary Care initiative to measure the effectiveness of medical home models. CMMI will conduct subgroup analyses to examine changes in care quality and care coordination among people with AD to explore whether these models lead to more effective and efficient care.</li>

<p>The Developmental Disabilities Nurses Association supports the specific inclusion of persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) as requested by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG). In most cases, nurses assess individuals with IDD on a more frequent basis than primary health care providers, and thus may note signs and symptoms indicative of early stages of dementia in the settings in which individuals reside or spend their days. This increases the likelihood of prompt referral for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that this medically underserved population, some of whom by the very nature of their developmental disability are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, are considered by the NAPA council for inclusion in its proposal.</p>

<p>OVERALL I FIND THE DRAFT PLAN A REASONABLE AND READABLE DOCUMENT, EVEN THE HHS BOILERPLATE. I HAVE SOME COMMENTS WHICH ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE, WHICH I WILL STATE BRIEFLY: MY WIFE, MARTHA, WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A/D AND COPD IN THE FALL OF 2007. I CARED FOR HER AT HOME WITH SOME RESPITE ASSISTANCE UNTIL I COULD NO LONGER DO SO IN JULY OF 2009. I MOVED HER TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER WHICH TWO HOSPITALIZATIONS MADE IT NECESSARY TO PUT HER IN A HOSPICE FACILITY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. IN JUNE OF 2010 I BROUGHT HER TO THE HOUSE ON HOME HOSPICE. I WILL NEVER REGRET DOING THAT. AFTER 55 DAYS, ON AUGUST 4th, 2010, SHE DIED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>PAGE TWO OF THE PLAN LISTS FOUR GOALS. TWO OF THEM ARE: "... ENHANCE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS' KNOWLEDGE ...", AND "... SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CAREGIVERS ...". THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GOALS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PROMINENCE AND A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. WHY? BECAUSE DISCONTINUITIES IN AVAILABLE MEDICAL CARE ARE A SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM - RIGHT NOW - AND ALZHEIMER'S SUFFERERS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE - RIGHT NOW. WE ALL HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY A CURE WILL BE FOUND FOR ALZHEIMER'S. BUT AN IMMEDIATE AND MORE ACUTE PROBLEM IS COHERENT AND GRADUATED CARE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, AND RELIEF FOR THE BURDEN THIS PLACES ON CAREGIVERS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US:</p>
<ol><li>IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET A DIAGNOSIS. AFTER TWO $600 SESSIONS WITH A MEDICAL "EXPERT" IN THE SPRING AND FALL OF 2007, HE STILL WOULD NOT DIAGNOSE A/D. OUR FAMILY DOCTOR, AN INTERNIST, HAD TO MAKE THE CALL AND BEGIN TREATMENT.</li>
<li>IN JULY 2009, AFTER A HELLISH TWO WEEKS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC TO GET THE RIGHT DOSAGE OF A/D DRUGS, THE DOSAGES STILL WERE NOT RIGHT AND OUR INTERNIST HAD TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS LATER.</li>
<li>BY THE FALL OF 2009 15-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS WITH OUR INTERNIST WERE NO LONGER ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS NO AVAILABLE MEDICAL "NEXT STEP". I FOUND THAT AT LEAST IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI, ALL THE GERIATRICIANS HAVE BEEN COOPTED AND ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL-HOSPICE, NURSING HOME OR HOSPICE INDUSTRIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR AND DO NOT WANT ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS. THEY PREFER PATIENTS WHO NEED MONEY-MAKING REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES.</li>
<li>MONEY IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER. WE HAD NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE PAID UP TO $254 A DAY. NURSING HOMES COSTING $230 A DAY HAD NO OPENINGS, PREFERRING PATIENTS NEEDING THERAPIES. I OPTED FOR A $90 A DAY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, WHICH WAS FINE UNTIL SHE WAS BED-RIDDEN AND HER NEEDS BECAME TOO GREAT FOR ASSISTED LIVING. AS IT WAS, BECAUSE OF THE 90-DAY EXCLUSION ON OUR NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WE BARELY BROKE EVEN ON THAT POLICY.</li>
<li>THE NEXT TRANSITION, AND IT WAS ABRUPT, WAS TO A HOSPICE FACILITY. THE HOSPICE BILLED MEDICARE $1000 A DAY FOR HER CARE. HER CARE THERE WAS PERHAPS TWICE AS GOOD AS IN ASSISTED LIVING, BUT IT WAS NOT ELEVEN TIMES AS GOOD AS THE BILLING WOULD SUGGEST. THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT IS A WONDERFUL THING, BUT THE HOSPICE INDUSTRY IS GETTING FAT ON WHAT IT CHARGES, AND IT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S.</li>
<li>THE LAST TRANSITION WAS IN JUNE OF 2010 AND IT WAS ALSO ABRUPT. I WAS TOLD SHE HAD TIMED OUT OF IN-PATIENT HOSPICE. I FOUND THAT NURSING HOMES WERE STILL NOT INTERESTED IN HER AS A PATIENT SO I OPTED FOR HOME HOSPICE. I PERSONALLY PREFERRED THAT TO A NURSING HOME, BUT EVEN THOUGH I HIRED A CNA AND AN LPN TO SUPPLEMENT MY EFFORTS AND THE HOME HOSPICE EFFORT, WHICH WAS UNEVEN, HER CARE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THAT IN A NURSING HOME . BUT, HOME HOSPICE STILL BILLED MEDICARE $250 A DAY, WHICH WAS MORE THAN A NURSING HOME.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I SAY AGAIN THAT CONTINUITY OF COHERENT AND GRADUATED MEDICAL CARE FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT AND RELIEF FOR THE CAREGIVER IS AN ACUTE AND GROWING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS GREATER EMPHASIS IN YOUR PLAN. IT IS A - RIGHT NOW - PROBLEM, NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHIPPED AWAY AT OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF MY WIFE'S COPD COMPLICATION, WHICH REQUIRED 24/7 OXYGEN, OUR ORDEAL WAS MERCIFULLY SHORTER, LESS THAN THREE YEARS, THAN IS TYPICAL FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. OTHERS HAVE IT HARDER THAN WE DID.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I HAVE DETAILED RECORDS FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID ABOVE. I CAN PROVIDE ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU NEED FROM ME.</p>

<p>Adult day health services should be an important part of any plan to either slow the progress of Alzheimer's, improve quality of life, or to support caregivers.</p>
<p>Social interaction, rather than isolation at home, and physical and mental stimulation are keys to slowing memory loss, preventing agitation, and enhancing life.</p>
<p>Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's are more likely to suffer debilitating illnesses themselves so respite is important. Adult day health services can be all of the above.</p>

<p>In relation to your research,published by the European College on Psychopharmacology, published by Reuters agency on 05.09.2011, from Prof.Dr.Hans-Ulrich Wittchen,I'm sending you the attached material.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SCREEN OF THE HEALTH IN THE HAIRY BACK</strong></p>
<p>Today we are living in a wold filed with tension, broken families, psychological whirlpool and local wars.The human self is torn apart, and it seems that prevents milion of people from being together and free.We consider that the reason for this is the Syndrom of the Emotional Breakdown (SEB),that has a visible external sign.We are convinced that there is a functional virus,that penetrates the limbic system of the human barain,as a result of improper emotional impact.</p>
<p>Reretfully,during the course of evolution,the human had developed his brain to a level,to be able to hurt himself by means of thoughts.There exist mental viruses,or functional viruses.They cause a contamination in the emotional assessments of the humans,and as a result of this he develops a diagnoses SEB.The contaminated person generates in the course of his daily life toxic thoughts that create in egological contamination.</p>
<p>In a person living with SEB, in the hairy back of the head could be visualised a red patch in different shades - from light pink , through bright red, to dark purple.It could be on spots , or on well-seen red figures- different variants exist.When the patch becomes dark purple, it means that this individuals is about 30-40 hours away from death.</p>
<p>We consider that the SEB is a reason for destruction of personality, the reason makes people live in disharmony with themselves and with society.</p>
<p>How could Homo Spiens be infected with the SEB f.virus?</p>
<p>By receiving improper emotional value,quarrel in a bus, short negative telefone conversation, scolding a child for breaking by accident the Christmas toy, not keeping the right of way on a crossroad, watching a conflicting T.V. show - in short experiencing negative feeling. (1)</p>
<p>The very act of infecting is a mental action, armed at hurting someone.In such a way an individual,or the society as a whole could be infected.Each person is in constant contact with other.Even the mere presence without talking, or seeing is a form of contact.</p>
<p>Long time ago the man had invented the mental weapon, but still there is no vaccine, or some kind of defence against the negative impact, that only humans are able to inflict upon each other.That is why when we are hurting others, we are hurt ing also ourselves.</p>
<p>After the f.virus gets in the limbic system it may be inactive for a period of time - sometimes it may take years before it strikes the host.An egological contamination of the planet is being created.</p>
<p>It has been observed, that in infants, the patch dissapears after a proper drug treatmentand parents care.There are adults with a well visible path, their body is fightingto reach the necessary balance.</p>
<p>A man is a buld in such a way, that from the day he was born till his last day he fights with the debalancing cataclysms.All the known pharmakopea exist in the human body - it is a system by itselfs. The patch is like a screen that reflects one's health status.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,still the drug or the vaccine to fight the SEB is not invented. There is a danger to human health when the SEB becomes host's essence. The f.virus contaminates the emotional assessment,which like a ruffled mirror reflects the incoming emotional values feelings like agression,envy,hatread, jealousy,indifference,addictional to alkohol, drugs,gambling,lonelines and pathology like diabetes,AIDS,cancer,cirrhosis, etc - the list could be quite long.There are different medical brands,fighting to balance the existing total disbalance.</p>
<p>For better clarity in determing the degree of contamination the following levels of SEB are distinguished:</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
					Humans,trying to get into conflict at first opportunity, or that are impartial to the suffiring of the surrounding people.The most typical feelings of these people are agression, hatred,jealiusy, greediness.The patch is light pink in colour,small in siza, andvery dangerous to to the host himself and to the surrounding.Family quarrels, cold blooded and cruel murders, divorces, etc. are due to the fighting hormons in the blood and cells of the host.We observe these people not as defendants,but as victims.Of course according to the law, everybody is responsible for his own actions.The people at 1-st level are most dangerous for themselves, and for the society as a whole.Their live is subjected to this plague of 21-st centuary.</p>
<p>Level 2- This level is causing the world economic crisis!<br />
					People that are infected with Level 2 cannot make a reightful assessment of the necessity of the investments for the benefit of the society.If we appoint a Level 2 infected person at leading position at a financial structure,the collaps of the institutiun is immienent. This condition is known as business destroyer.These are people that cannot distinguish between a friendly and enemy hand.Such people have difficulty finding a job, and cannot find their place in prosperous structures, if ultimately they get into such structures, it is for a very short time - 2 - 3 months.The patch is like drops of spray - small, red and very dangerous for the host's business.Such person is better not be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
					This is the level of the addicted to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, etc.These people think that being healthy or not is out of theirmanageability. Is there an alcoholic that considers that alcohol is dangerous to his health? Is there a gambler who does not belive that with the next bid he will get back the lost money, of not today, then tomorrow? The patch is red and big.It is very difficult to get out of this level, and it will long time.Large part of the body is contaminated, and this could be overcome only with relevant therapy and will.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
					This is level of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer high blood pressure, apathy, depression, psoriasis, etc. The patch is very big and pink to purple in colour.People at this level are better strict to medecines an diets, known to the traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Level 5<br />
					Level 5 is litle known, because there is no coming back.The patch is big purple - a warning that death is knocking on the door. Mothers had observed such patch at the back of their children that commited sucide.The patch dissapears 12 hours after death.</p>
<p>It is possible to suffer from chronic illness, without having SEB.It is possible to live the whole live without SEB.The patch is like a screen of the health status that warns, that if body could not cope by itself, it will need appropriate intervention - medical, egological or surgical.Many people live having the patch, but SEB had not turned to be their essence.</p>
<p>When SEB controls the man?</p>
<p>When the emotional perception is constantly distrubed.In a strong way the f.virus modifies the incoming emotional values.It is known, that when the SEB f.virus settles in the limbic system of the Homo Sapiens, it transforms the impulses to the pituitary. In the limbic system are built chains of neurous lymbic ways.Some of them by means of the talamic cores end in the cortex.In such a way the impulses coming from the limbic system are integrated into the nervous system.</p>
<p>Other ways end in the hypotalamic cores.Through the cores the functional influence is transmitted to the cores the functional influience is transmitted to the pituitary gland and to the entire endocrine system. Trough these ways an influence is effected also on the vegetative visceromotor cores.Thus the activity of the limbic system is interconnected with the endocrine orgnas, locomotive organs, the heart. They participate in the emotional behavoir of the individual.</p>
<p>The endocrine glands produce one ore several hormones.By means of blood flow these hormones reach all parts of the body, but effect influence only on some of them. A regulation of the function of the body is effected by means organic substances dispersed in body liquids. The endocrine glands excrete secretion in the blood.They are in close functional connection with the nervons system.When the improper emotional value enters the individual trough the way known to medicine, it is lead to the pituitary gland. The latter signals the the relevant endocrine gland, and in case the individual is contaminated by SEB, a hormonal ingredient is being created, which is of no need to the body in this particular moment.This hormonal substance jams the mitochondrias in the cells with parahormonal substance.</p>
<p>Thus the cell changes its mass.It cannot breathe and capsules itself, and cannot function properly. If this cell happens to be a nevron, pathologic change in the brain could occur, as a result of SEB. By this very mechanism excess quantities enter into mitochondrias of the muscle fibres, the structure of the cells of the locomotive apparatus changes, the structure of the host organs changes.</p>
<p>The foundations of the science called Egology, the studies and fights the SEB for more 24 years,are laid in Bulgaria.In a center Egology, for more 24 years the inflience of SEB is being ignored, more nine thousand photos are made to visualise the SEB. The cell mass of thousands of people is regenerated under a strict medical supervision.

<p>As a 66-year old woman who is conservator for a relative with Alzheimer's and who has watched several other relatives lose their mental faculties and eventually all their other faculties before they died a very long drawn out death, I cannot urge you enough to increase the amount of money spent on research into Alzheimer's and other dementia diseases. Yes, Alzheimer's is devastating to the individual and possibly even more so to the families and caregivers.</p>
<p>When I see that HIV/AIDS research receives about $3 billion from our government whereas Alzheimer's, with 5 times as many affected Americans as there are American HIV patients, even with this new initiative will only get half a billion dollars, I truly don't understand why research into Alzheimer's is so underfunded. I also don't understand why HIV/AIDS patients receive much more government paid assistance than patients with most other diseases. I'm afraid the Alzheimer's lobby has not been vocal enough unlike the HIV/AIDS lobby. But I admire what has been accomplished in making HIV now a treatable chronic illness because of the resources invested in that research.</p>
<p>Don't waste a lot of funding looking for more expensive ways to diagnose Alzheimer's when simple questionnaires and interviews can determine that dementia is present or not. Since dementia is not contagious early diagnosis is only helpful for getting your affairs in order until a viable treatment is discovered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the drugs currently used for Alzheimer's have any long-term benefit and even short-term benefits are questionable. Basic research into what causes or leads to Alzheimer's is where most of the funding needs to go. Hopefully this could lead to understanding how to avoid Alzheimer's altogether as prevention is always preferable and less expensive than treatment. It is is important to include nutritional supplements such as curcumin and vinpocetine in the research since studies have demonstrated some success with several supplements. Just because they can't be patented by drug companies, not enough money is being spent on their research. How cost effective they would be for both patients and the health care system.</p>
<p>If prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is not found soon the cost to the government will be astronomical in the future, as families have less ability and inclination to care for dementia patients at home. I predict dementia patients will frequently be abandoned so they can receive medicaid-paid nursing home care.</p>
<p>I urge the Alzheimer's plan to be implemented quickly and research funding be increased exponentially.</p>

<p>Just wanted to check this through with you. We know we 'informally' presented our National Task Group in Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices' national report and plan to the Council at its meeting on January 17th, but were concerned that perhaps it was not a formal submission and thus may not warrant distribution to the Council and our intent not recognized in official comments submitted to the Council and the NAPA DHHS team.</p>
<p>If that is the case, please accept this submission (with the NTG report attached) as our 'official' submission to the NAPA process. Our cover note accompanying the dissemination of the document is provided below.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with our effort -- it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Plan on Dementia and Adults with Intellectual Disabilities</strong></p>
<p>The National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices has issued a plan for improving the community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia. "This is an issue that will only grow in intensity and the nation needs to address this challenge head on" said Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy on Developmental Medicine and Dentistry and co-chair of the National Task Group. The Group's report, <em>"'My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports"</em>, summarizes and addresses some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>The report offers recommendations for the improvement of services and suggests that its findings and recommendations be considered and integrated into the reports and plans being developed by the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services -- under the National Alzheimer's Project Act. The report notes that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation.</p>
<p>Dr. Keller said that "families are often the main caregivers for adults with an intellectual disability and when Alzheimer's occurs they are profoundly impacted." Such families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. The report notes that many such families have difficulties in providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes pronounced and care demands overwhelm them.</p>
<p>The report also notes that it is important to recognize signs of dementia-related changes early, and identified an instrument potentially applicable to adults with an intellectual disability. This instrument could also be used for the cognitive assessment provision of the annual wellness visit under the Affordable Care Act. The report recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to identify those adults at-risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment or dementia.</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew P. Janicki, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, the other co-chair, said that "generally there is little information on this issue and much needs to be done to make people more aware of it." He noted that the Group recommended an intensified community education effort to enhance the capabilities of staff, clinicians, community providers, and administrators. Further, education is needed to raise awareness of dementia and how it affects adults with an intellectual disability among families and other caregivers.</p>
<p>The report notes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. The National Task Group wants its report to contribute to the work of the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services. Plans are also in place to produce educational materials, develop guidelines for care, and hold training sessions across the country.</p>
<p>The report and its 'Action Plan' are available at these websites: <a href="http://www.aadmd.org/ntg">http://www.aadmd.org/ntg</a> and <a href="http://www.rrtcadd.org">http://www.rrtcadd.org</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, I wish to be involved in NAPA. I was a television executive, but I barely survived as a caregiver to my (once-adoring) obstinate elderly father and sweet but ailing mother, both with Alzheimer's which went undiagnosed for over a year. But after fighting through the medical system, endless tears, and depleting my parents' life savings and much of my own--I finally figured everything out medically, behaviorally, socially, legally, financially and emotionally. Passion to save others (especially from getting so frustrated they commit elder abuse) resulted in my first book, <strong>ELDER RAGE</strong>, a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, launching the <strong>COPING WITH CAREGIVING</strong> radio show, and becoming an <strong>INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER</strong> (CEU/CMEs) on Alzheimer's. I am compelled to educated on issues that so unnecessarily cost years of my life--and then nearly my life itself when I survived invasive Brst. Cancer. <strong>(Please let me know you received this.)</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of Division 40 (Clinical Neuropsychology) of the American Psychological Association with formal written comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Our purpose in contacting you is to inform you that many of our nearly 5,000 members are licensed healthcare professionals qualified to evaluate and treat persons with Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. Clinical neuropsychologists, through receipt of specialized training in cognitive psychology, psychometric &amp; measurement theory, and brain behavior relations, have long been leaders in developing and investigating valid and reliable measures of cognitive functioning used for assessing and tracking symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Members of our profession have also developed and investigated many of the behavioral interventions currently used for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given our field's interest and experience with Alzheimer's disease we offer the following comments:</p>
<ul><li>We strongly urge you to include in Strategy 1.C the use of neuropsychological measures of cognitive functioning, which thus far remain more sensitive to diagnosis and tracking of Alzheimer's disease symptoms than any of the biomarkers that have been studied.</li>
<li>Neuropsychologists, by virtue of their training in brain-behavior relationships, are uniquely qualified for providing valuable services to patients with Alzheimer's disease and should be recognized among those other professions listed in Strategy 2.A recommended for receipt of expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act.</li>
<li>Practitioners in the field of neuropsychology are often among the first to identify symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's patients and are often involved in planning and advance care counseling. This should be recognized through inclusion of neuropsychologists along with physicians in the activities described in Strategies 2.C and 2.D.</li>
</ul><p>We appreciate this opportunity to clarify the role of clinical neuropsychologists in evaluation and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and would welcome any questions or requests for additional information for this or any other similar national initiatives.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is writing to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in regards to the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. SWHR has key scientific recommendations that it believes the Advisory Council should consider as it is finalizing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>SWHR, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research. SWHR appreciates the work the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) is and will be doing to focus our nation's resources on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain, and the brains of men and women are inherently different. While it is common knowledge that men and women think differently, recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated that the difference goes far beyond thought processes. Sex differences have been observed in the anatomy of the brain, behavioral traits, and in the physiological responses of the nervous system. Differences are also noted in the aging process and for generative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Significant differences have been found in men and women who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine, explained in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that "Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women: up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology, whereas it is found in only 8-10 percent of age-matched women." Abnormalities caused by Alzheimer's disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms for men and women with the disease, which may lead to the need for different treatment decisions.</p>
<p>In October 2011, SWHR hosted a one-day scientific roundtable of experts to discuss what is known about sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. The meeting focused on basic and clinical science perspectives, as well as those of the caregiver, and included input from industry scientists. Participants were asked what research questions needed to be answered for progress to be made in the disease. Key research recommendations from the roundtable are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Research on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease, specifically examining sex differences in the transition from normality to early stages of disease to dementia, and from dementia to outcomes.</li>
<li>Research on the influence of sex steroids, bioenergetic vulnerabilities, synaptic function, and cognition in the brain as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Re-examination of existing data for potential sex differences to help define the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and publishing sex-specific results.</li>
<li>Research on the differential impact of the caregiving role on men and women and design interventions to provide more effective services</li>
</ul><p>From the meeting it was clear that research on Alzheimer's disease must account for sex as a basic biological variable and include sex-specific analyses. This type of analysis would be an extremely useful component of a national strategic plan to combat Alzheimer's disease. Approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women, which is why it is extremely important to ensure that the clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent, manage and treat Alzheimer's disease include an adequate number of women within their study population to perform a sex-specific analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR strongly encourages that these recommendations be incorporated in the Framework goals and strategies and be a part of the continued discussions and work of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>In addition, SWHR would like to provide comment on several of the specific goals and strategies. Strategy 1.B states that, "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions." SWHR agrees and advocates for appropriate representation in clinical research based on the disease prevalence in the population, with the specific goal of enrolling sufficient numbers of men and women to achieve statistical significance in the resulting sex-specific data analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR believes that under Strategy 1.C, identifying early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease requires knowing whether there are any particular differences evident based on sex, race, age, or ethnicity. The reporting and analysis of such data should be a part of the strategy even if the results show no difference, as that is important to determine.</p>
<p>In Strategy 1.E, SWHR recommends amending the draft to require the reporting and analysis of sex, race, age and ethnicity in the research findings, as these factors directly impact the quality of the findings disseminated into medical practice. The reporting of these differences, or lack thereof, influences the knowledge and identification of disease by the public health system, including patients and caregivers.</p>
<p>The quality and efficiency of care under Goal 2 would be increased by the measurement of sex and gender differences as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. SWHR further recommends that gender be a part of the timely and accurate diagnosis strategy of 2.B as well as education and support to patients in Strategy 2.C. The more accurate and informative the information that is provided to patients, family members and care givers, the more likely it will be that they understand and are able to be engaged in medical decision making.</p>
<p>As women age, many experience comorbid illnesses and diseases, making the coordination of care even more critical. Strategy 2.F is critically important as, "coordinating care...can help reduce duplication and errors and improve outcomes," especially for those patients, particularly women with multiple chronic diseases. Coordinated care will also help to lessen the difficulty of decisions made by many women who are responsible for making the majority of healthcare decisions for their household.</p>
<p>While SWHR believes that the groups mentioned in Strategy 2.G are unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease, we feel that it is important to include women who are disproportionately affected in general as well as within these subgroups. We recommend that women be added as a subgroups being disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer's disease. It is known that approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women. Moreover, there is a need to examine the data by sex within each population identified in Strategy 2.G, including within racial and ethnic minorities</p>
<p>While SWHR agrees that information and training should be given to caregiver in a culturally sensitive manner, as stated in Strategy 3.A, it is important to note that this information should include information on sex and gender differences, as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. Providing caregivers with any information available on these differences would allow them to better support and care for persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In Goal 4, SWHR believes that the public would benefit from being provided with Alzheimer's disease facts and information specified by sex, race, and ethnicity. This will help ensure that they have all available knowledge, including information to address the widespread confusion and misconceptions surrounding Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the disease will allow for the development of more effective preventions, diagnostic tools and treatments through support of the general public.</p>
<p>Data are an essential element of all research and a critical component to the advancement of our knowledge of sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. SWHR is delighted to see that in Goal 5 there will be, "efforts to expand and enhance data infrastructure and (to) make data easily accessible to federal agencies and other researcher." SWHR would like to see that data include information on differences that may exist between sex, age, race, ethnicity and culture and that it is made accessible to the public in order to advance research, treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease . from patients to caregivers to families.</p>
<p>SWHR believes the recommendations and comments it has provided to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services will help to advance more targeted therapies in Alzheimer's disease for both men and women. This will lead to a greater understanding of risk factors for both men and women and more sex-specific treatment of cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>Should the Advisory Council have any questions or would like more information please contact me.</p>

<p>Please find attached feedback from the Lewy Body Dementia Association on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The letter is from the President of LBDA's Board of Directors, Angela Herron, in consultation with our <strong>Scientific Advisory Council</strong>.</p>
<p>I have also copied the text itself below for your convenience in including it on the NAPA website.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>An Open Letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<br />
					Feedback on the Draft Framework for the<br />
					National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) supports and applauds the development of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.</p>
<p>With appreciation for the magnitude of the task at hand and the complexity of the issues, LBDA is providing limited feedback that is a) relevant for dementia in general and b) an important consideration specific to the spectrum of Lewy body dementias (LBD): dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).</p>
<p>An estimated 1.3 million Americans have LBD, which features progressive dementia plus varying combinations of symptoms (especially at onset), ranging from parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations, to REM sleep behavior disorder, a severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications, mood disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Both clinical diagnoses within the LBD spectrum feature Lewy body pathology, but the timing and severity of symptom onset differs.</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies represents approximately 20 percent of all dementias and is the most frequent dementia type misdiagnosed clinically, most often as Alzheimer's. Features that differentiate LBD from Alzheimer's at the early stage include visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder and results of neuropsychological assessment.</p>
<p>Most older adults with Parkinson's disease have some degree of cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 80% of people with Parkinson's will ultimately develop dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease has not yet become common knowledge among clinicians. There is no general public awareness about dementia in Parkinson's disease. Caregivers of people with PDD report to LBDA that the progression to dementia ultimately proves to be their most difficult caregiving challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It's not always Alzheimer's. </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the importance of communicating the plan in a manner that is both straightforward and understandable by the general public. While Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, there are millions of Americans whose lives are deeply affected by related disorders like stroke, LBD and frontotemporal degeneration; while they receive nominal mention in the background material as being included in this plan, there is no mention of them in the draft agenda.</p>
<p>Public awareness and education is one of the core goals of the draft agenda. LBDA urges the names of related disorders be included in the opening statement of the draft agenda, so that educating the public about the most common forms of dementia begins now and continues throughout the advancement of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, through public relations efforts of federal agencies, disease advocacy organizations and academia.</p>
<p>As the plan receives coverage in the media, deliberate inclusion of related disorders will also minimize disenfranchisement of Americans affected by lesser-known, non-Alzheimer's dementias like LBD, many of whom might easily infer the omission indicates the federal government does not appreciate that their plight is as fraught with burden as those dealing with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<p>While improving the timeliness of diagnosis is important, the Lewy Body Dementia Association strongly recommends the inclusion of the word 'differential' when referring to diagnosis.</p>
<p>A general dementia diagnosis or an inaccurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease leaves people with LBD at risk for exposure to potentially severe or irreversible medication side effects. (Approximately 50% of people with DLB who are exposed to neuroleptics will experience a severe reaction.) Inaccurate diagnosis also prevents the opportunity to prepare families for the complexity of LBD symptoms, treatment and high toll of LBD caregiving. Accurate differential diagnosis not only leads to more appropriate therapeutic interventions but also improves the selection for study candidates in research trials.</p>
<p>Primary care physicians must become more familiar with the top four causes of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's, LBD, stroke and frontotemporal degeneration. Delayed or inaccurate diagnoses are further compounded by the low percentage of referrals from primary care physicians to specialists. Simple screening tools to highlight when a referral is warranted for differential diagnosis are urgently needed, especially for people with LBD.</p>
<p><strong>Care Quality </strong></p>
<p>When assessing the care needs of persons with dementia, it is essential to look beyond the cognitive deficits and their impact on employment, incidental activities of daily living and activities of daily living. In the case of Lewy body dementias, care quality must also address motor symptoms (such as the risk of falls), behavioral problems, sleep and autonomic issues. Other professionals who regularly provide care for people with dementia include specialists treating sleep and autonomic symptoms as well as physical, occupational and speech therapists.</p>
<p><strong>Care Guidelines across Care Settings </strong></p>
<p>Given the increased rate of hospitalization of people with dementia, hospitals should be included in the list of care settings for which dementia care guidelines and measures are to be developed. Many hospitals are not equipped to provide adequate care to people with dementia, especially those with behavioral problems, leading to excessive or avoidable treatment with antipsychotic medications. (This is especially dangerous to the person with LBD, who may experience modest to significant decline without a return to their baseline from as little as a single dose of haloperidol.) Additionally, consideration should be given to non-cognitive symptoms, such as motor problems, which affect activities of daily living and increase fall risk.</p>
<p>As LBD is a multi-system disorder, routine care coordination between multiple physicians is particularly challenging with LBD. By changing medications without consulting the treating neurologist, another physician may unknowingly exacerbate any one of several LBD symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>In addressing the long term care needs of people with dementia, caregivers need more accessible resources to provide quality care for the person with dementia in their own home as long as possible, while also maintaining balance of the equally important quality of life for the family caregiver.</p>
<p>Patient advocacy groups should be included in the draft framework as an important source of counseling, support and information to patients and families upon a differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness </strong></p>
<p>The general public needs to be educated about the difference between dementia and the disease processes that cause it, much like the education the public received about HIV and AIDS. Few people understand that dementia is sometimes treatable. Educating the public that dementia is a symptom requiring medical attention, not a disease in itself, will help de-stigmatize both dementia and the many related clinical diagnoses.</p>
<p>In order to improve the reporting to physicians of all dementia-related symptoms beyond memory problems alone, such as those seen in stroke and LBD, it is imperative that the general public learn that the most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, stroke and LBD, and what symptoms should be reported to their physicians.</p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association is encouraged at the expansive nature of this draft agenda, especially as it pertains to the impact of dementia disorders not just on the patient but on the family caregiver as well. We look forward to following the progression of your work with great anticipation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>Charlie Glabe (University of California Davis)</td>
<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding.

Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions.

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>

<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p>In my opinion (which is based on years of working in the field of dementia with geriatric psychiatrists) your focus on Alzheimer's Disease is too limited to be useful to those elders who have other forms of dementia. Science tells us that there is more than one form of dementia. Alzheimer's is cortical related dementia, where visuospatial praxis declines, whereas vascular dementia can affect many other parts of the brain, producing executive function decline, depression, and other limiting behavioral changes such as disinhibition on one pole and apathy on the other. Some of these less well known effects of dementia underlie self-neglect, hoarding, inability to drive safely, and suicide.</p>
<p>We should examine the circuits in the brain, localize the likely causes of dementia through MRIs and fMRIs and address them more broadly in any National plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New Study Challenges Accepted Approaches to Research in Senile Dementia (Alzheimer's Disease)<br />
					Published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>Amsterdam, NL, 7 November 2011 -- Impacting millions of families and devouring billions of dollars globally, Alzheimer's disease is the focus of exhaustive research to find a cure. Although intensely investigated over the last three decades using cutting-edge technologies, the "pathogenic cause" of Alzheimer's disease has not been found. While many research "breakthroughs" have been claimed and high-profile drugs trials carried out, why does the promised "cure" still seem to elude scientists?</p>
<p>In an effort to address this question, Ming Chen, PhD, Huey T. Nguyen, BS, and Darrell R. Sawmiller, PhD, Aging Research Laboratory, R&amp;D Service, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System and University of South Florida, undertook an independent and systematic analysis of the underlying research assumptions against the established scientific principles. This analysis led them to hypothesize that perhaps the main problem is the research community's perception of the disease.</p>
<p>In an article scheduled for publication in the December issue of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</em> the authors suggest that when the National Institutes of Health separated out dementia from other senile conditions and redefined it as a distinct and "curable" disease -- Alzheimer's -- in the 1970s, it opened a Pandora's box and may have misdirected research for decades. It triggered the search for pathogenic factors and cures, and disregarded the role of demographic change and its diverse end results in the elderly.</p>
<p>The authors argue that senile disorders -- diseases occurring after age 60 and eventually affecting the majority of the elderly, such as tooth, hearing or memory loss -- are caused by aging, thus differ fundamentally from distinct diseases by origin, study paradigm and intervention strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors contend that a central regulator in cognition - the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling system - has been misconceived by institutional thinking that favors a "cure" for senile dementia. The dominant hypothesis, although unproven, is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels rise throughout the aging process, leading to cell death, and thus research has focused on calcium antagonists to lower those levels. This viewpoint has been promoted by policy makers, and the subject of a number of high profile clinical trials, but to date no positive results have emerged.</p>
<p>In contrast, the authors propose that declining functionality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a result of the aging process, among a myriad of other age-related changes, leads to cognitive decline. Therefore interventions for senile dementia could activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> function by promoting energy metabolism and also by Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists such as caffeine and nicotine. At the same time, risk factors play a key role. "Aging and Ca<sup>2</sup>+ deficits set the stage for senile dementia, but do not always lead to senile dementia in real life," explains Dr. Chen. "Lifestyles and other risk factors are the key. So we think that senile dementia may be explained by 'advanced aging plus risk factors.' This model points to a new direction for prevention. This means we must support the elderly in healthy lifestyles. And we should develop medications to extend the lifespan of old neurons, rather than looking for ways to inhibit far-fetched 'pathogenic' factors."</p>
<p>"The model implies that senile dementia is, by and large, a lifestyle disease," says Dr. Chen. "This view, in fact, has been shared by many in the medical and clinical community, but contrasts sharply with current dominant theories in the Alzheimer research field, which assume a linear and 'cause and effect' mechanism. Since they have not taken into account the fundamental roles of aging and risk factors, it is clear that these theories, though highly appealing to the public and researchers alike, are of little relevance to the scientific nature of senile dementia."</p>
<p>"The two overwhelming concepts, senile dementia as a distinct disease and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload hypothesis, have effectively blocked any meaningful progress in senile dementia research, and have inhibited the self-correcting mechanism of science," concludes Dr. Chen. "An independent scrutiny on the field may be helpful."</p>
<p>"Although incurable", Dr. Chen is optimistic. "Our research, if guided by correct theories, will produce medications to help delay dementia to a certain extent - similar to the drugs that delay or ameliorate atherosclerosis and osteoporosis today."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer Disease Comments from the Professional Affairs &amp; Information Committee National Academy of Neuropsychology</strong></p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN). NAN is a professional association with 3,500 members dedicated to the advancement of neuropsychology as a science and health profession. The majority of our members provide direct care to individuals who suffer from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, and many other neurological disorders. Our members work in many medical settings, interface closely with other medical and mental health specialties, and receive referrals from neurologists, physiatrists, neurosurgeons, oncologists, radiologists, family physicians, pediatricians, and many other healthcare professionals. We have expertise in the evaluation of normal and abnormal brain functioning, and our assessments are utilized in complementary fashion to neuroimaging and other neurodiagnostic activities. In addition to our work as diagnosticians, clinical neuropsychologists are actively involved in the research, diagnosis, and treatment/management of persons suffering Alzheimer's dementia and in supporting their caregivers (including educating and counseling loved ones, and consulting with staff in assisted living and long term care facilities).</p>
<p>NAN applauds your efforts to aggressively address Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this process. We have reviewed the HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer Disease and have the following comments that we hope will help facilitate your efforts in this regard.</p>
<p>Comments/Suggestions:</p>
<p>General: The language of the document is almost entirely directed toward physicians. Clinical neuropsychology offers its services as researchers and clinicians to the cause of addressing the burden of AD on patients and caregivers.</p>

<p>Please consider adding sensitive neuropsychological measures to this section in support of the biological measures. While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data.<sup>1,2</sup></p>

</ol><p>				Neuropsychologists have developed very sensitive neurocognitive test measures that can be used along with biological measures to help characterize early, subtle symptoms of AD, which can then be used to stage neurocognitive decline and/or the effectiveness of experimental biological and/or behavioral interventions for AD. The above citations support the conclusion that neurocognitive assessment is the most effective means of measuring disease progression and functional status.</p>
<p>Goal 2, Strategy 2.A, &amp; Strategy 2.D: Mentions healthcare providers except neuropsychologists and psychologists.</p>
<p>Please consider mentioning neuropsychologists along with other care providers. Neuropsychologists provide a high quality of care and service to patients with dementing conditions and to their families and other caregivers.</p>
<p>Strategy 2.B: States "Research has helped identify some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease...(citation #5)."</p>
<p>Citation #5 (Jack et al., 2011, above) does not mention specific assessment tools, but assessment of cognition and function are hallmarks of the practice of neuropsychology. Please consider mentioning that neuropsychologists can be useful in the administration and interpretation of cognitive and functional assessment measures, and assisting in the accurate diagnosis of AD.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated by when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients as well as other factors. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Thank you for accepting comments on the draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>As a rhythm facilitator with a good deal of experience in elder care, I have often noticed that people experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease strongly gravitate toward any rhythm experience. The research indicates that Alzheimer's causes the brain to lose its sequencing function to a greater degree with time. The research also indicates that the experience of making or participating in rhythm helps the brain coherently sequence events.</p>
<p>This seems to be the initial draw for patients with Alzheimer's. I have heard many of them comment to the effect that participating in rhythm events helps these people "feel normal again," as they usually put it. I find that they will attend rhythm-making events even when most other activities lose their interest.</p>
<p>Rhythm-making in a group also provides multi-faceted wellness opportunities for people with Alzheimer's in all seven dimensions of wellness, as formally defined by the International Council on Active Aging:</p>
<p>Physical exercise<br />
					Intellectual stimulation<br />
					Social interaction<br />
					Emotional expression<br />
					Spiritual connection<br />
					Occupational satisfaction<br />
					Environmental awareness of surroundings</p>
<p>Rhythm is innate to all humans, and when motor or brain functions begin to falter, normal respiration, pulse, and heart rate can be stabilized and strengthened by the artful use of rhythmic activity.</p>
<p>Much store has been put in the efficacy of computer programs to boost brain efficiency. While brain efficiency is important, it is not the only aspect of being human that matters. Brain efficiency directly depends on the function level of all the body systems. We must stop treating humans as simply brains supported by a superfluous body structure. To retain quality of life, and indeed the quality of humanness itself, all the dimensions of wellness must be addressed together.</p>
<p>I hope you will consider inserting a recomendation for social rhythm-making in your final protocol for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Thank you for accepting my comments.</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Comment: Often Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias relate to a long continuum of treatment, home care and hospitalization. Upon review of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, I find a lack of related concern for the spiritual needs of both patients and family members/caregivers. On the multiple pages of the document I find no reference to spiritual care or an assessment of the spiritual need of the patient/caregiver.</p>
<p>Frequently a patient and his/her related caregiver(s) have a relationship to a church, mosque, synagogue, or other spiritual connection. When they do not, they may move into a long period when high-quality professionals with appropriate skill do not assess nor address their spiritual needs. Referral to a professional chaplain trained in spiritual care with patients and caregivers is a necessity for high-quality care.</p>
<p>Professional practitioners are encouraged in medical literature to take a spiritual history. Christina M. Pulchalski, MD., George Washington Institute of Spirituality and Health suggests that medical caregivers address a patient's faith, belief and meaning in life, the importance and influence of spirituality, the spiritual or religious community with which the patient connects, and how the health care provider might address spiritual issues in the course of the patient's health care.</p>
<p>I suggest specifically in Goal 2 and Strategy 3.A., references for referral to professional spiritual care providers and the creation of suitable spiritual suggestions that may be included after taking a spiritual history of the patient/caregiver especially at key points of treatment -- at diagnosis, upon true onset of symptoms, at hospitalization, institutionalization and especially anticipating end of life.</p>
<p>I suggest in <strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, paragraph 1.</p>
<p>"Providing all people with Alzheimer's disease with the high-quality care in the most efficient manner requires a multi-tiered approach. High quality care requires an adequate supply of professionals with appropriate skills, ranging from direct-care worker to community health and social workers/spiritual care providers to primary care providers and specialists. . ."</p>
<p>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</p>
<p>"Caregivers report that they feel unprepared for some of the challenges of caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease -- for example, caring for a loved one with sleep disturbances, behavioral changes, or in need of physical assistance can be an enormous challenge. Giving caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner helps them better prepare for these and other challenges. Examples of potential actions under this strategy include identifying the areas of training and educational needs, identifying and creating emotionally supportive, spiritually suitable, and culturally-appropriate materials. The assessment of spiritual needs, the distribution of appropriate materials to caregivers, and the use of information technology is needed to support persons with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers."</p>
<p><strong>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p><strong>Draft Framework </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is now available. The draft framework is structured around five ambitious goals:</p>
<ul><li>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025.</li>
<li>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency.</li>
<li>Expand Patient and Family Support.</li>
<li>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement.Track Progress and Drive Improvement.</li>
</ul><p>HHS is seeking input on the draft framework including Goals and Strategies and additional ideas that would inform the development of an action plan.</p>
<p>Please note that throughout the draft framework, the term "Alzheimer's disease," or AD, refers to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, consistent with the approach Congress used in the National Alzheimer's Project Act. Unless otherwise noted, in this draft framework AD refers to these conditions collectively.</p>
<p>HHS will be collecting input through <strong>February 8, 2012</strong>. Please send your comments to NAPA@hhs.gov. All comments will be shared with the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>It must be mandatory that all health care professionals who work in nursing homes, assisted living, CCRC, adult day care, hospice agencies, home care agencies, hospitals, senior living communities and any other setting that provides services to the geriatric population receive at minimum of 8 hours of "LIVE" Alzheimer's and dementia education by certified Alzheimer's and dementia trainers.</p>
<p>There must be continued ongoing education through out the year once they have received the initial training that deals with new advances, regulatory changes, culture change and abuse / neglect concerns.</p>
<p>The state regulations for dementia education is different in each state and for each type of service industry. Care providers, front line staff and health care professionals must all receive a minimum of 8 hours of live Alzheimer's and dementia education and ongoing Alzheimer's and dementia education to insure competent and compassionate care. There are currently no national standards. The new federal standard being considered <strong>should not target</strong> one specific profession but must be all inclusive and include all health care professionals and front line staff who work with the geriatric population.</p>
<p>It must be mandated at the federal level so that all states are in compliance with mandatory live dementia education. Further more, all First Responders which includes Law Enforcement EMT's and Fire Fighters also receive comprehensive Alzheimer's dementia education. As they come face to face with the geriatric population in their community but are ill equipped due to lack of Alzheimer's and dementia education to deal with concerns affecting the geriatric populations such as recognizing abuse / neglect in the home, driving concerns in the elderly. aggressive behaviors and elopement. Profit and not for profit companies and organizations should be included in a list of organizations and companies who offer live dementia education. There should be a national list of companies who can offer these services. The list should <strong><em>not be regulated</em></strong> nor designed for non profit training organizations but include for profit companies as well. Health Care organizations, First Responders and companies should have the option to pick and choose which organization they wish to utilize to provide live dementia education to their staff.</p>
<p>The initial live Alzheimer's Dementia education should be live training provided by live instructors who are certified Alzheimer's and dementia trainers vs utilizing video and online Alzheimer's and dementia training to insure that the health care professional and front line staff understands the material. It is critical that they be given the opportunity to interact with the instructor, ask questions and be provided the opportunity to discuss issues and concerns they may have. This can not happen with videos and online training. We respect this option for education for ongoing education through out the year but not in place of the initial live training.</p>
<p>The National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners provides live Alzheimer's and dementia education as well as dementia certification to front line staff, health care professionals, dementia unit managers and First Responders. The National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners also provides train the trainer and certifies trainers as Certified Alzheimer's and Dementia Trainer and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainer who in turn utilize current and most up to date NCCDP curriculum.</p>

<p>I applaud the committee for beginning this effort to eliminate Alzheimer's Disease AND to support patients and their caregivers who are currently dealing with this devastating disease. I am a professional in the aging field with over 20 years experience in caregiver support and training as well as supervision of In-Home Aides. I also cared for my mother in my home for 4 years before she went to a nursing home for the last two months of her life, so I can speak from a professional AND a caregiver point of view.</p>
<p>By way of supporting the current caregivers and patients I see a big need for <strong>training</strong> for facility and home care staff, especially line staff in how to deal with Alzheimer's patients and the sometimes challenging behaviors they exhibit. I see a need for facilities (nursing homes or assisted living primarily, but also hospitals) to train staff in dealing with family caregivers as care partners rather than as peripheral entities. Much lack of adequate care could be avoided by clearer communication and understanding what is happening with the patient in terms of the disease.</p>
<p>There is also a HUGE need for <strong>funding for such training, for hiring more line staff in facilities, and for providing respite for family caregivers</strong> so that they can continue to do the wonderful job they do. Without adequate funding, all the "frameworks" in the world won't make a dent in the root issue. I've seen the Family Caregiver Support Program languish for 10 years now at nearly static funding levels (which is of course going backward since costs are NOT static). The Lifespan Respite program was widely applauded and has lofty goals, but has yet to see any real funding. Caregivers are tired of hearing Congress and federal/state agencies say to them, "oh, it's so wonderful what you do and we want to support you, but there's no money so here's a proclamation (or in this case a "framework") instead."</p>
<p>Again, what you have done thus far is admirable and a good first step. Now let's try to make a difference to real people on the front lines with funding to back it up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Are dental X-rays causing Alzheimer's disease?</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Caroline Rodgers. I am a researcher and writer specializing in public health issues.</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone here would agree that Alzheimer's disease has turned the prospect of aging into a scary and uncertain future that will rob many of us of our memories, our dignity and even our lives. I am here because I envision a world in which Alzheimer's is once again a rarity and our senior years are a true Golden Age.</p>
<p>Last year my article proposing that dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease was published in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses<sup>1</sup>. I also made a poster presentation on the subject at the 2011 Alzheimer's Association International Conference<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The technical explanation of my hypothesis is:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ionizing radiation from dental X-rays shortens the telomeres of microglia, which are critical to maintaining neuronal health. This reduces the lifespan of microglia, stranding neurons. Stranded neurons subsequently die, causing irreversible dementia. </strong></em></p>
<p>More simply stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>Head exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is causing us to outlive the brain cells designed to support our neurons all lifelong. </strong></em></p>
<p>NOTE: Dental X-rays are the only form of ionizing radiation that virtually all Americans are routinely exposed to at regular intervals throughout their entire lives, starting in early childhood. Although low-dose ionizing radiation amounts have been compared to background radiation exposure received during long airline flights, the amount of whole-body ionizing radiation received cannot be fairly compared to the amount beamed directly into the head.</p>
<p>It is not realistic to believe that decades of dental X-ray exposure would be without consequence for all people. The question is not, "Why should we consider whether dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's," but rather, "Why didn't we think of this sooner?"</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis foundation: </strong></p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's prevalence data</li>
<li>Population-based dental care information</li>
<li>Scientific studies<sup>1-4</sup></li>
</ol><p><strong>Dental care &amp; dementia: A sampling of countries </strong></p>
<p>INDIA</p>
<p>67% have never visited a dentist<sup>5 </sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence estimated at 1/5 -1/4 that of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>CHINA</p>
<p>30% to 43% adults have never visited a dentist<sup>7</sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence about half of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>UNITED STATES</p>
<p>1% have never visited a dentist<sup>8</sup><br />
					13% of people 65 and older have AD<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>Let's test this hypothesis against the facts </strong></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The emergence of AD symptoms is delayed 10 or more years following the presence of AD brain pathology.</p>
<p>Microglial telomere shortening would have a delayed effect on neurons because it reduces microglial lifespan, not function.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD mortality increased rapidly after 1979, making it the sixth leading cause of death by 2000.</p>
<p>Since AD symptoms are delayed by 10 or more years, it is worthwhile to look at health trends taking place in the decades before the surge in AD mortality. This was a time of major changes in the nation's dental health habits.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong> it wasn't until the '40s that X-ray machines were common in America's dental offices<sup>10</sup>. However, nearly two decades later, in 1954 . . .<br /><strong>1957</strong> only 37% had visited a dentist within the year, while 18% reported never visiting a dentist<sup>11</sup>.<br /><strong>2008</strong> 59% had visited a dentist within the year, with only 1% never having visited a dentist<sup>8</sup>.<br /><strong>2010</strong> The national average that had been to a dentist or dental clinic within the year was 69.7%<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to suffer AD-related damage.</p>
<p>It contains both microglia and neural progenitor cells which -unlike other mature brain cells -- keep dividing, making them more susceptible to radiation-induced damage.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Men die sooner than women following an AD diagnosis<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Older men have shorter telomeres than women the same age<sup>13</sup>, so they would have less time if their microglia telomeres were prematurely shortened.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Virtually all people with Down syndrome have AD brain pathology by age 40 -- but there is a wide variance in the onset of dementia<sup>14,15</sup>.</p>
<p>People with Down syndrome lose telomere length faster than the general population, but just like others, there is variation in newborn telomere length<sup>16,13</sup>. Also, people with Down syndrome are subject to many genetic dental anomalies that could entail additional X-ray exposure.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD prevalence is higher in urban areas<sup>17</sup>.</p>
<p>City dwellers make more dental visits<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD is increasing most rapidly in developing countries -- especially Latin America<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, many countries started providing free dental care to all citizens, such as Cuba in 1976, Venezuela in 1999 and Brazil in 2004,.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD does not respond to anti-inflammatory or cholesterol-lowering drugs -- even though AD is associated with brain inflammation and high cholesterol<sup>19,20</sup> .</p>
<p>Neither treatment can help neurons that have lost their support system.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Mentally stimulating activities initially delay AD, yet ultimately accelerate it<sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>Additional brain growth would eventually overwhelm microglia struggling to support existing neuronal networks.</p>
<p><strong>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's, it raises new questions and concerns, such as:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Could diligent dental care explain the increase in non-familial early-onset AD?</li>
<li>At what price, a smile: What are the long-term risks for orthodontia patients exposed to cone-beam CT scanners that create 3-D images -- at much higher radiation levels?</li>
<li>Could head X-rays after sports injuries contribute to early-onset dementia?</li>
<li>If dental X-rays pose risks, could brain imaging utilizing ionizing radiation to monitor AD accelerate disease progression?</li>
<li>Do plateaus in declining cognition relate to intervals between X-ray exposures?</li>
<li>Could the ratio of dental professionals to population be used to create accurate algorithms to predict dementia trends?</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are the prospects for Alzheimer's prevention, treatment or cure? </strong></p>
<p>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease, future cases can be decreased by eliminating or strictly limiting dental X-rays. Dentists can also turn to alternative imaging technologies already developed, yet not in common use. Interventions for people already exposed to dental X-rays yet without AD symptoms could include developing ways to safely transplant self-donated bone marrow or dental stem cells to replenish microglia populations. Other possibilities would be to develop ways to preserve or even lengthen microglia telomere length or to selectively remove permanently senescent microglia cells to stimulate replacement microglia that would actively provide neuroprotection. Sadly, there is no evident cure for people who have already lost their microglial support system to the point where enough neurons have died to cause symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Closing comments </strong></p>
<p>I don't know the answer to the questions I have raised in this short talk. I do, however, know that we have to look in new places with open minds to solve the puzzle of AD's emergence as a major killer and to restore health, dignity and luster to our "golden years."</p>

<p>The following are comments left by my readers regarding the draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Thank you for developing this plan and soliciting feedback!</p>
<p>(1) Jim says:</p>
<p>Back in 1961 president John F. Kennedy made a commitment of going to the moon. Then in 1969 NASA accomplish that goal, so if you do the math it only took about 8 years. Why does the government feel it would take only13 years to find a cure for Alzheimers? The drug industry have tried for years.in finding a cure. Meanwhile, the skilled nursing homes are being filled with dementia/Alzheimers victims in different stages that either end up dying of malnutrition or pneumonia. The disease is rapidly growing out of control as we are living longer.I fear the time to address this problem has already passed.</p>

					(2) C. Danesi says:</p>
<p>Its up to us as the americans who are caregivers for those afflicted to get involved with the council and help drive their progress so that it wont take 13 more years.i arranged care for my mom who has severe alzheimers and traveled to Washington to be involved with the councils first meeting.im on a limited budget.We can make this happen-We must!thankyou carla danesi glorias daughter "remember gloria,gloria lives"</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 5:10 pm<br />
					(3) T. Litz says:</p>
<p>In an effort to help people with Alzheimer's and their families the government should help financially by adding to medicare a provision to help pay for care givers, The cost of care is outragious. In the beginning some care and then 24/7. Nursing home options are just as expensive and take the quality of life away from individuals with dementia. When there is no money left and medicaid is the only option left the government intervenes. Then the Alzheimer's person has to have all their caregiver's changed to an approved medicaid agency. This change alone is frightening for the family and changes the relationships built up over years with private caregivers. My mother has had Alzheimer's for 9 years so far. Benefits from the VA have not been forthcoming for almost a year and seem almost unreachable. More documentation, more waiting and never an answer as to when her aide and attendance benefits will start or if she will ever even receive it. My father was a VET from World War II. I call the VA every 2 weeks and get no where. More documentation -the application was filed last Febuary and now almost a year later they are asking for more information/ medical information faxed 3 weeks ago and now they want financial documentation. It seems that they are waiting for my mom to die. Advocate all the time and get no where.</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 6:45 pm<br />
					(4) K. Lockhart says:</p>
<p>Besides the research that needs more money for this disease, medicare and other insurance companies need to support care in the home 24/7. My 83 year old mother can not do it for my dad who is 84. We have needed in home care for that past 2.5 years. We have been fortunate to afford the care so far but it isn't going to last. I do NOT want to put my father in a nursing home that still does not know how to care for Alzheimer or any other dementia patient.</p>
<p>Changes in the healthcae system to prepare and regulate whether or not they are in fact providing best practices for these patients is important. Without government interventions, families struggle inordinately financially, emotionally, and physically. The caregiving will kill my mom before anything else. Unless I quit my job to help, I can only do the weekends. Isn't it cheaper to keep him at home than place him?? Looks that way to me. Thanks, Kathy</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 11:16 pm<br />
					(5) M. Brennan says:</p>
<p>To prevent Alzheimer's disease, let's consider how people in countries with little Alzheimer's disease live (differences in diet? stress? sleep? environment? other differeces from us?)</p>
<p>Let's assure funding for any reasonable research proposal that could help prevent or delay Alzheimer's. The federal deficit is no excuse for skimping on this urgent need. The deficit will be far greater if we don't prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 12:38 am<br />
					(6) M. Monfredo says:</p>
<p>I will echo what others have said in regard to the need to fund home caregiving through a medicare provision. The cost of hiring someone from outside for even one day a week is prohibitively expensive for many families. It's far less expensive to society overall for Alzheimer's patients to remain in their homes and this fact should be reflected in financial relief to their primary caregivers. Until a cure is found, this financial need will become even more acute in our aging population.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 6:29 am<br />
					(7) T. Mumby says:</p>
<p>I know it fantastically difficult for all of us to STOP, turn around, see the person with dementia as OUR teacher and learn what changes we have to make in ourselves to promote well-being in our lives.</p>
<p>Seeing our loved one as a SICK PATIENT compounds the agony.</p>
<p>How many more trillions of dollars will poured into the monster money eating pharmaceutical industry? (Are you watching our financial decline?)</p>
<p>The variety of behavioural challenges is the MAJOR problem.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses and the medical model is for SICK people, not people who are challenging us and our own mental strength 24/7.</p>
<p>It is not really surprising to explain the difficult behaviour around people where dementia is being experienced.</p>
<p>Acute fear, panic, confusion, irrational actions are telling us to LEARN the art of conducting situations in a light creative style. When the lessons are mastered, the progression of dementia is about how well YOU are developing into a wise and kindly person through using your new skills.</p>

<p>Many of us believe that it is very important that the National Alzheimer's Plan address mental health issues in the lives of people with dementia and their family caregivers. That was the gist of the discussion that took place at SAMHSA on December 16 when a group of experts were brought together to provide recommendations for SAMHSA regarding NAPA. This past week I published a short piece in the <em>Huffington Post</em> that elaborated on this position a bit. I would be glad to provide more extensive ideas if that would be useful.</p>
<p>Here is the link to my piece. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-friedman-lmsw/dementia_b_1189082.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-friedman-lmsw/dementia_b_1189082.html</a></p>

<p>People living with Alzheimer's or other dementias often have mental health problems -- especially depression and anxiety disorders -- as well as dementia. Memories they have always relied on become hazy and uncertain. Knowledge and skills cultivated over a lifetime diminish. Relationships change or are lost. Ordinary activities at work, home or leisure become difficult. Eventually, other people may be needed to help manage finances, make plans, get back and forth from home, eat, stay clean or go to the bathroom. As these sources of identity, personal pride and satisfaction are lost, people with dementia can become deeply sad, fearful and/or angry. Sometimes their behavior becomes a challenge for people who care for them.</p>
<p>These obvious facts should be part of what drives our nation's preparation for the vast growth of the number of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias that will take place over the next two decades.</p>
<p>The good news is that pursuant to The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/</a>] signed into law in January 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has begun to develop a long-term plan regarding dementia. The planning advisory committee for this project includes a representative of the Substance Abuse and Services Administration (SAMHSA) as well as representatives of many other federal agencies. In mid-December SAMHSA brought together a small group of experts who recommended that SAMHSA speak to the critical importance of addressing mental health problems experienced by people with dementia, Hopefully, it will do so at the next meeting of the advisory committee, which will take place on Jan. 17 and 18.</p>
<p>That's the good news. The bad news is that there is a battle shaping up about what the nation's priorities regarding dementia should be.</p>
<p>Some argue that there should be one and only one priority -- investing in research to discover a cure for Alzheimer's or at least to invent medications to stop the ineluctable decline the disease brings with it. For example, in an editorial in <em>Alzheimer's and Dementia</em>, Zaven Khachaturian of the Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease by 2020 argues, "Ultimately, the only deliverable that counts is a credible plan of action that calls for significant and systematic increases in the allocation of resources and funds for Alzheimer's research... particularly in the discovery and development of interventions to prevent disability."[1]</p>
<p>Others of us believe that, however promising biomedical research is, it will probably not bring relief in time for the 5.4 million Americans who already have dementia or for the additional five to six million people who will develop dementia over the next two decades. [2] We believe that humane care to help them have the best possible quality of life is the critical goal. We see this not as competing with biomedical research but as work that is necessary in addition to it.</p>
<p>But even among those of us who are focused on the need for more humane and more effective services and supports, there is some dispute about the importance of mental health services.</p>
<p>In part, this is the result of an outmoded view about the separation of mind and body. Dementia has physical roots with mental manifestations. Many advocates for better Alzheimer's care and treatment focus on the physical roots and do not regard dementia as a mental health condition. Others of us believe that mind and body are inextricably intertwined and that both physical and mental health perspectives and interventions are needed to help people with dementia and their families to have the best possible quality of life.</p>
<p>Many mental health issues arise in the lives of people with dementia and their caregivers. In a recent article in the same journal that published Khachaturian's editorial, Constantine Lyketsos and others argue that "neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias." They cite "depression and apathy ... verbal and physical agitation ... [and in later phases] delusions, hallucinations and aggression" as particularly common and important to address with mental health interventions, preferably non-pharmacological interventions. [3]</p>
<p>Psychological understanding can also contribute to improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families even if they do not have diagnosable mental illnesses. Dementia is often thought of as an unmitigated horror, but the truth is that some people with dementia lead lives that they find satisfying. Helping people with dementia to retain a sense of self-worth and be at peace with who they are is a very important goal for them. [4]</p>
<p>Mental health issues also touch family caregivers who provide 80 percent of the care for their relatives with disabilities. They are at high risk for depression, anxiety and physical illnesses that contribute to burn-out. Solid research by Mary Mittelman has shown that psychological support helps family caregivers live better with the stress they face, resulting in delay in nursing home placement by upward of 18 months. [5]</p>
<p>If the National Alzheimer's Plan does not reflect these facts, life for people with dementia and their families will end up far worse than it needs to be. That is why I and many others are advocating [<a href="http://www.imstillhere.org">http://www.imstillhere.org</a>] that the plan establish meeting the mental health needs of people with dementia and their families as a core priority for our nation.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to commend HHS for proactively working towards a comprehensive plan to address the personal and public impact of Alzheimer's disease. This plan is needed to ensure that there is proper allocation of resources to address dementias both empirically and clinically.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that the plan did not mention the field of Psychology. Psychological researchers have played an integral role in the knowledge base on dementias and have developed diagnostic tools which are highly specific, yet cost effective. Furthermore, Psychologists and Neuropsychologists are often called upon to make formal diagnosis of dementia, relay this diagnostic information to patients and families, provide psychoeducation and support, assist with advanced care planning, assist teams/families in identifying and using non-pharmacological strategies for managing difficult behaviors, and provide services at the end-of-life.</p>
<p>As a Psychologist within the VA healthcare system, I provide such services within our Community Living Centers (i.e., nursing homes). Psychologists are specially trained to understand the psychosocial factors impacting older adults, as well as cultural/diversity impacts. As such, Psychologists are poised to deliver high quality assessment and intervention services to persons with dementia and their families. Furthermore, Psychologists have unique skills in assessment and program evaluation which allows us to monitor and measure our work in a way that can be directly linked to cost savings. I have seen how Psychology's presence on the CLCs has led to more positive outcomes, such as the significant reduction of use of antipsychotic medications, reduced caregiver burden, improved mood functioning for patients, and reduced strain on staff.</p>
<p>The exclusion of Psychologists in this framework could have detrimental financial impacts on our ability to provide these services in the future. I strongly believe that the elimination of Psychology from the interdisciplinary teams serving dementia patients would have dire effects on the provision of quality care.</p>
<p>I appreciate your strong consideration of including Psychologists in this framework.</p>

<p>I would like to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD). I appreciate the efforts to develop a national plan for most effectively addressing AD. The overall goals of the Plan are important, but they seem to focus more on medical aspects of dementia and focus little on psychological, behavioral, and functional aspects of dementia. In particular, a greater focus on promoting each of the following is critical for more fully addressing AD and its impact: (1) research and practice related to psychological interventions for managing behavioral sequelae of dementia; (2) research on approaches designed to maximize independence of individuals with dementia, including residing at home (which I think is increasingly going to be the trend in the future); (3) research on and demonstration of innovative care settings for individuals with dementia and severe behavioral or mental health issues. In addition, psychologists are conspicuously absent in the section on building a workforce to provide high quality care to individuals with dementia, though psychiatrists, social workers, neurologists, and others are specified. Psychologists are essential to the assessment and management of AD and many co-occurring conditions and work as core members of interdisciplinary teams in a wide variety of clinical settings that provide care to individuals with AD. Furthermore, in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), psychologists work as integral, full-time members of each (130+) Home Based Primary Care team that provides care to Veterans in their homes, some of which have AD or other forms of dementia. Accordingly, the specification of psychologists in the Plan as an important part of the workforce for effectively treating AD and for focused recruitment efforts is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of these comments.</p>

<p>I am a clinical psychologist with training in gerontology, working within the VA healthcare system as part of the Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) program. HBPC serves a population of chronically ill and disabled Veterans and their families, including many with Alzheimer's Disease, providing services within their home or assisted living facility. This program is a relatively new national initiative within the VA system and has already been shown to meet many of the initial goals for improving care and reducing costs. It is considered cutting-edge health care for this most vulnerable and complex group of patients. In recognition of the value of addressing mental health as well as physical health for these patients, HBPC interdisciplinary teams are mandated to include a full-time mental health provider, which is almost always a PSYCHOLOGIST.</p>
<p>The wide range of expert services that a psychologist can offer to persons dealing with Alzheimer's Disease -- including but not limited to cognitive testing, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric symptoms, caregiver support, and training of families and facility staff -- cannot be duplicated by any other professional discipline. Indeed, psychologists are integral to the clinical care of persons with Alzheimer's Disease, not only in my work setting within the VA, but across the nation in clinic, home, and nursing facility settings. In addition, it goes without saying that much of the most important research in the area of Alzheimer's Disease is conducted by psychologists.</p>
<p>I was shocked when I realized that the words "psychologist" or "psychology" do not appear once in the Draft of the National Plan. Psychologists are not listed as one of the essential disciplines under "Goal 2," though many of the services that we provide are noted as vitally important to focus on in the coming years. I see this as a serious error - not because of my desire to protect the "turf" of psychology, but because it simply does not reflect the reality of healthcare today for persons with Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I urge you to correct this omission and formally recognize the significant role Psychology already plays in the diagnosis and treatment of persons with Alzheimer's Disease. For example, the National Plan should include language to note the importance of supporting training for geropsychologists and funding for psychological services for these persons and their families.</p>

<p>My name is Mary Hogan. I am one of 8 older siblings of the late Bill Hogan. I submit this request to you today, December 30, 2011, in honor of my brother and hopefully for other families who are facing the challenges related to Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In January 2006, at the age of 45, Bill was diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer's type. Over the course of the next 4 years his journey became far more complex. He experienced a very rapid deterioration during the last 13 months of his life and died of chronic aspiration pneumonia on February 25, 2010, two months shy of his 50th birthday. My brother was a member of a subgroup of individuals with Down syndrome that develop AD early, decline rapidly and face a premature death. This has been a great loss for our family and Bill's community at large.</p>
<p>Extraordinary efforts to advocate for Bill were required during the final years of his life. Active advocacy was sometimes lonely and often a frustrating process. Obstacles for advocacy increased significantly after Bill's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Our experience is most likely replicated in other families as well.</p>
<p>I write to you today to request the following considerations for the National Alzheimer Project Act Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services:</p>
<ol><li>People with Intellectual Disabilities, and their caregivers, should be included in future planning with the <strong>same access</strong> to appropriate care and support as individuals in the general population. The growing incidence of Alzheimer's disease will be mirrored in the ID population, most especially with individuals with DS who have a far greater likelihood of developing this insidious disease by age 60. Inclusion in any future planning will be ensure that this often marginalized group will have access to appropriate care across their lifetime.</li>
<li>Most often individuals with ID, including those with DS, are cared for by their families well into their adult lives, often by aging family members. Recognition of the need to enhance support for this group of caregivers will be critical in the future. I ask that NAPA Advisory Council recognize the need for improved dementia care for individuals with intellectual disabilities in conjunction with increased support for family members as caregivers and advocates.</li>
<li>Since individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, families, caregivers, agencies, medical providers and researchers will need to work together to maintain their "quality of life". Families facing DS/AD need access to information about both disease process and advocacy. I suggest a review of what has been produced by Alzheimer's Australia and the Australian government as a sample of what might be provided.</li>
<li>A consortium of providers (i.e. Alzheimer's Association, Health and Human Services, the Administration on Developmental Disabilities or Administration on Aging, UCEDD, families, and advocacy organizations, etc.) should disseminate best practice guidelines related to adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia. This will include training and education for care providers across a multitude of settings. I suggest careful consideration of the forthcoming document produced by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</li>
</ol><p>I am hopeful that in this day of limited funding the needs of <strong>all</strong> people with Alzheimer's disease will be addressed creatively and with the greatest of compassion and that the National Alzheimer Project Act Advisory Council will provide leadership and direction for the future.</p>
<p>I thank you for the considering this request.</p>

<p>The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is writing to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in regards to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). SWHR has key scientific recommendations that it believes the Advisory Council should consider as it is establishing an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>SWHR, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research. SWHR appreciates the work NAPA is and will be doing to focus our nation's resources on Alzheimer's disease. While Alzheimer's disease is a disease of the brain, the brains of men and women are inherently different. It is common knowledge that men and women think differently; however, recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated that the difference goes beyond thought processes. Sex differences have been observed in the anatomy of the brain, behavioral traits, and in the physiological responses of the nervous system to outside stimuli and internal perturbation. These differences are also noted in the aging process and for the degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>SWHR believes that sex differences in Alzheimer's disease are critical to scientific advancements in diagnosing and treating the disease and need to be a part of the plan's scope. In October 2011, SWHR convened a one-day scientific roundtable of experts to discuss what is known about sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease, from both a basic and clinical science perspective as well as those of the caregiver and what research questions needed to be answered for progress to be made in the disease for all who are impacted. From the meeting it was clear that Alzheimer's disease research must account for sex as a basic biological variable and include sex-specific analyses and would be an extremely useful component of a national strategic plan to combat Alzheimer's disease. Key research recommendations from the roundtable that NAPA should include:</p>
<ul><li>Research on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's Disease, specifically examining sex differences in the transition from normality to early stages of disease to dementia, and from dementia to outcomes.</li>
<li>Research on the influence of sex steroids, bioenergetic vulnerabilities, synaptic function, and cognition in the brain as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Re-examination of existing data for potential sex differences to help define the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and publishing sex-specific results.</li>
<li>Research on the differential impact of the caregiving role on men and women and design interventions to provide more effective services</li>
</ul><p>Significant differences exist between men and women who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine, explained in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that "Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women: up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology, whereas it is found in only 8-10 percent of age-matched women." Abnormalities caused by Alzheimer's disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms or behavioral problems for men and women with the disease and may lead to the need for different treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>Biology of Sex Differences (BSD)</em> published research on sex differences of certain brain cells and their response to inflammation in the article, "Sex Differences in the Inflammatory Response of Primary Astrocytes to Lippolysaccharide" on July 12, 2011. Sex differences in incidence, age of onset, symptoms or outcome are evident in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Astrocytes, one of the glial cells of the brain, show sex difference in number of cells, function, and differentiation. Glial cells are involved with physical support for neurons, while others regulate the internal environment of the brain, and provide nutrients to neurons of the brain.</p>
<p>With the increasing number of known sex differences found in research in Alzheimer's disease, SWHR recommends gaining a better understanding of the relationship between pathology and how disease presentation affects men and women differently leading to future sex-specific therapies for the disease.</p>
<p>Through our research recommendations above, SWHR seeks to put before the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services the need to advance more targeted therapies in Alzheimer's disease for both men and women. This will lead to a greater understanding of risk factors for both men and women and more sex specific treatment of cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>Should the Advisory Council have any questions or would like more information please contact Eileen Resnick, Director of Scientific Programs at SWHR.</p>

<p>Dear Advisory Council, for the past 7 years my siblings and I have been assisting my mother manage the challenges of Alzheimersdisease. I am a veteran of the nursing/psychiatric field with training in Geriatric Mental Health. When our mother began to show signs of the disease I urged her doctor to do a mini mental exam. At the time she scored below 20 and I believe this was due in part to the fact that she is Spanish speaking only and the test was designed for the English speaker. And I don't believe she comprehended its purpose and mostly joked around with the questions and answers. The fact remained that she missed all the critical orientation questions and her recent memory was severely impaired. Today she remains coherent, jovial and she converses easily. She has some difficulty with remote and recent memory, and item recognition, but she still recognizes familiar faces and is able to do most familiar tasks. She can still prepare simple meals, make coffee, and perform all ADLs. Recently, she has shown signs of new memory formation. These memories are based on new information obtained a month or two prior. The new memories are usually linked to an emotional response, eg; something she enjoys or wants to do. The new memories are formed after she has asked the same question repeatedly and it has been answered each time as though it was being asked for the first time. She has been on a combination of drugs called Namenda and Aricept, as well as the chewable version of Melatonin that only Trader Joes sells. She does not experience sundowning and sleeps 8 or 9 hours per night. She experiences one waking about 4 am when she takes another Melatonin and sleeps until 8 or 9 am. The geriatric mental health training I participated in was offered by the University Of Washington School of Social Work, it featured a wonderful section on a program called the Beyond Love Project. The project workbook was written by Moyra Jones and it is a community based model that can be adopted by any community. The Beyond Love Project utilizes the collaborative effort of various medical and legal professionals, as well a community volunteers to teach caregivers to care for themselves and their loved ones with compassion. It provides tools to assist caregivers in recognizing the stages ofdementing disorders, as well as the limitations and challenges of each stage. I have been working on distribution of pamphlets that are produced by the Dept of Health and Human Services to encourage education and early detection. But I am one person and it is not enough. Our Medical professionals are the first line of defense and often they are not aware of the early signs. My mother's own doctor said to me in horror "how did I not see this? I've known this woman for 10 years." I responded "she presents well doesn't she?" The truth is, like any other disease, the only way for a medical professional to detect this disease is by testing for it. My point here is that a Mini Mental Exam should be as standard as a colonoscopy or prostate exam at 55. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing about the new plan and I hope to be a part of bringing much needed services to my community. In the meantime, I will continue my efforts to bring awareness, education and support and advocacy to my community.</p>

<p>I have been conducting training for health care professionals for over 20 years, including physicians on Alzheimer's disease. It is a fact the thephysicians are not prepared to assess for symptoms of the disease nor able to cooperate with the community health and social agencies on coordinating services that are needed. There needs to be much more education at the basic level through the tele-health programs, especially in the rural areas, on basic skills in assessing for Alzheimer's</p>
<p>The other issue is the importance in establishing a base line for possible early signs of dementia -- i.e. MCI. About 80% of early assessments of MCI usually end up within 10 years or so being "diagnosed" as Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Suggestion is that a baseline, as one does for blood pressure, using a modified mini mental status test be made for the population starting at 50.</p>
<p>Redo it every year when visiting the doctors office -- and compare the changes. If there are changes then further investigation is needed with possibly early intervention using Aricept or Memantine. These have been shown to be effective together the earlier they are administered.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					September 27, 2011</p>
<p style="text-align:center">By Matthew P. Janicki, Ph.D. on behalf of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices</p>
<p>I am the co-chair, along with Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry, of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. The National Task Group was created in 2010 by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD), and my university center, the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging and Developmental Disabilities (Lifespan Health and Function) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Our charge was to examine the state of practices related to dementia and people with lifelong intellectual disabilities, their families and caregivers, and the organizations that support them, and provide commentary on what needs to be done to further services and practices in the United States related to this population. Our charge also was to provide information and recommendations to the Advisory Council formed under the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>To this end, the National Task Group, composed of some 100 administrators, academics, providers, clinicians, families, and advocates, have coalesced with a number of national disability and family based organizations, federal agencies, and provider representatives to create a report on our findings and recommendations. The report, "'<em>My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected By Dementia to Remain In Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em> " is currently in development and we anticipate having it launched at our next National Task Group meeting in November.</p>
<p>In advance of the release of our Report, it is timely to provide the Advisory Council with some key points from the Report for its use. We have prepared these comments, which I trust the Council members will find informative and helpful:</p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's disease and other dementias affects adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in similar ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound impact due to particular risk factors -- including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. While mostly the disease follows a typical course, at times some adults are profoundly and aggressively affected. Yet all need the typical types of supports and services usually associated with dementia-capable care. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- believe that adults with intellectual disabilities require the same early and periodic diagnostic services, community education, and community-based supports for themselves, their caregivers, and the organizations responsible for them, as do other adults with dementia in the general population</em>.</li>
<li>Many families are the primary lifetime caregivers for adults with intellectual disabilities and when Alzheimer's disease and dementia occurs, they are particularly affected and need considerable supports. These families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. Many such families are at a loss for providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes progressive and care demands overwhelm them. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased home-based supports for caregivers who remain the primaries for care for adults affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Many intellectual disabilities provider organizations that are the primary resources for residential and day supports are vexed by the emerging trend of increasing numbers of adults with intellectual disabilities in their services showing signs of early decline and dementia with potentially more demanding care needs. In such cases, staff may be unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and may misrepresent or ignore these changes, when early identification could prove beneficial. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and state disability authorities invest in increased education and training of personnel with respect to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and invest in promoting best practices in models of community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia</em>.</li>
<li>As it is important to pick up signs of dementia-related cognitive decline early on , we -- the National Task Group -- recommend that the nation's providers and health authorities undertake a program of early identification screening - beginning at age 50 for adults with intellectual disabilities and at age 40 for adults with Down syndrome and others at early risk. We recognize that the Advisory Council may be debating the issue of early identification and screening in the general population. In this regard, <em>the National Task Group</em> has identified a screening instrument, applicable particularly to adults with an intellectual disability, which seems to work as a first-instance screen and <em>recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to begin to identify those adults at risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia</em>.</li>
<li>Most adults with a lifelong intellectual disability live in community settings with support from families, friends and service providers. Research has shown that community-based models of care for adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia include community-based options, such as support for living at home or in small group homes, are viable and gaining preference for all individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and other dementia. Institutionalization of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia is anathema to the core beliefs and commitments to care practices in the intellectual disabilities field and such institutionalization (via use of long-term care facilities) has been shown to have an adverse affect on lifespan and quality of life. The group home model, where a handful of adults with intellectual disabilities and dementia live in a specialized care home, is becoming more prominent across the world. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- recommend that these models be expanded and an investment be made into enabling provider organizations to develop and maintain such care efforts, including developing more small community-based specialized 'dementia capable' group homes</em>.</li>
<li>Dementia has a devastating impact on all people one way or another -- including people with intellectual disabilities and the many families, friends, and staff involved as parents, siblings, advocates, and caregivers. <em>We -- the National Task Group -- wish to give emphasis to this point and ask the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to include concerns and considerations for people with lifelong intellectual disabilities in any and all documents, plans, and recommendations to Congress that are part of the work of the Council</em>. The National Task Group stands ready to assist and contribute to such efforts and is pleased that this Council recognizes Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as an ultimate public health issue and a problem to which we collectively need to attend.</li>

<p>My name is Lane Simonian. I am an historian. Seven years ago when my aunt and cousin were in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and my mother was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, I began searching for ways to prevent and treat the disease. As an historian, I began to collect a mass of abstracts and articles in an attempt to tell the story of Alzheimer's disease. At first with a limited background in biology, I made very slow progress in understanding Alzheimer's. Now, though, I can explain almost every new finding in regards to the disease with the attached hypothesis. What used to take me months to figure out now usually only takes a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The critical finding in regards to Alzheimer's disease was made by Mark Smith and his colleagues in 1997: Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease. This damage includes the oxidation (loss of electrons and hydrogen) of glucose transport systems, choline transport systems, the enzyme cholineacetyltransferase, g protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic, serotonin, dopamine, olfactory, adrenergic), the nitration of tau proteins, lipid peroxidation, and the influx of calcium. This damage results in a lack of focus and energy, impaired short-term memory due to a shortage of acetylcholine, disturbed sleep and mood, lack of awareness, impaired smell, behavioral problems (in some instances), disrupted neurotransmission, damage to cellular membranes, and neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>The factors that lead to peroxynitriteformation include (but again are not limited to) high glucose levels, high blood pressure, the APOE4 gene, presenilin gene mutations, bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs, late estrogen replacment therapy, mercury, aluminum fluoride, and stress. Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation also lead to Alzheimer's disease (the connection has not been made as of yet between bisphosphonateosteoporosis drugs and Alzheimer's disease, but the fact that the numbers of cases of Alzheimer's disease has skyrocketed since the introduction of these drugs is perhaps concerning).</p>
<p>Phenolic compounds in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils and polyunsatured fats inhibit peroxynitrite formation and thus inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease. The most direct and concentrated way to deliver phenolic compounds to the brain is through aromatherapy with essential oils high in phenoliccompounds.</p>
<p>An impressive number of animal studies, case studies, and clinical trials indicate that Alzheimer's disease can be treated effectively with peroxynitrite scavengers (compounds that are hydrogen donors convert peroxynitrites into a nitrogen dioxide anion and water). These scavengers partially reverse or prevent all of the damage done by peroxynitrites listed above (for example, they add hydrogen back to muscarinicreceptors allowing more choline to enter cells). In the reference section of the attached hypothesis you will find a partial list of peroxynitrite scavengers (most of them are phenolic compounds) which have helped correct cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. These include rosmarinic acid, grape seed extract, cinnamon extract, eugenol in Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil, and thymol and carvacrolin Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil. In addition, Jimbo and colleagues in Japan were able to improve cognitive function in dementia patients after giving them rosemary and lemon to smell in the morning and lavender and orange to smell in the evening for 28 days. Akhondzadeh and his colleagues achieved similar results using tinctures of sage and lemon balm essential oils for four months. One reviewer looking at this (and perhaps other clinical trials) concluded "excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated."</p>
<p>Several case studies add further validity to the findings from animal studies and clinical trials. Dramatic improvements in alertness and awareness and modest improvements in short-term memory have been noted. In my mother's case she recognizes her home again, feels comfortable around her brother who she used to think was an impostor, sleeps through the night, can recall her name and sometimes spell it, can sometimes remember the order of days and months, can complete phrases such as I scream, you scream, we all scream for...ice cream and April showers...bring May flowers, and is much more alert and aware than she was four years ago before we began aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Essential oils high in methoxyphenols (such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon leaf) and citrus based essential oils appear to work the best. The patient can smell them under each nostril for a few seconds. It takes about a month to begin seeing some improvement (perhaps because it takes time to reverse the damage that peroxynitrtes do to smell).</p>
<p>Let me highlight the critical points:</p>
<ul><li>Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and directly or indirectly causes all the features of the disease.</li>
<li>Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation can cause Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Compound which inhibit peroxynitriteformation inhibit the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>In animal studies, clinical trials, and case studies, peroxynitrite scavengers have lead to improvements in cognitive function.</li>
<li>Phenolic compounds can be used both to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, aromatherapy is likely the most effective way to deliver these compounds to the brain.</li>
<li>This disease can be treated effectively immediately with few side effects.</li>
</ul><p>I wish you good luck in your work. If the opportunity arises, I would like to meet each of you in person. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me. Nothing pleases me more when I receive questions from people interested in my research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's has a very simple and avoidable cause: steam-refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils. I have been working this out since 1990.</p>
<p>The unsuspected vitamin E deficiency in these widely consumed food oils leads to brain cell membrane oxidation, that impairs the function of important enzymes that normally degrade the beta-amyloid protein. This protein therefore accumulates, incredibly slowly, in the brain of a regular consumer of deodorized vegetable seed oils.</p>
<p>After the age of 65 or so, accumulated beta-amyloidmay release highly toxic soluble aggregates (called oligomers), that are the immediate cause of synaptic toxicity and neuronal death.</p>
<p>That is exactly how over 5 million Americans have ended up with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>My suggestion to your Government, is simply to legislate a requirement for all refined seed oils in your country to have any vitamin E deficit (usually 30%) corrected before distribution and sale. This simple step will also prevent ADHD occurring during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Already, this basic preventive step is under consideration by the Australian Government's Food Standards Authority, and we may be the first nation in the world to eliminate the twin brain epidemics of Alzheimer's and its prenatal partner, ADHD.</p>
<p>The USA--where vacuum steam-refining of seed oils was invented, in 1899 (David Wesson, Savannah)--has no shortage of brain power. What you lack is a safe level of vitamin E in your brain-oxidizing vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Can you fix the problem, and catch up with Australia?</p>
<p>When your Norfolk, Virginia shipyards were mass-producing Liberty ships for WW2 Atlantic convoys, a large banner was hung across the docks, saying:</p>
<p>IT CAN AND WILL BE DONE!!</p>
<p>Can you make vegetable oils safe? Can you do this too?</p>
<p>I attach a draft hypothesis for your inspection: I shall be trimming it down shortly, for submission to The Lancet, in London.</p>
<p>Here, at long last, is the direct cause of the disease: knowing this, we can easily prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease And Attention Deficit Disorder May Share A Single Cause: Refined Vegetable Oil</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>By Dr Robert Peers, General Practitioner, North Carlton, MELBOURNE</strong></p>
<p>In 1990 I identified a potential cause of typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), reporting my findings (a small case/control study) in a letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal [Ref 1] in 1993 (letter: "Alzheimer's Disease And Vegetable Oils"). I found that 12 cases of diagnosed AD had all consumed refined polyunsaturated seed oils for many years, contrasting with 20 age-matched control subjects with good memories, none of whom used such oils.</p>
<p>The reason for seeking a dietary cause was simple and compelling: AD had been seen to sometimes affect only one of a pair of identical twins [Ref 2], a striking finding that points strongly to some toxic or dietary cause. In addition, it was very unlikely to be caused by ageing itself, since the other twin was the same age, but remained unaffected in the long term; and because most older people do not in fact get the disease. I reasoned that those who were affected were somehow getting it from their diet, but how?</p>
<p>My initial reading even disclosed a likely dietary suspect: Professor Scott Henderson, an Australian research psychiatrist, cites in his 1988 AD review/hypothesis paper [Ref 3] a remarkable study [Ref 4] done by Professor Denham Harman in 1976, in Nebraska. Harman had a free radical theory of ageing, and knowing that both seed oils and the brain are rich in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids, he wondered whether feeding safflower oil to his rats might cause free radical damage to the brain: it certainly did, as his rats soon lost their way in a maze. Furthermore, giving vitamin E to a new group of rats, fed the same oil, prevented these cognitive deficits--a finding that suggests that his oil, and perhaps other seed oils too, were low in vitamin E.</p>
<p>This work made me very curious about common vegetable seed oils, which were well known to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk, but nobody had previously suspected them of actually causing a disease, and here they were evidently oxidizing the brain!</p>
<p>Soon after setting out on my library search for a dietary factor in 1990, I discovered that deodorized seed oils lose about a third of their antioxidant vitamin E during refining [Ref 5]--a potentially serious deficiency not seen in the soft margarines made from the same oils, which suffer polyunsaturate losses during hydrogenation, restoring the vitamin E/polyunsaturate balance. I realized immediately how important this deficiency would be in the brain, whose nerve cell membranes are very rich in highly oxidizable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Since the main function of vitamin E is to protect these vulnerable essential fatty acids against oxidation, a low level of vitamin E in the nerve cell membrane would invite cerebral "lipid peroxidation". Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids breaks up the fatty acid chain, and among the fragments are neurotoxic aldehyde molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidized Omega-6 fatty acids, in particular, release the highly reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), whose toxic effects on nerve synapses may account for the faulty memory seen in "Seed Oil Syndrome", described below. But 4-HNE does more than that: it activates a key enzyme involved in AD development, and may also--more importantly--mediate the impaired beta-amyloid clearance caused by cerebral lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Elena Tamagno, in Turin, has shown [Ref 6], in recent years, that 4- HNE indirectly activates the pivotal AD enzyme beta-secretase (BACE 1), a small rise in the activity of which causes a sharp increase in betaamyloid formation [S Cole, Ref 7]. Beta-amyloid is a peptide--a small protein fragment--that is the molecular cause of AD, as in rare genetic cases, where a gene mutation increases the production of a more toxic form of this peptide (the longer form, with 42 aminoacids, rather than the 40 residues seen in the much less toxic and more abundant form).</p>
<p>Although small amounts of this important protein fragment are produced in the normal brain, it is easily cleared away by degrading enzymes, and it can also exit the brain through the blood-brain barrier. However, people consuming refined vegetable oil will be forming increased beta-amyloid in abnormal oxidizing conditions, that may damage the clearance mechanism, resulting in progressive betapeptide accumulation and, ultimately, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One possibility is that lipid peroxidation products, like the same 4-HNE, might inhibit a key clearance enzyme, called Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (which also degrades beta-amyloid). In fact, an amyloid clearance problem is all that is required to cause AD, since even a mild over-production of beta-amyloid--as I postulate above--may still be successfully cleared.</p>
<p>So my theory does require a clearance defect, whether or not amyloid production is increased. And now, in 2009, Dr Y Nishida in Japan has shown [Ref 8] that by blocking vitamin E transport to mouse brain, lipid membrane peroxidation ensues, which impairs beta-amyloid clearance, by somehow reducing the expression of the gene coding for the above Insulin-Degrading Enzyme. Vitamin E-depleted seed oils, likewise, lower vitamin E levels in most tissues, causing lipid peroxidation [Y H Wang, Ref 9], which must include the brain, as shown by the early cognitive deficits seen in Harman's pioneering work (above), and their notable prevention with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Common Omega-6 seed oils, which are usually steam-deodorized, have been linked to cognitive decline in Holland [S Kalmijn, Ref 10], and also in Greece [D Psaltopoulou, Ref 11]), and to over double the risk of incident dementia (70% being AD) in the prospective "Three Cities Study" in France [P Barberger-Gateau, Ref 12]. Processed safflower oil, as discussed above, was shown many years ago (1976!) to cause memory faults in rats, which could be prevented with vitamin E. For some reason, Dr Harman did not alert the US food safety authorities to this alarming discovery.</p>
<p>Low vitamin E levels in corn, soya and safflower oils were first demonstrated by Dr David Herting in Rochester, New York State (Ref 5--see "herting d and 1963" on <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>, to find and download his free Journal of Nutrition paper). He concluded that widespread vitamin E deficiency would occur in populations consuming processed polyunsaturated seed oils. However, he did not realize the extreme peroxidation vulnerability of the brain and retina, where reduced vitamin E levels mean rapid lipid peroxidation of long-chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, in synapses and in retinal rod cell disc membranes. Had he known this, he could have predicted a new disease of the brain, with the further possibility of a new childhood brain disorder, arising in the fetal brain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It was precisely these most vulnerable tissues that were tragically ignored in the landmark nutritional study, completed in 1960 in Illinois, on which current recommended daily intake of vitamin E is based [Ref 13]. Although lead investigator Dr Max Horwitt should have been aware of the brain's rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mentioned, for example, in 1950s biochemistry texts), he judged vitamin E requirement exclusively by testing the fragility of red blood cell membranes in vitamin E-deprived human subjects, finding even greater fragility when the subjects were given vitamin E-stripped corn oil.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Horwitt to ask his vitamin E-deprived subjects about higher mental functions like memory or mood. Memory difficulties (and glare sensitivity and night-blindness from retinal damage) are likely to occur long before the red cell test becomes positive in response to gradual dietary vitamin E depletion, because the oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are much less concentrated in the red cell membrane, than in retina and brain. Lipid peroxidation is a very rapid chain-reaction, that proceeds much faster in a vitamin E-depleted cell membrane containing a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when those fatty acids--as in brain and retina--are of the long-chain variety, full of oxidizable double bonds.</p>
<p>To his credit, Horwitt did realize that the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids, so he based the recommended daily intake on the ratio of vitamin E to the intake of these fatty acids. He assumed that higher polyunsaturate intake, for example seed oil, would automatically mean higher vitamin E intake, but neglected the possibility that processed seed oils might lose some of this vitamin E during refining, and so cause some new disease specifically involving tissues prone to lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Indeed, he failed to pursue this possibility, even when he found that some members of staff at the Elgin Mental Hospital, who were not on the vitamin E deficient test diet, also had an abnormal red cell test. He did not ask himself how that could have happened, but could have taken a dietary history, and might have discovered that they were consumers of common vegetable oils, which could therefore have had something in common with his experimental stripped corn oil: low content of vitamin E. He may then have gone on to investigate the vitamin E content of such oils, and found it to be low--as David Herting found three years later, in 1963. Had Horwitt detected mild memory faults in consumers of refined seed oils, and set himself to do a little thinking, he could have nipped Alzheimer's in the bud, in 1960.</p>
<p>Any child, young person or adult consuming refined seed oils will report, if asked, memory problems, poor dark adaptation and glare sensitivity (photophobia--which is irreversible). I discovered this syndrome in general practice, and I call it Seed Oil Syndrome, and it probably reflects 4-HNE neurotoxicity in the synapses. Lipid peroxidation, which in the long term causes impaired beta-amyloid clearance, has early clinical effects due to synaptic damage: 4-HNE impairs neuronal glucose uptake, among other effects.</p>
<p>I have seen this hitherto undescribed syndrome in 100s of oil-using patients in family practice, over many years. The memory responds well to vitamin E (I sometimes add fish oil, for a faster response), except after the age of 50 or so, when subjects report long-term stability of memory, without actual improvement.</p>
<p>I am hoping that these cases, who, after some 20-30 years of refined oil exposure, may have a significant brain amyloid load, will not progress to AD, once off seed oils, and using olive oil, vitamin E and fish oil supplement. I also have some of them on Inositol, a seed sugar known to neutralize toxic Abeta oligomers [Ref 14] and improve language and orientation in established AD [Ref 15].</p>
<p>This simple glucose isomer, which is easily obtained in the diet (from grains, nuts, legumes, soymilk, cantaloupe and citrus), may prove to be a powerful weapon--along with cessation of refined-oil exposure-- in preventing Seed Oil Syndrome progressing slowly to Mild Cognitive Impairment and, ultimately, diagnosed AD. Given the extensive neuronal damage already evident in these two later stages, ultra-early prevention is now thought to be the only way to stop this disease, and nutrition--if it can do the job--is far preferable to preventive drugs.</p>
<p>From the public health angle, all cases of Seed Oil Syndrome--which is easily identified by symptoms and diet history--should change to olive oil (or any cold-pressed oil), eat a high.Inositol diet (even citrus juice is very rich in Inositol), and preferably take fish-oil capsules as well.</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake from butter, cream, cheese, fatty meat, pastries etc., must also be reduced, for it commonly causes co-morbid vascular dementia in the Alzheimer victim.</p>
<p>Inositol, given as a higher dose (5 gm/day) via supplement, also reverses anxiety disorder and depression [Ref 16], which affect perhaps 40% of AD cases. Anxiety alone doubles the risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD [Ref 17], possibly because of cortisol-induced hippocampal damage, low Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels and poor hippocampal neurogenesis. Depression, often resulting from anxiety plus fatty diet, may increase inflammation--pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1-beta may aggravate neuronal damage and increase stress axis activation even further. Anti-anxiety doses of Inositol also have a place here, by greatly decreasing stress-induced comfort-eating of fatty foods like chocolate, cheese, cakes and pastries [author's clinical observations].</p>
<p>One extra benefit from Inositol in brain disease is its unexpected antiageing effect [Ref 18], a possible example of which is the NIH 31 grain-rich mouse diet, that prolongs the median lifespan of female mice by 25% [Ref 19]. By altering the same genes that are altered by caloric restriction--including the key mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC 1 alpha--Inositol is clearly a caloric restriction mimetic, with the same potential as dietary restriction to provide neurotrophic, antioxidant and energizing benefits in brain, as described by nutritional neuroscientist Mark Mattson [Ref 20]. Already, a multiple sclerosis animal model has been found to respond well to caloric restriction [Ref 21]: Inositol is a more practical intervention.</p>
<p>Variations in AD incidence around the world (low in West Africa, very high in Wadi Ara Arabs in Israel, 4 times higher in Pittsburgh than in Ballabgarh, Northern India) probably reflect local patterns of refined seed oil consumption. In Northern India, unrefined traditional oils are still very popular (eg. pungent mustard oil, crude peanut oil), and in the South there is mostly coconut oil and crude peanut oil--and possibly an even lower AD rate.</p>
<p>Refined oils are, however, encroaching on these traditional markets. Palm oil is the main cooking oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, where AD rates may be low, but in the US and Europe--and the Middle East too-- refined oils are the rule, apart from those people lucky enough to still use mainly olive oil. A study in Bari, Italy, some years ago, showed cognitive decline in older subjects not using olive oil [Ref 22]; they were apparently using common refined supermarket seed oils, which are widely used in Italy for frying.</p>
<p>An oil that causes a serious brain disease in adult life might also be expected to affect the fetal brain: when asking many oil-using patients about symptoms of Seed Oil Syndrome, I have noticed--as a family doctor--that young adults with the syndrome frequently have children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I proceeded to do a pilot case/control study on retrospective pregnancy diet, in 80 cases versus 80 controls.</p>
<p>Almost all (78) of the mothers of ADHD cases gave a history of regular consumption of refined seed oils during all or part of the pregnancy, often from fried takeaway food. All of these mothers had permanent glare sensitivity (most carried sunglasses, usually perched conveniently on their head), and those who still consumed these oils had ongoing memory difficulties and impaired night vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have met young adults with residual ADHD, who report that their mother, if still using such oils, and now in her mid- to lateforties, has an obvious memory problem. The Scottish breath-analysis scientist Brian Ross has found evidence of lipid peroxidation (increased breath ethane gas) in some children with ADHD [Ref 23], probably due to ongoing childhood exposure to the same refined seed oils that caused their condition during gestation.</p>
<p>In my child patients, such further exposure significantly worsens the ADHD, by increasing cognitive problems, mood issues, aggression and impulsivity--all of which improve rapidly by stopping the exposure and recommending fish oil, to assist synaptic recovery and plasticity. Not only does fish oil work faster when refined oils are first excluded from the diet (to prevent peroxidative destruction of the fish oil fatty acids in vitamin E-depleted synapses), but the synaptic benefits of fish oil may be greatly enhanced by adding two more "synaptic building blocksh--uridine and choline--as proposed for Alzheimer's, by nutritional neuroscientist Dr Richard Wurtman, at the Massachusets Institute of Technology [Ref 24]. Uridine sources include brewer's yeast, broccoli and beetroot, while choline is found in egg, chicken, lecithin and wheat germ. Wurtman's "Souvenaid" synapse-restoring mixture, which increases synaptic density and cognitive function in gerbil rats, does improve Alzheimer symptoms, and may work even better in the developing ADHD brain of a young child, to the extent that usual medications for the latter disorder may become obsolete, due to advances in brain nutrition.</p>
<p>I believe there is enough evidence available to conclude that deodorized seed oils are a major public health hazard, being directly responsible for ADHD, widespread Seed Oil Syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. I notice in my clinic that Seed Oil Syndrome causes depression and irritability in anxious subjects, and aggravates ADHD in children and adolescents, promoting delinquency, serious aggression, antisocial behaviour, and substance abuse. These problems are now endemic in Western cities, and increasing world-wide.</p>
<p>Correction of all such brain peroxidation problems is very simple: to protect their citizens, while at the same time keeping these heartfriendly oils available, governments must be persuaded to pass laws requiring that all deodorized seed oils be rendered safe, with respect to their vitamin E content, before being sold. Natural vitamin E can 8 easily be recovered from the steam distillate at the food oil refinery, and replaced in the deodorized oil: or synthetic vitamin E could be used instead. Urgent action is required.</p>
<p>The highly desirable result of fixing this seed oil catastrophe would be to eliminate the twin epidemics of Alzheimer's and ADHD, along with the alarming antisocial effects of refined seed oils, as specified above.</p>

<p>I have two questions: will there be public comment at any or all of the advisory council meetings and what would be the best way to communicate with members of the committee?</p>
<p>Based on animal model studies, clinical trials, and case studies (including my mother), I know how to treat this disease and likely how to delay its onset. In the hypothesis, you will find references that show that peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and that this damage can partially be corrected with peroxynitrite scavengers. Some of the most effective scavengers are methoxyphenols (eugenol,thymol, and carvacrol) in various essential oils (such as cinnamon leaf, clove, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and sage) in part because they can be inhaled directly into to the part of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease: the hippocampus.</p>
<p>With some help from this committee, it is likely that Alzheimer's disease could be effectively treated within this next year.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
