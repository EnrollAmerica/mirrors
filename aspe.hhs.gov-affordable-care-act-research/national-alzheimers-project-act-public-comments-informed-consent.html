<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>

</ul><p><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

Can you please forward this information to the Advisory Committee that is studying human research testing for citizens with Alzheimer's disease who may not be able to give informed consent.</p>
<p><strong>NUREMBERG CODE </strong></p>
<ol><li>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonable to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.
<p>						The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.</p></li>
<li>The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.</li>
<li>The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.</li>
<li>The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.</li>
<li>No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.</li>
<li>The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.</li>
<li>Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.</li>
<li>The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.</li>
<li>During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.</li>
<li>During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.</li>

<p>What EXACTLY is HHS and NIH doing to ensure that people who are enrolled in your Medical (Human) Research and Clinical Trials that you are desperately trying to recruit Alzheimer's patients for have the CAPACITY to give INFORMED CONSENT?</p>
<p>History has shown that some of the most abusive governments in History used vulnerable elderly and incapacitated patients for medical and human research. This was addressed international laws and federal laws in this country.</p>
<p>As an elder rights advocate, I am extremely concerned about the mad rush to do testing on individuals who have been declared incompetent or incapacitated and who do not have the capacity to give informed consent. No surrogate decision maker should be allowed to give informed consent on behalf of any other human being. The surrogate decision maker cannot feel the pain and horrific side effects and the incapacitated person with Alzheimer's may suffer immensely but not be able to even communicate the pain they are involuntarily being forced to endure.</p>
<p>What do you plan to do about this? An all out campaign is needed to HALT any plans to use incapacitated Alzheimer's and dementia patients for human research trials (including drug and other medical research) without informed consent being provided by the individual who will be subjected to the human research and testing!</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td><strong><em>Charlie Glabe</em></strong> (University of California Davis)</td>
<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<td>
<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities. Matching funds from the government for private initiatives, or the other way around, could generate considerably more private capital for focused, high level science than is the case today.</li>

<td>In regard to 1E below, there is nothing wrong with what is stated but this is not the problem! We need treatments! If there is nothing to disseminate, 1E is a waste of time. Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately. This may require new partnerships within the Federal Government and with the private sector, and outreach through new mechanisms.</td>

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>
</tr><tr><th colspan="2" scope="row">Beth Bishop (Volunteer -- Alzheimer's Association (via Alz Forum))</th>
<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<p>Presently there are no approved treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cure this devastating disease. Filling the AD drug pipeline will require facilitating translation of basic research discoveries and increasing collaboration with the FDA and international regulatory agencies. The Critical Path Institute, working in a public-private partnership with the FDA, created the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) to identify improved methods and tools that accelerate drug development in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. NIA contributes to the consensus science for AD drug development tools in CAMD, as do our 16 member companies and other key stakeholders.</p>
<p>The goal of improving the drug development process for Alzheimer's disease can be addressed by incorporating the following actions into the National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>Widespread adoption and use of the AD data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) to facilitate data sharing. These CDISC AD data standards should be used in all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials. While the FDA currently encourages sponsors to use CDISC standards when submitting data, the ability for the FDA to require such standards in applications should be considered. The AD data standards should be frequently updated and expanded to cover any new measures.</li>
<li>Construction of a comprehensive AD clinical natural history database that could be mined by qualified investigators. This database should contain both control and active intervention arms of clinical trials and include trials of failed drugs. For optimal data mining, the data should be deposited in CDISC format with legacy data remapped to the AD data standards. Such a database, whether constructed by a foundation or a public-private partnership, would need to address privacy and informed consent concerns as well as liability issues. Moreover, a mechanism to protect proprietary, confidential data would need to be built in. Incentives for pharmaceutical companies to submit deidentified and appropriately coded treatment arm data include immediate access to a rick source of pooled data. Data mining of the AD clinical database should provide information on which biomarkers accurately track disease progression and response or non-response to treatment. This aggregated mega-database should also offer valuable insights for repurposing drugs.</li>
<li>Regulatory qualification of biomarkers that can be applied to testing new AD drugs. Progress in developing AD drugs has been hampered by the lack of biomarkers qualified by regulatory agencies for testing efficacy, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. While AD researchers have identified some tantalizing candidates, providing the level of evidence needed for FDA qualification typically requires additional evidence and analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of individual companies or academic researchers, and are best carried out through a public-private partnership/consortium model (e.g. ADNI, CAMD).</li>
<li>Development of analytic standards and reliable methods for measuring AD biomarkers. The lack of standardization for imaging modalities and/or assays of CSF analytes can prevent the FDA from accepting a biomarker for use in AD clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods, together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples, should be a national priority.</li>
<li>Development of quantitative disease progression models to inform the design of AD clinical trials and evaluate new medicines. Mathematical models offer ways to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times, identify subpopulations with unique characteristics, assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response, and more. In short, models can prevent a good drug from failing, and keep bad drugs off the market. Modeling and simulation tools can be built using the clinical data of a large AD database, such as the one constructed by CAMD that contains ~ 6000 AD patients enrolled in the control arm of clinical trials. Even larger databases with cognitively normal controls and patients at the earliest stages of the disease, along with richer sources of biomarker information on these patients, should be constructed to facilitate the decision-making process in prevention trials as well as AD clinical trials. These quantitative disease models need to be evaluated by the FDA and accepted as "fit for use" so that the pharmaceutical companies can better design AD clinical trials.</li>
</ol><p>Each of these drug development tools fall within the "precompetitive space", where the knowledge gained and time saved can benefit individual company efforts to bring new drugs to the market. The National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease would benefit by incorporating these action items to spur the development of safe and effective medicines for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease.</p>

<p>How exactly can these clinical trials be conducted on individuals with cognitive disorders? How do they give informed consent ?</p>
<p>A guardians should NEVER be allowed to give consent for testing and for that matter no person other than the subject who will be tested should be allowed to give informed consent for clinical trials.</p>
<p>Can the proxy individual who is giving informed consent feel the physiological consequences? I think not and this practice is in violation of international human research testing laws I believe.</p>
<p>What is being done to protect the incapacitated from being placed involuntarily into clinical trials?</p>
